The Judiciary & Hawaiian Affairs (JHA) committee's scope includes \"programs relating to the courts, crime prevention and control, penal code, criminal enforcement, police and law enforcement, prosecution, sentencing, disposition, and punishment, probation, parole, furlough, and other alternatives to incarceration, indigent legal representation and defense matters, civil law, firearms, weapons, judicial and legal questions, constitutional matters, the Attorney General, the Judiciary, individual rights, civil rights and liberties, the Civil Rights Commission, the Ethics Code, campaign spending, and elections.\" This bill clearly falls under JHA's responsibility regarding the penal code and criminal law. There is no appropriation language or other elements that would necessitate referral to the Finance committee or any other committee based on the provided rules."

Amending the Hawaii Revised Statutes concerning administrative procedures falls directly under the purview of legal framework oversight, as it dictates how state agencies exercise their delegated legal authority. The Attorney General and Judiciary are often involved in the review and interpretation of administrative rules.\n\n**LMG (Legislative Management):** This committee's scope includes 'administrative operations' and the 'Public Access Room.' The bill's focus on requiring 'electronic notice' and internet posting for proposed rules directly relates to enhancing public access to administrative processes, improving transparency, and standardizing 'administrative operations' across state agencies. While LMG's primary focus is House operations, the 'administrative operations' and 'public access' elements can extend to statewide administrative processes concerning public information."
