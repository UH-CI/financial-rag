    "reasoning": "This bill is titled 'RELATING TO STATUTORY REVISION' and its description specifies 'Amends or repeals various provisions of the Hawaii Revised Statutes or the Session Laws of Hawaii for the purposes of correcting errors and references, clarifying language, or deleting obsolete or unnecessary provisions.' This indicates a broad, technical clean-up bill affecting multiple parts of the Hawaii Revised Statutes.\n\n1.  **JHA (Judiciary & Hawaiian Affairs)**: This committee is appropriate because the bill involves 'judicial and legal questions' and amends several sections related to civil and criminal law (e.g., statute of limitations for sexual abuse, dangerous dog provisions, compelling witness appearance). Its role is crucial for ensuring the legal soundness of statutory revisions.\n2.  **LMG (Legislative Management)**: This committee's scope includes 'administrative operations and legislative services of the House, including the Legislative Reference Bureau'. Statutory revision bills are inherently tied to legislative services and the work of the Legislative Reference Bureau in maintaining and clarifying state statutes.\n3.  **FIN (Finance)**: The bill amends Section 102-2, which relates to 'bidding requirements' and falls under FIN's explicit scope of 'procurement and the Procurement Code'. It also amends definitions for 'financial institutions' in Section 412:1-109 and references a 'special fund' in Section 291C-6, further solidifying FIN's jurisdiction over financial policies and public funds.\n4.  **EEP (Energy & Environmental Protection)**: The bill includes substantive amendments in Sections 3 and 4 (related to 103D-412 and 196-9) concerning definitions, requirements, and goals for 'alternative fuels', 'zero-emission vehicles', and the 'electrification of transportation' for state fleets. These changes directly align with EEP's scope regarding 'energy resources', 'energy efficiency', 'electrification of transportation', and 'climate change mitigation'.\n\nThe order of referral prioritizes the overarching legal and legislative administrative aspects (JHA, LMG) for a statutory revision bill, followed by committees with significant specific jurisdictional claims (FIN, EEP) based on the substantive policy areas touched by the revisions."
