    "reasoning": "The bill seeks to amend Section 712-1231 of the Hawaii Revised Statutes, which is part of the penal code relating to gambling. Its core purpose is to modify the affirmative defense of social gambling by adding conditions related to noise complaints and the monopolization of police resources. The Committee on Judiciary & Hawaiian Affairs (JHA) has scope over programs relating to the courts, crime prevention and control, penal code, criminal enforcement, police and law enforcement, and prosecution. This bill directly falls within these responsibilities. There is no direct link to state financing (FIN) as there are no appropriations, nor to constitutional matters. While the bill mentions 'residential neighborhoods' and 'noise complaints,' the primary legislative action is an amendment to criminal law and its enforcement, which is firmly within JHA's purview, rather than direct regulation of housing or environmental noise that would fall under other committees like Housing (HSG), Consumer Protection & Commerce (CPC) for residential codes, or Energy & Environmental Protection (EEP) for environmental health."

This directly impacts 'taxation and other revenues' and 'state financing policies,' making the **Finance (FIN)** committee a necessary referral as per Rule 13.2(1).\n\nAdditionally, the bill specifies that 'Individual housing accounts' must be held by a 'bank, a savings and loan association, a credit union, or a depository financial services loan company' whose 'accounts are insured.' The regulation of 'financial institutions' and the 'Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs' falls under the scope of the **Consumer Protection & Commerce (CPC)** committee, making it an appropriate referral for oversight related to the administration of these accounts by regulated entities."

    "reasoning": "The bill is titled 'RELATING TO THE JUDICIARY' and serves as the 'Judiciary Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2024,' making the **Judiciary & Hawaiian Affairs (JHA)** committee the primary body. Its scope includes 'programs relating to the courts' and 'the Judiciary,' which directly covers the program appropriations for courts of appeal, judicial circuits, the judicial selection commission, and administration. The repeal of the inmate reporting requirement, stemming from supreme court orders, also falls within JHA's purview regarding judicial actions and oversight.\n\nThe bill is fundamentally an 'Appropriations Act,' detailing 'PROGRAM APPROPRIATIONS,' 'CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS,' and the 'ISSUANCE OF BONDS,' and explicitly discusses 'expenditures' and exceeding the 'state general fund expenditure ceiling.' Therefore, the **Finance (FIN)** committee is essential. Rule 13.2 mandates FIN's 'final responsibility over all programs and matters relating to the State's financing policies, including taxation and other revenues, level of expenditures, cash and debt management, and to the statewide implementation of planning, programming, budgeting, and evaluation.'\n\nAdditionally, the bill includes a specific 'CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECT' for 'KAPUAIWA BUILDING SEPARATE STORM DRAIN AND BASEMENT LEVEL SANITORY SYSTEMS, OAHU.' The **Water & Land (WAL)** committee's scope includes 'land and water resource administration and use' and 'infrastructure development.' Storm drains and sanitary systems are directly related to water infrastructure and land use, making WAL an appropriate committee for oversight of this specific project's implications."

The core of this bill falls directly within these areas.\n2.  **Finance (FIN):** The prompt explicitly states that 'a bill discussing a constitutional amendment should be assigned to both the JHA and FIN committees'. Beyond this rule, changes to the administrative structure of a state department, including creating an elected position for a department head, inherently involve 'overall state financing policies', 'level of expenditures', and 'budgeting and evaluation' due to election costs, salary implications, and changes in financial oversight.\n3.  **Labor (LAB):** The bill significantly alters the method of selecting the head of a state department from an appointed official under the governor's supervision to an elected official. This directly impacts 'government operations and efficiency', 'employee pay and benefits' (for the sheriff position), and the broader 'civil service system' framework for high-level state positions, even if the sheriff itself is not civil service."
