BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1. The legislature finds that teachers are fundamental to shaping the future of Hawai \u02bb i's keiki and communities. However, rural and underserved areas of the State still face significant challenges in attracting and retaining qualified educators due to limited affordable housing options and the State's high cost of living. The legislature further finds that challenges with teacher retention have resulted in a growing reliance on emergency hires and long-term substitutes, which can negatively affect the quality of education for students and place additional financial strain on the department of education. Addressing teacher retention is critical to reducing educational disparities and ensuring equitable access to high-quality learning opportunities for all students in public and charter schools. The legislature therefore finds that providing financial assistance for housing through a teacher workforce housing stipend program would support teacher retention in rural and underserved communities. Additionally, a stipend program would help alleviate economic burdens and encourage educators to make long-term commitments to teaching in rural and underserved communities. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to establish a teacher workforce housing stipend program to strengthen the teaching profession, support educational equity, and invest in the success of Hawai \u02bb i's students and schools. SECTION 2. Chapter 302A, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to part III, subpart E, to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: \" \u00a7302A- Teacher workforce housing; stipend program; rural and underserved schools. (a) There is established a teacher workforce housing stipend program to be administered by the department to support teacher retention at any public school designated as rural or in an underserved area. (b) An individual shall be eligible for stipend consideration if the individual: (1) Is employed full-time by the department in a public or charter school in an area designated as rural or underserved; and (2) Does not own a residence within commuting distance from the school at which they are employed. (c) Stipend recipients shall receive $1,000 per month; provided that stipends awarded shall only be used only for rent or utilities. Recipients of the teacher workforce housing stipend shall submit annual documentation verifying the usage of the stipend for housing purposes pursuant to this subsection. (d) Immediately following an award of a stipend, the recipient shall commit to teaching at a school in an area designated as rural or underserved for a minimum of three years. A stipend recipient may continue to receive a stipend pursuant to this section following the completion of the designated number of years; provided that the recipient continues to meet eligibility requirements pursuant to subsection (b). (e) If the recipient fails to satisfy the work requirements in accordance with subsection (d), the recipient shall repay the total amount of the stipend funds received as a loan repayable to the department. The repayment shall be subject to the terms and conditions set by the department. (f) The department shall submit a report of its findings and recommendations, including any proposed legislation, to the legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the regular session for every odd-numbered year, beginning with the regular session of 2027. \" SECTION 3.

BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1. This Act shall be known and may be cited as the \"State Internship and Workforce Development Act.\" SECTION 2. The legislature finds that state departments and agencies face significant challenges in filling vacant positions with qualified candidates. These staff shortages lead to inefficiencies and prevent the State from optimally fulfilling its public duties. The legislature further finds that many individuals, particularly recent graduates and those pursuing new career paths, lack opportunities to gain hands-on work experience in public service roles. This presents an opportunity for the State to support workforce development while addressing vacancies in public service positions. The legislature recognizes that a structured, state-funded internship program can serve as a pipeline for recruiting and retaining skilled workers in state government. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to establish a state-funded internship program that provides participants with practical work experience, fosters interest in public service careers, and helps address workforce shortages in state departments and agencies. SECTION 3. Chapter 78, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: \" §78- State internship and workforce development program.
