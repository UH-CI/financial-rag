BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1. The legislature acknowledges that according to the American Community Survey (ACS), median rent in Hawaii was $1,868 in 2022, the highest in the nation and $600 more than the national average. This has serious impacts on economic and housing security for the approximately forty per cent of Hawaii households who rent. According to university of Hawaii economic research organization, in 2024, roughly fifty-six per cent of renters were rent burdened, meaning they spend more than thirty per cent of their income on rent. Of those rent burdened households, twenty-eight per cent were severely burdened, meaning that they spend more than half of the income on rent. The legislature finds that average rents rose roughly eleven per cent between April 2023 and April 2024, with some markets experiencing much more drastic and disruptive increases. Unexpected and drastic rent increases can be highly detrimental to the financial stability and housing security of tenants, even resulting in displacement and homelessness. Research shows that residential instability has negative impacts on mental health, educational attainment, and economic well-being. The legislature further finds that anti-gouging laws can protect long-term renters from displacement due to excessive rent increase. Anti-gouging laws are broad protections that set caps on rent increases to protect renters from the most drastic rises in housing costs. The purpose of this Act is to improve housing stability for renters and prevent displacement by prohibiting landlords from increasing the gross rental rate by a certain amount over the course of twelve months. SECTION 2. Chapter 521, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to part II be appropriately designated and to read as follows: \"§521- Gross rental rates; limitations on increases. (a) Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, subject to subsection (c), no landlord shall, over the course of any twelve-month period, increase the gross rental rate for a dwelling unit by more than the lesser of: (1) Seven per cent plus the percentage change in the cost of living over the twelve-month period; or (2) Ten per cent; provided that if the annual allowable increase does not completely cover a landlord's yearly increase in operating and maintenance expenses for a property, a landlord may increase the base rent up to an additional seven per cent. In determining the lowest gross rental rate pursuant to this section, any rent discounts, incentives, concessions, or credits offered by the landlord of the dwelling unit and accepted by the tenant shall be excluded. The monthly gross rental rate and any owner-offered discounts, incentives, concessions, charges, or credits shall be separately listed and identified in the rental agreement or any amendments to an existing rental agreement. (b) If the same tenant remains in occupancy of the dwelling unit over any twelve-month period, the gross rental rate for the dwelling unit shall not be increased in more than two increments over that twelve-month period, subject to other restrictions of this section governing gross rental increase. (c) A tenant shall not enter into a sublease that results in a total rent for the dwelling unit that exceeds the allowable gross rental rate authorized by subsection (a). Nothing in this section shall authorize a tenant to sublet or assign the tenant's interest in the dwelling unit where otherwise prohibited. (d) The landlord shall provide written notice to the tenant of any increase in the rental rate sixty days before the effective date of the rate increase; provided that this subsection shall not apply when the tenancy is from month to month or less than month to month. (e) This section shall not apply to rental housing projects funded or operated by a government agency. (f) For purposes of this section: \"Operating and maintenance expense\" includes repairs, maintenance, pest control, garbage, and water expenses. \"Operating and maintenance expense\" does not include real property taxes, electric, gas, and management expenses. \"Percentage change in the cost of living\" means the percentage change in the regional Consumer Price Index in which the dwelling unit is located, as published by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, from the month of the notice and twelve months before the notice. If a regional index is not available, the Consumer Price Index, for All Urban Consumers, All Items, for Urban Hawaii and United States, as determined by the department of business, economic development, and tourism, shall apply.\" SECTION 3. New statutory material is underscored. SECTION 4. This Act shall take effect upon its approval and shall apply to rental agreements entered into or renewed before, on, and after the effective date of this Act. Report Title: Residential Landlord-Tenant Code; Rent Increases; Caps; Cost of Living Description: Prohibits landlords from increasing the gross rental rate for a dwelling unit by more than the lesser of seven per cent plus the percentage change in the cost of living or ten per cent over any twelve-month period. Requires sixty days' written notice for rent increases.

        "bill_intro": "HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES H.B. NO. 743 THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 STATE OF HAWAII A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to fiscal sustainability. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1. The legislature finds that maintaining fiscal sustainability during development is critical. New development proposals need to be evaluated not only against adopted development regulations and construction standards, but should be judged, in part, based on the long-term revenues and costs incurred by public entities. The legislature further finds that land use planning would benefit from incorporating a methodology that evaluates existing and proposed development by their expected fiscal contributions and ongoing costs for services and infrastructure. Such a methodology would give decision-makers and the public the information needed to assess both individual project proposals and regional investments. The development of such a methodology requires the assistance of a steering committee and an entity with the necessary fiscal modeling expertise. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to: (1) Require the office of planning and sustainable development to: (A) Develop a model to assess the fiscal impacts of land use development projects and regional infrastructure investments; and (B) Establish a fiscal sustainability steering committee to advise in the development of the model; and (2) Appropriate funds for the development of the fiscal impact model, related staffing, and to support the steering committee. SECTION 2. (a) The office of planning and sustainable development shall develop a model to assess the fiscal impacts of land use development projects and regional infrastructure investments. The office may procure consultant services, subject to the requirements of chapter 103D, Hawaii Revised Statutes, for the development and implementation of the fiscal impact model. (b) The development of the fiscal impact model shall include but not be limited to the following: (1) A model, customized for each county, that allows for the assessment of fiscal costs and benefits of individual land development projects and regional investments within the same market. The model shall be capable of capturing estimated ongoing maintenance costs and future replacement costs of infrastructure serving land development projects and any annual general costs, including public safety and administrative services. The model shall allow users to input data so that: (A) State and county fiscal revenues and costs can be mapped by land use type; (B) Fiscal productivity of various development patterns in the State can be compared at the parcel level, by land use type; (C) The value of any new development can be measured and evaluated, and measured against proposed entitlements; (D) Public policy decisions can be analyzed to reduce or eliminate taxpayer subsidies; and (E) Funding of capital improvements can be prioritized based on their anticipated return on investment; (2) Training for state and county employees in the use, methodology, and updating of the model, including developing user-tested training material, so that upon completion of the model's development, county employees can successfully use and update the model; and (3) Ensuring that the model outputs can be easily read and interpreted, with geo-referenced visual mapping, by members of the public. (c) The office of planning and sustainable development shall establish and provide support for a steering committee to advise on the development of the fiscal impact model. The steering committee shall be comprised of the following members: (1) The director of the office of planning and sustainable development, or the director's designee, who shall serve as the co-chairperson of the committee; (2) The director of finance, or the director's designee, who shall serve as the co-chairperson of the committee; (3) The director of taxation, or the department of taxation's research and planning officer; (4) The administrator of the research and economic analysis division of the department of business, economic development, and tourism, or the administrator's designee; (5) The budget and finance directors of each county, or the county directors' respective designees; and (6) The planning directors of each county, or the county directors' respective designees. (d) The office of planning and sustainable development shall submit a report on the development of the fiscal impact model to the legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the regular session of 2027. SECTION 3. There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $300,000 or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2025-2026 and the same sum or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2026-2027 for the development of the fiscal impact model pursuant to section 2 of this Act. The sums appropriated shall be expended by the office of planning and sustainable development for the purposes of this Act. SECTION 4. There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $150,000 or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2025-2026 and the same sum or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2026-2027 to hire a temporary full-time equivalent (1.0 FTE) planner (planner V equivalent), who shall be exempt from chapter 76, Hawaii Revised Statutes, to manage the fiscal impact model development project and support the work of the steering committee as required pursuant to section 2 of this Act. The sums appropriated shall be expended by the office of planning and sustainable development for the purposes of this Act. SECTION 5. This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2025.

BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII: SECTION 1. The legislature finds that patrons leaving a liquor establishment can adversely affect neighboring residents and users of nearby public facilities. The legislature enacted section 281-39.5, Hawaii Revised Statutes, which allows for the denial or restriction of liquor licenses for certain establishments near schools or parks, to promote an environment in which alcohol imbibing patrons do not interfere with minors or other residents. The legislature further finds that section 281-39.5, Hawaii Revised Statutes, currently applies only to the issuance of new liquor licenses, but not the renewal of current licenses, thus creating a safe harbor for existing establishments seeking a renewal of their liquor license. Although registered voters within five hundred feet of a liquor establishment may not be inclined to protest the initial issuance of a liquor license, they may wish to do so when the license becomes subject to renewal and they have learned more about the establishment. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to provide communities the opportunity to protest the renewal of certain liquor licenses. SECTION 2. Section 281-39.5, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (b) to read as follows: \"(b) This section shall apply [only] to both the issuance of new liquor licenses, and the renewal of existing liquor licenses, for on-site sale and consumption by the drink [and not to any renewal of such licenses].\" SECTION 3. This Act does not affect rights and duties that matured, penalties that were incurred, and proceedings that were begun before its effective date. SECTION 4. Statutory material to be repealed is bracketed and stricken. New statutory material is underscored. SECTION 5. This Act shall take effect upon its approval. Report Title: Liquor Licenses; Renewal; Protest; Denial Description: Provides that the Liquor Commission or other licensing agency of each county shall deny the renewal of certain current liquor licenses upon receipt of sufficient protests.
