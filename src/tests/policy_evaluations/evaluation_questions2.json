    "answer": "The document states that employees may purchase service credit by lump sum payment or payroll deduction.  Lump sum payments can be made by personal check or by transferring funds from a 403(b) Tax Deferred Annuity program (TDA), 403(b) Tax Shelter Annuity (TSA), or 457 Deferred Compensation Plan.  For lump sum payments from tax-sheltered funds, the employee contacts their TDA/TSA agent, provider, or 457 plan administrator for assistance and uses forms EC&B 26 (Attachment 2), Procedures for Transfer of Funds from 403(b) and 457 plans (Attachment 4), ERS Contact and Wire Instructions Sheet (Attachment 5), and Facsimile Transmittal Sheet (Attachment 6).  For payroll deduction, the employee selects the payroll method on the back of the EC&B 26 form (Attachment 3); deductions start approximately one month after ERS receives the signed documents and do not exceed 60 months.",

    "question": "What are the criteria for the Fundamental Research Exemption, and how might contractual language with government or private sponsors impact its applicability (section III.B.5.a)?",
    "answer": "The criteria for the Fundamental Research Exemption are that the research be \"basic and applied research in science and engineering at an accredited US institution of higher education, the results of which are ordinarily published and shared broadly within the scientific community.\"  It is distinguished from proprietary research or research with government access and dissemination controls.  Pre-publication review for proprietary information doesn't negate the exemption if it only causes a temporary delay.  However,  \"if research is funded by the US Government and specific national security controls or foreign policy controls are agreed upon to protect information resulting from the research, the Fundamental Research Exemption is not applicable.\"\n\nContractual language with government or private sponsors impacts applicability because the exemption is lost if the contract restricts publication (other than for identifying patentable subject matter or inadvertent disclosure of proprietary information), forbids Foreign National participation, or restricts participation in research and/or access to and disclosure of research results.  Specifically,  \"both EAR and ITAR provide that the Fundamental Research Exemption will be lost if a university or its researchers accept any government or private sponsor\u2019s contractual language that: (a) Restricts publication... (b) Forbids the participation of Foreign Nationals; or (c) Otherwise operates to restrict participation in research and/or access to and disclosure of research results...\"",
