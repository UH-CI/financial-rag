    "text": "Why CS Professionals and \nEducators Should Care about \nSpatial Skills Development\nIn the mid-2000s, the concept of brain \ntraining gained popularity, especially \namong high-achieving individuals. \nBrain training is often gamified, such \nas in Sudoku or Wordle, to encour­\nage people to practice domain-inde­\npendent cognitive skills. Advocates \nclaimed that by practicing fundamen­\ntal reasoning, memory, and problem-\nsolving skills, a person can globally \nimprove cognitive function.33 The sci­\nentific evidence, however, suggests \nthat these claims are true only locally, \nmeaning that performance improves \non only the practiced tasks.28 For ex­\nample, if people practice memoriz­\ning long lists of numbers, then they \nget better at memorizing long lists \nof numbers but at no other memory \ntasks.39 An exception to these findings \nis training in spatial reasoning skills.\nSpatial skills are those that people \nuse to reason about physical objects \nand the spatial relationships among \nthem.
