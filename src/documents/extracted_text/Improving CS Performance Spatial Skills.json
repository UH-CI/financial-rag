They associate spatial \nvisualization skill with the “construc­\ntion, manipulation, and development \nof a persistent mental model” and link \nit and other spatial skills to elements \nof program comprehension and pro­\ngram generation in CS. These ideas \nfit closely with the idea that humans \nrecruit spatial structures in the brain \nfor pseudo-spatial representations of \ncomplex, abstract ideas.29\nThe benefit of spatial training, \nthen, is to maximize processing capac­\nity in limited working memory by de­\nveloping strategies that can be applied \nto encoding and orienting any pseudo-\nspatial conceptual representations, \nsuch as those used in many STEM \nfields. In CS, for example, navigating \na code base can be equated to navigat­\ning a city, and research has found that \nCS students who are better at navigat­\ning a city are also better at navigating \na code base15 and perform better in CS \ncourses.14 Spatial encoding strategy \ntheory posits that this connection is \ndue to better strategies for processing \nallow us to rapidly encode new infor­\nmation into long-term memory while \nallowing us to recall it.

Given the robust correlation \nbetween spatial skills and STEM per­\nformance, spatial training is a com­\nmon area of research in education. In \na review of more than 200 research \nstudies about spatial training, Ut­\ntal and colleagues found that spatial \ntraining is equally effective for learn­\ners of different genders, ages, and \nlevels of initial spatial skill.40 Further, \nthe type of training they practiced had \nno effect on their outcomes. Learners \ncould practice spatial skills by playing \na game, taking a course, or practicing \nspatial tests, and their outcomes were \nsimilar. Examining types of training \nfurther, a recent study of 17,648 school­\nchildren found that practicing spatial \nencoding (that is, creating mental rep­\nresentations) was more beneficial for \nmathematics performance than prac­\nticing spatial manipulation (that is, vi­\nsualizing changes to mental represen­\ntations22). Though focused on training \na single dimension of spatial skills—\nspatial encoding—this study reified \nthe global benefit of spatial training in \nany dimension.\nToward explaining this phenom­\nenon, a group of neuroscientists found \nthe physical basis for the application \nof spatial skills training to advanced \nnonverbal cognitive skills. This group \nwon a Nobel Prize in 2014 for their dis­\ncovery that grid and place cells, primi­\ntive structures in the brain that allow \nus to navigate our physical space, are \nalso activated by navigating informa­\ntion that is non-spatial but also non­\nverbal, resulting in a sort of pseudo-\nspatial processing.5,10 Grid and place \ncells’ functions align with spatial \nencoding and orientation skills.

Given that spatial skills are \ncorrelated with success on so many \ntasks in CS, the question becomes \nwhether training spatial skills leads \nto improved outcomes. The evidence \nsuggests that training does improve \noutcomes in CS undergraduate class­\nes. Two parallel spatial skills training \nprograms at four different institutions \nboth demonstrated potential training \nbenefits.7,30 Students taking spatial \nskills training courses alongside their \nintroductory computing coursework \nperformed better than those who did \nnot participate. Even across a short, \ntwo-week computing summer school, \nin which some students were allocat­\ned to daily spatial training sessions \nand others to additional computing \nsessions, the students undertaking \nspatial skills training showed higher \nimprovements between the beginning \nand end of the course.11\nDespite reliable improvements, the \nempirical research on spatial training \nfor CS undergraduates is still limited \nand does not always demonstrate the \nsame magnitude of effect, probably \ndue to uncontrolled factors. Almost all \nspatial skills studies in CS have been \nconducted naturalistically with exist­\ning cohorts, which falls short of the re­\nsearch ideal of randomized controlled \ntrials. The strongest correlations be­\ntween spatial skills and CS have been \nobserved in students in introductory \ncomputing at a university level, partic­\nularly those with less experience. This \naligns with the spatial encoding strat­\negy theory discussed earlier, because it \nis expected that students gradually de­\nvelop their own domain-specific strat­\negies and rely less on the general strat­\negies measured by spatial skills tests.\nThere is some research, however, \nthat appears to indicate a diversion \nfrom this specific facet of spatial en­\ncoding strategy theory.

This correla­\ntion holds for students who have little \nor no programming experience when \nstarting their CS program and those \nwith STEM degrees in other fields who \nare learning CS for the first time. Spa­\ntial skills have also been associated \nwith \nmore-standardized \nmeasures \nthan course grades. One study of pre-\nuniversity CS students found a correla­\ntion between mental-rotation scores \nand scores in a subset of the Advanced \nPlacement Computer Science (AP CS A) \ntest, which can be exchanged for col­\nlege credit in the U.S.11 Researchers \nhave also found a correlation between \nspatial skills test scores and the SCS1, \na validated introductory CS assess­\nment that tests skills with which any \nstudent who completes an intro course \nshould be familiar.7\nHigher spatial skills also correlate \nwith task-specific measures of com­\nputing. Students issued a code-naviga­\ntion task20 were asked a series of ques­\ntions about a program that required \nnavigation between 1,000 lines of code \nspread across six files. Students were \ninstructed to click each line of code \nas they read it, and the screen was re­\ncorded to capture the students’ pro­\ncess. The researchers determined that \nmoving the cursor by more than 10 \nlines of code qualified as an intra-class \njump, while clicking between files was \nconsidered an inter-class jump. The \ncount of both kinds of jumps showed \na significant positive correlation with \nspatial skills, indicating that students \nwith higher spatial skills jumped \nbetween areas of the code more fre­\nquently. Students with higher spatial \nskills also took less time to complete \nthe exercise. Further, in a study in­\nvolving introductory CS students,32 an \nexpression-evaluation test was devel­\noped consisting of 30 multiple-choice \nitems of increasing difficulty. The test \nused only simple Python expressions \nand data structures, which all the stu­\ndents were tested to be familiar with \nin isolation, and combined them in \nincreasingly complex sequences.
