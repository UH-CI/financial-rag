Boone Kauffman2\nUSDA Forest Service Institute of Paciﬁc Islands Forestry, 60 Nowelo St., Hilo, Hawaii 96720, U.S.A.\nABSTRACT\nInvasive species interacting with ﬁres pose a relatively unknown, but potentially serious, threat to the tropical forests of Hawaii. Fires may create conditions that\nfacilitate species invasions, but the degree to which this occurs in different tropical plant communities has not been quantiﬁed. We documented the survival and\nestablishment of plant species for 2 yr following 2003 wildﬁres in tropical moist and wet forest life zones in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, Hawaii. Fires were ignited\nby lava ﬂows and burned across a steep environmental gradient encompassing two previously burned shrub-dominated communities and three Metrosideros polymorpha\nforest communities. Fires in all community types were stand replacing, where 495 percent of overstory trees were top killed. Over half (457%) of the trees survived\nvia basal sprouting, but sprout growth differed among forest communities. Sprout growth (4250,000 cm3) was greatest in the forest community where postﬁre\nunderstory cover was lowest presumably due to thick native Dicranopteris linearis fern litter that remained postﬁre. In contrast, M. polymorpha sprout growth was\nmuch slower (o100,000 cm3) in the two forest communities where there was rapid understory recovery of nonnative ferns Nephrolepis multiﬂora and invasive grasses\nPaspalum conjugatum. These results suggest that the rapid establishment of an invasive-dominated understory limited recovery of the overstory dominant M.\npolymorpha. In contrast to the three forest communities, there were few changes in vegetation composition in the shrubland communities. Nonnative species invasions\ncoupled with repeated ﬁres selectively eliminated ﬁre-sensitive species thereby maintaining these communities in dominance of primarily nonnative, ﬁre-resilient,\nspecies.\nKey words: disturbance; invasive species; Metrosideros polymorpha; sprouting; tropical forest.\nCHANGES IN BIODIVERSITY ASSOCIATED WITH BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS OF\nnonnative species are a tremendous concern at local, regional, and\nglobal scales (Vitousek et al. 1996). Nonnative or ‘alien species’ are\nspecies capable of propagating that are not native to that ecosystem\n(Presidental Documents 1999). In ecosystems where alien species\npersist ‘naturalized species’ may be applied to those that are wide-\nspread and capable of reproducing frequently (Richardson et al.\n2000). If nonnative or naturalized species are likely to cause eco-\nnomic or environmental harm they are considered ‘invasive species’\n(Presidental Documents 1999). Invasive species are a serious threat\nto native ecosystems because of their capacity to dramatically alter\nspecies composition, ecosystem function, and successional trajecto-\nries (D’Antonio & Vitousek 1992). Moreover, global climate\nchange and altered disturbance regimes are predicted to allow range\nexpansion of many invasive species (Kriticos et al. 2003a, b; Mor-\nrison et al. 2005). These stresses to native ecosystems will likely\nincrease the capacity of some naturalized species to dominate\nplant communities such that they will become invasive (Dukes &\nMooney 1999, Asner et al. 2006). To improve our understanding\nof invasion ecology and make future predictions it is essential to\nexamine both the susceptibility of native communities to invasion\nand determine the potentials of invasiveness and naturalization\nof alien species (Richardson & Pysek 2006). Studies of potential\nresponses of alien species are particularly needed in geographical\nregions previously underrepresented such as oceanic islands (Crall\net al. 2006, Pysek et al. 2008).\nNatural disturbances, a major source of heterogeneity in the\nstructure and dynamics of all natural communities (Sousa 1984),\nhave been documented to facilitate nonnative species invasions in\nmany community types across the globe (Hobbs & Huenneke\n1992, D’Antonio & Dudley 1995, Kitayama & Mueller-Dombois\n1995, Burke & Grime 1996, Aplet et al. 1998, Bellingham et al.\n2005, De Gruchy et al. 2005). According to the ﬂuctuating-\nresources hypothesis, community invasibility increases with in-\ncreases in available resources (Davis et al. 2000). Fire can increase\navailable resources at a site by consuming or reducing predistur-\nbance vegetation (Grime 1979) and increasing nutrient availability\n(Kauffman 1990) thereby decreasing resource use (Davis et al.\n2000) and altering microsite conditions (e.g., light levels, wind\nspeed, and moisture availability). In the Hawaiian Islands, nonna-\ntive species have been shown to invade sites following disturbances\nand the concomitant increases in resource availability (Gerrish\n& Mueller-Dombois 1980, Carino & Daehler 2002, Ostertag &\nReceived 14 August 2009; revision accepted 3 February 2010.\n1Corresponding author; current address: Inventory and Monitoring Paciﬁc\nIsland Network, PO Box 52, Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, Hawaii 96718,\nU.S.A.; e-mail: alison_ainsworth@nps.gov\n2Current address: Climate, Fire and Carbon Sciences, USDA Forest Service,\nNorthern Research Station, 271 Mast Road, Durham, New Hampshire 03824,\nU.S.A.\nBIOTROPICA 42(6): 647–655 2010\n10.1111/j.1744-7429.2010.00636.x\nr 2010 The Author(s)\n647\nJournal compilation r 2010 by The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation\n",

No studies have addressed the fundamental\necological issue of community invasibility by examining differences\nin invasibility among multiple plant communities subjected to the\nsame disturbance or series of disturbance events.\nThe interactive effects of nonnative species and ﬁre are not well\nunderstood in many ecosystems (Brooks et al. 2004), particularly in\nthe tropics (Cochrane 2003). Species composition can inﬂuence\nboth the magnitude of a disturbance and species survival following\ndisturbance. In addition, Mack and D’Antonio (1998) suggested\nthat invasive species can alter disturbance regimes (e.g., enhancing\nor suppressing ﬁre, increasing or decreasing erosion) and, thereby,\nsuccessional trajectories of the plant communities. For example,\nnonnative grass invasions in the seasonally dry woodlands of Ha-\nwaii alter biomass and fuel composition, structure, moisture, and\nchemistry, increasing the probability of an increased frequency and\nseverity of ﬁre (D’Antonio & Vitousek 1992).\nThe nonnative fern Nephrolepis multiﬂora was not abundant in\nthe East Rift portion of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park until\nsometime after the 1980s (Jacobi 1989). Following a lava-ignited\nwildﬁre in 2002 in this region, N. multiﬂora recovered rapidly from\nsprouts, consistent with observations in the Caribbean (Rivera et al.\n2000). To what extent the presence of this recent invasion as well as\nrange expansions of invasive grasses such as Paspalum conjugatum in\nthe mesic and wet forest communities of Hawaii (Pratt et al. 1999)\nmay inﬂuence native forest regeneration is unknown.\nThe objectives of this study were to compare changes in veg-\netation composition and structure for 2 yr following lava-ignited\nwildﬁres in ﬁve plant communities arrayed across an environmental\ngradient of four life zones (Tosi et al. 2001), and comprising a veg-\netation gradient from shrubland to wet forest. We hypothesized\nthat postﬁre succession of these communities would differ and that\nnonnative species would alter native plant community succession.\nSpeciﬁcally, ﬁre would facilitate species invasions and where non-\nnative species were abundant following ﬁre they would limit native\nspecies recovery. We predicted that: (1) communities dominated by\nnatives before ﬁre would have higher nonnative species abundance\nin burned sites compared with unburned sites (i.e., ﬁre would in-\ncrease invasibility by nonnative species), and (2) communities dom-\ninated by nonnatives before ﬁre would not differ in vegetation\ncomposition and structure between burned and unburned sites (i.e.,\nﬁre would not increase invasibility by a different suite of nonnative\nspecies). In addition, we predicted that communities where nonna-\ntive species were abundant during early postﬁre succession would\nexhibit: (3) faster understory recovery (i.e., fewer differences in\npostﬁre composition and cover), (4) lower native tree species\nrecruitment, and (5) slower recovery rates for surviving trees.\nMETHODS\nSTUDY SITE.—The study site is located within Hawaii Volcanoes\nNational Park (1912001100 N, 155172900 W) on the east slope of\nKilauea volcano at 350–825 m elevation on the Island of Hawaii\n(Fig. 1). Precipitation varies across this steep gradient from dry\nshrublands to wet forest. Substrate consists of young (400–750 yr-\nold) pahoehoe lava ﬂows (Trusdell et al. 2005) overlain by shallow\n(5–50 cm)\nsoils\nderived\nfrom\nvolcanic\nash\n(Kalapana\nand\nMakaopuhi series; Jasper 2007). Detailed site descriptions are pro-\nvided in Ainsworth and Kauffman (2009).\nCommunity response to ﬁre was examined in ﬁve communi-\nties across the elevation gradient (Table 1). Communities share a\nsingle dominant forest tree species, Metrosideros polymorpha, but\nvary widely in tree density and percent canopy cover (o1% shrub-\nlands to 460% mesic forests). The two lowest elevation commu-\nnities (Andropogon and Nephrolepis shrublands) have been disturbed\nby past human-ignited ﬁres and at the time of the study only con-\ntained remnant M. polymorpha trees restricted to rock outcrops.\nHistoric photos of this region suggest that these communities were\nM. polymorpha woodlands with scattered shrubs and a mixed un-\nderstory before 1972 (Hawaii Department of Land and Natural\nResources\n1966).\nToday,\nnative\nDodonaea\nviscosa\nshrubs\n(8500–9000 individuals/ha) dominate these communities. Under-\nstory differs with nonnative perennial bunch grasses (Andropogon\nvirginicus) at 350–450 m in the ‘Andropogon shrubland’ and non-\nnative N. multiﬂora ferns at 450–550 m in ‘Nephrolepis shrubland.’\nThe three forest communities (Nephrolepis, Dicranopteris, and\nCibotium forests) have canopies dominated by M. polymorpha\n(500–800/ha) and no known history of ﬁre disturbance. The low-\nest elevation forest occurring at 550–640 m is ecotonal to the Ne-\nphrolepis shrubland and is dominated by nonnative N. multiﬂora\nferns in the understory. The Dicranopteris forest (640–750 m) is\ndominated by native mat-forming ferns (Dicranopteris linearis) in\nthe understory. The highest elevation and wettest community sam-\npled has an open canopy of M. polymorpha, abundant native tree\nferns Cibotium glaucum in the midstory, and native ferns and non-\nnative grasses in the understory.\nVolcanic lava ﬂows have been the primary ignition source for\nwildland ﬁres in this area of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park since\nat least 1916 (Gassaway et al. 2002). Multiple ﬁres have occurred in\nthe coastal lowlands over the last 30 yr and two have burned the\nshrubland communities of this study area. In 2002, a new lava out-\nbreak ignited the Kupukupu Fire that burned 1400 ha of forest.\nNine months later the Panau Iki Fire (January 2003) burned\n860 ha of Andropogon and Nephrolepis shrublands. In May 2003,\nthe Luhi Fire burned 2000 ha across the study area (National Park\nService 2003). We sampled vegetation composition and structure\nin permanent plots (N = 5) in each of the ﬁve vegetation commu-\nnities in areas burned in the 2003 Panau Iki and Luhi wildﬁres and\nunburned controls.\nVEGETATION SAMPLING.—We examined ecological effects of wildﬁre\nthrough comparisons of the vegetation composition and structure\nin the areas burned by the 2003 wildﬁres, and adjacent unburned\nsites.

Differences in\nM. polymorpha sprout volume among forested communities were\nanalyzed using ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparison tests. To\ndetermine the effect of ﬁre in each community separately, differ-\nences in many vegetation parameters (species richness, nonnative\ncomposition, species diversity, and understory cover) were com-\npared between sites and years following ﬁre using two sample t-tests\n(unburned vs. burned 1-yr postﬁre and unburned vs. burned 2-yr\npostﬁre). Nonparametric tests (Wilcoxon rank test) were used to\ncompare differences in understory cover (shrublands and Dicranop-\nteris forest) and species diversity (Dicranopteris forest). ANOVA\nand t-test analyses were performed at an a = 0.1 to increase the\npower (1 \u0003 b) Multivariate statistical analysis of community data\nwas based on cover values for all herbaceous and shrub species\n(McCune & Mefford 1999). Nonmetric multidimensional scaling\n(NMS) ordination was used to delineate patterns between burned\nand unburned sites and among communities (Kruskal 1964, Mat-\nher 1976). Additional test details are available in Ainsworth (2007).\nRESULTS\nWhile the wildland ﬁres were stand replacing in all ﬁve communi-\nties, over half (57%) of the M. polymorpha survived ﬁre through\nbasal sprouting (Ainsworth & Kauffman 2009). The rates of sprout\ngrowth of M. polymorpha, however, differed among communities\nand by the second year postﬁre sprout volume was greater in the\nDicranopteris forest than the other communities (Fig. 2).\nThere were dramatic differences in vegetation response to ﬁre\namong the sampled plant communities. One hundred and eight\nspecies were found across the gradient, 14 trees, 3 tree ferns, 23\nshrubs, 6 vines, 15 ferns, and 47 herbs, grasses, and sedges. Over\nhalf (56%) of these species were native. Species richness and the\nproportion of those species that were nonnative differed between\nunburned and burned sites (P o 0.01), as well as among commu-\nnities (P o 0.01). In the forest communities, species richness and\nthe proportion of those species that were nonnative were signiﬁ-\ncantly greater in the burned sites than the unburned sites. For both\nparameters the interaction term was also signiﬁcant (P o 0.01),\nclearly reﬂecting the different postﬁre responses of the plant com-\nmunities (Figs. 3 and 4).\nResults of the NMS analysis of the understory for all commu-\nnities combined indicated that community type was more impor-\ntant in explaining differences in community composition than the\neffects of ﬁre (Fig. 3A). The sample units for the ﬁve communities\nseparated into forest and shrubland communities along Axis 2,\nwhich explained a greater percentage of the variation in the data\n(25%) than the burn Axis 1 (20%) even after rotation that maxi-\nmized the alignment of the burn variable with Axis 1. In addition,\nheterogeneity among plots within each community type differed, as\nindicated by the difference in polygon size (Fig. 3B). The Dicra-\nnopteris and Cibotium forests, in particular, exhibited much more\nvariation in understory species composition than the Nephrolepis\nforest or the nonnative-dominated shrublands demonstrating that\nthe dominance by nonnatives lower community heterogeneity and\nhence landscape biodiversity (Fig. 3B). The understory composi-\ntion in the burned forest communities more closely resembled the\ncomposition in the shrubland communities. To separate the effects\nof ﬁre from the effects of community type, we analyzed the vege-\ntation data for each community separately.\nANDROPOGON\nSHRUBLAND.—Over half (65%) of the 19 species\nfound in the unburned site were nonnative including invasive Lant-\nana camara and Psidium guajava. Nonnative A. virginicus and na-\ntive D. viscosa were most abundant and together constituted 490\npercent of the total understory vegetation cover (Table S1) contrib-\nuting to low species diversity (H0 = 0.340) and evenness (J0 = 0.31).\nIn the burned site 2-yr postﬁre, 22 species were found (57% non-\nnative). Vegetation recolonized quickly following ﬁre such that\ncombined cover 1-yr postﬁre did not differ from the unburned site\n(P = 0.69; Fig. 4).

In the burned site 2-yr postﬁre, 48 species (446% non-\nnative) were found with increased diversity (0.592; P = 0.01) and\nevenness (0.39). Total understory vegetation cover was far lower in\nthe burned site both 1-yr (o1%; P = 0.01) and 2-yr (26%;\nP o 0.01) postﬁre (Figs. 4A and B).

Invasive P. conjugatum had higher relative cover\n(12%) following ﬁre than in the unburned site (o2%) and two\npotentially invasive species colonized the postﬁre environment\n(Rubus rosifolius and Axonopus ﬁssifolius). The nonnative vine Passi-\nﬂora edulis was the most abundant species (11% cover).\nCIBOTIUM FOREST.—Species richness was the highest of all unburned\nsampled communities with a total of 35 species encountered (10%\nnonnative). Species diversity (0.218) and evenness (0.16) were also\nhigher than the other forest communities. Total understory cover\nwas relatively sparse with a combined cover value of 26 percent;\nD. linearis is the most abundant species (Table S1). In the burned\nplots, the number of species found (57) 2-yr postﬁre was 63 percent\ngreater than in the unburned plots and 40 percent were nonnative.\nDespite increased richness, understory diversity (0.292) was similar\nto the unburned site. Total understory cover was greater in the\nburned plots 1-yr (44%; P = 0.28) and 2-yr (87%; P o 0.01) post-\nﬁre than the unburned plots (Figs. 4A and B) largely due to the\ndramatic expansion of the invasive grass P. conjugatum (Table S1).\nThis grass was the most abundant species following ﬁre with 73\npercent cover as compared with 2 percent in the unburned plots.\nSimilarly, N. multiﬂora had o1 percent cover in the unburned\nplots, but was the second most abundant species (6% cover) in the\nburned plots. Two potentially invasive shrubs (Buddleia asiatica\nand R. rosifolius) colonized the postﬁre environment.\nDISCUSSION\nCOMMUNITY INVASIBILITY.—The stand-replacement ﬁre converted\nthree tropical wet forest communities into early seral herbaceous-\ndominated communities. The ﬁres likely increased resource avail-\nability (sunlight, water availability, and nutrients) thereby creating\nopportunities for recruitment of a different suite of both native and\nnonnative species. As predicted, the communities dominated by\nnatives before ﬁre had higher nonnative species abundance in\nburned sites compared with unburned sites. These results support\nthe ﬂuctuating-resources hypothesis, in that community invasibility\nincreased for the forest communities with increases in available re-\nsources. Before ﬁre, native D. linearis was the most abundant un-\nderstory species in the two native forest communities, but was\nvirtually absent during early postﬁre succession. The effect of ﬁre on\nD. linearis has been shown to differ ranging from rapid regrowth\nfrom living tissue in Sri Lanka (Maheswaran & Gunatilleke 1988,\nAshton et al. 2001), to slow (410 yr) recovery from expanding un-\nburned patches in Hawaii (Tunison et al. 2001), and even no re-\ngeneration following ﬁre and other disturbances (Holttum 1957,\nWalker & Boneta 1995). Dicranopteris linearis recovery in this\nstudy is likely to be slow because ﬁres completely killed fern indi-\nviduals and few patches were left unburned from which to recolo-\nnize. Slow recovery is of particular concern because the order of\narrival following disturbance can dictate which species dominate a\nsite (Connell & Slatyer 1977).\nIn contrast to the forest communities, ﬁre had little effect on\nthe structure and composition of the shrubland. Fire did not in-\ncrease invasibility in these communities. Differences in invasibility\namong communities in this study were inversely related to the ‘level\nof invasion’ or abundance of nonnative species in each community\nbefore ﬁre. These results emphasize the importance of community\ncomposition before disturbance when predicting vulnerability to\ninvasion by new species. Previous theories that focused on native\nspecies richness as a proxy for community invasibility (e.g., Elton’s\nbiotic resistance hypothesis, 1958) as opposed to community com-\nposition are likely to be less applicable as nonnative species become\nincreasingly abundant on a global scale. Species identity, particu-\nlarly disturbance adaptations in this study, as well as abundance are\nlikely to be important indicators of invasibility. For example, the\nshrubland communities are likely less vulnerable to new species in-\nvasions because they have previously burned and the species now\ndominant are adapted to shorter ﬁre-return intervals (Kauffman\n1990). Even in previously invaded communities or completely\nnovel habitats, invasibility is important because not all invasive spe-\ncies are equal in their economic or environmental impacts.\nDO NONNATIVE SPECIES INHIBIT NATIVE SPECIES RECOVERY?—Invasive\nspecies may alter ecosystem responses to ﬁre (Mack & D’Antonio\n1998). Four of the ﬁve communities sampled were dominated by\nnonnative species during early postﬁre succession. Site dominance\noccurred through two pathways: (1) rapid recovery of nonnative\ngrasses and ferns where they dominated before ﬁre (e.g., Andropogon\nshrubland, Nephrolepis shrubland, and Nephrolepis forest), and (2)\ncolonization and range expansion of the invasive grass P. con-\njugatum into previously native-dominated sites (e.g., Cibotium for-\nest). The rapid recover of nonnative grasses and ferns where they\ndominated before ﬁre were expected, but the extent of P. con-\njugatum expansion in the Cibotium forest was not. Paspalum con-\njugatum was present in the unburned plots and was recorded in\nthese forests in the late 1980s (Pratt et al. 1999), but with lower\nrelative cover. Fire appeared to temporarily decrease barriers to un-\nderstory colonization through increased light availability (Burton &\nMueller-Dombois 1984) due to canopy and subcanopy mortality\n(Ainsworth & Kauffman 2009) and by consuming the slow to de-\ncompose dense frond litter layer (Russell & Vitousek 1997) thus\naltering seedbed conditions for a rapid establishment of invasive\nP. conjugatum grass in the understory.\nPhysical site dominance by nonnative herbaceous understory\nspecies can limit available space for slower-growing native species to\nestablish (D’Antonio & Vitousek 1992, Aide et al. 1995, Cabin\net al. 2000, Corbin & D’Antonio 2004). Despite large differences\nin understory cover following ﬁre among communities, native\nwoody seedling densities did not differ among the three forest com-\nmunities (Ainsworth & Kauffman 2009). Presumably the rapid\nrecovery of nonnative N. multiﬂora and colonization of grasses\nfollowing ﬁre inhibited seedling establishment. Alternatively,\n652\nAinsworth and Kauffman\n",

    "pymupdf_extraction_text": "regrowth of D. linearis was virtually absent and the thick litter layer\nthat was not consumed by the ﬁre in this community appeared to\ndiminish seedling establishment of all species following ﬁre. The\nremaining fuel, primarily a dense litter mat of D. linearis, was slow\nto decompose and may affect forest regeneration by limiting light\nand space on the forest ﬂoor (Maheswaran & Gunatilleke 1988,\nRussell & Vitousek 1997). Seedling germination was inversely pro-\nportional to D. linearis litter depth in a decomposition experiment\nin Hawaii (Follet et al. 2003). In this study, invading nonnative or\nnative species may gain dominance in the understory of the\nDicranopteris forest community as the remnant litter layer gradu-\nally decomposes. It is also possible, however, that D. linearis ferns\nmay regain dominance over time.\nMetrosideros polymorpha sprout growth was greatest in the na-\ntive Dicranopteris forest, where understory competition was much\nlower than the other two forest communities where postﬁre under-\nstories were dominated by nonnative species. These results suggest\nthat the rapid establishment of a nonnative-dominated understory\ndecreases the growth of M. polymorpha sprouts. Similar results were\nfound in dry woodland sites in Hawaii, where nonnative grasses\ncompeted for light with native shrub seedlings (Hughes et al. 1991,\nHughes & Vitousek 1993). At this site, grass removal resulted in a\nstrong growth response by M. polymorpha and native shrubs with\nincreases in seedling recruitment (D’Antonio et al. 1998, Mack &\nD’Antonio 2003). In this study, the dominance of N. multiﬂora to\nthe exclusion of other species (Fig. 4B) suggests that this nonnative\nfern may be altering the successional trajectory of these mesic and\nwet forests and should be considered an invasive species in Hawaii.\nIMPLICATIONS OF FIRE AND NONNATIVE SPECIES INVASIONS.—In the\ntwo lowest elevation shrubland communities, the combination of\nnonnative species (plants and ungulates), coupled with ignitions\nhave created an alien species–ﬁre cycle (D’Antonio & Vitousek\n1992) resulting in the loss of native M. polymorpha woodlands. The\nconspicuous lack of trees and shrubs except for D. viscosa in the un-\nburned shrubland sites where ﬁre has not occurred in over 10 yr\nsuggests that postﬁre site dominance by these grasses and ferns will\npersist for many years.\nIn the mesic forest communities (Nephrolepis and Dicranop-\nteris forests) over half of the M. polymorpha canopy trees initially\nsurvived ﬁre by sprouting, but mortality increased between the ﬁrst\nand second postﬁre years (Ainsworth 2007). Because of the open\nnature of these sites coupled with a continuous herbaceous cover or\nlitter layer additional ﬁres are possible. The occurrence of another\nﬁre could convert these forests to communities dominated by non-\nnative herbs and shrubs more closely resembling the adjacent shrub-\nland communities.\nFire is a rare occurrence in tropical wet forests that comprise\nthe Cibotium community. Following ﬁre nonnative species ex-\npanded their range. The long-term persistence and impact of inva-\nsive P. conjugatum grass in the understory are unknown. Unlike the\nlower elevation mesic forests, C. glaucum dominated the subcanopy\nand over 90 percent survived the ﬁre (Ainsworth & Kauffman\n2009). Therefore, much of the frond canopy reestablished within a\nyear decreasing light and nutrient availability to the understory.\nTree ferns were observed to create suitable sites of seedling estab-\nlishment of M. polymorpha, but the rapid recovery of the fern can-\nopy may slow their growth into canopy dominance (Burton &\nMueller-Dombois 1984). Similar to the Dicranopteris forest com-\nmunity, the occurrence of additional ﬁres would likely result in in-\ncreased nonnative species abundance and loss of native forest\ncomponents. Although currently these cooler, wetter, and higher\nelevation forests (Giambelluca et al. 1986) are less likely to be\nreadily type converted into nonnative-dominated shrubland com-\nmunities, this is a possible scenario with global change creating\nconditions for increased ﬁre frequencies.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nFunding for this study came from the National Joint Fire Science\nProgram.
