(For purposes of this administrative procedure, non-UH entities include groups and organizations which may be affiliated to the University of Hawai‘i for other purposes such as fund raising, and any other entities which are not under the authority and control of the Board of Regents of the University of Hawai‘i.) Executive Policy EP 8.110 further delegates authority to Chancellor to execute contractual documents relating to such ticket sales which require payments of amounts less than $25,000.  B.  Procedure: Any event conducted by UH Mānoa Athletics or for which tickets are sold using the UH Mānoa Athletics ticket system which (1) is not a University of Hawai‘i athletic competition and (2) which requires or may result in a payment to a non-UH entity shall require a written agreement with the non-UH entity regarding the rights to and disposition of proceeds of ticket sales.    Such agreement shall not allow payments from proceeds of the ticket sales to be made to non-UH entities until after the event has been conducted, and then only after all costs incurred by the University of Hawai‘i (including ticketing and transactional fees) have been recovered and any facilities use fees, rentals and other fees agreed upon and owing to the University of Hawai‘i have been received by the University.  In addition, payments shall not be made to an entity who is not a party to the agreement, except in the case of donations received in conjunction with ticket sales using the University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa Athletics ticket system. Such donations may be paid to the University of Hawai‘i Foundation.    The agreement must be approved by the Athletics Director and the Chancellor with a copy of such approval being sent to the President.  Agreements under this procedure which require or may result in a payment to a non-UH entity of $25,000 or more may only be executed by the President or designee.

No ticket sales may commence until and unless such an agreement has been executed, and then only in accordance with such agreement and upon approval by the Athletics Director, which approval shall be an indication that all necessary requirements of the agreement have been complied with prior to such sales.      Exceptions to this procedure may be made only with approval of the Athletics Director, the Chancellor and the President.",

This administrative procedure promulgates the guidelines for determining the amounts of administrative stipends which may be paid to department chairs, special program directors, and chairs of academic subdivisions.   \n\nII.  Applicability/Responsibility  This instruction applies to all faculty personnel throughout the University of Hawai‘i system. Vice Presidents, Chancellors, and the Provost are responsible for ensuring internal equity and consistency with respect to the application of these guidelines.   \n\nIII.  Guidelines \n                            1.

Purpose  A.  To establish guidelines and procedures for the uniform application of facilities and administrative (F&A) cost rates in proposals and awarded projects; for securing waivers from approved F&A cost rates; and applying F&A cost rates to multi-year grants and contracts, continuation funding and supplemental funding.    \nII. Definitions  No policy specific or unique definitions apply    \nIII. Administrative Procedure  A.    Applicability   \n  \nThese guidelines and procedures shall apply to all extramurally funded projects.  \n  \nB.    Guidelines   \n  \nThe following guidelines shall be followed to ensure the consistent treatment and inclusion of appropriate facilities and administrative cost rates in contract or grant proposals and awarded projects.  \n  \n1.    Unless facilities and administrative cost recovery is limited or prohibited by statute, regulation, or approved by Federal awarding agency head and communicated to the Office of Management and Budget, proposal budgets shall provide for full recovery of F&A costs via the most current rate identified under the College and Universities Rate Agreement between the University and the US Department of Health and Human Services Cost Allocation Services that is appropriate for the proposed program or activity (also known as function) and location.  \n  \na.    F&A costs are classified under one of three major functions:  \n  \n(1)    Sponsored research – Systematic study directed toward increasing scientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied. Includes development, which uses the knowledge gained through research toward the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or methods. Also includes research training, where the training activity occurs in or uses the same facilities as research projects (e.g., K, F32, and T32 awards).  \n  \n(a)    Special research rates have been developed for research programs or activities as follows:  \n  \n(i)    Applied Research Laboratory at the University of Hawaii (ARL at UH). For research programs or activities conducted by the ARL at UH.  \n  \n(ii)    Kaka‘ako Research. For research programs or activities performed or conducted on the Kaka‘ako Campus.   \n  \n  \n(2)    Sponsored instruction – All teaching and training activities established by grant, contract, or cooperative agreement. Includes curriculum development; special student services established by grant, contract, or cooperative agreement; and service learning projects where students receive academic credit.  \n  \n(3)    Other sponsored activities – Activities that involve the performance of work other than research or training. For example, performances and exhibitions; workshops and conferences; evaluations; and operation of clinics, extension services, and small business development centers. Other sponsored activities also include clinical trials performed for pharmaceutical companies.  \n  \nb.    On- or off-campus rates are applied in accordance with the following guidelines:  \n  \n(1)    On-campus rates shall be used when programs or activities are predominantly performed or conducted by University personnel, including project staff hired through RCUH, in facilities that are operated and maintained by the University. On-campus rates apply regardless of whether facilities support is provided by the campus or by the schools, research units, or departments.  \n  \n(a)    A list of on-campus sites is provided in Attachment 1.  \n  \n(2)    Off-campus rates shall be used when programs or activities are predominantly performed or conducted by University personnel in facilities provided by the sponsor (either at no cost or paid for by the grant or contract) or a third party, or in the field.  \n  \n(3)    Predominance shall mean that more than 50% of the work is performed or conducted at the location.  \n  \n(4)    In determining whether a program or activity occurs on-campus or off-campus, the work of subawardees shall not be considered. This is because the F&A cost rates apply to University activity and where it is performed or conducted.  \n  \nc.    Rate agreement calculation base  \n  \n(1)    The rate agreement calculation base is modified total direct costs (MTDC).  \n  \n(2)    MTDC consists of all salaries and wages, fringe benefits, materials and supplies, services, travel, and the first $25,000 of each subaward (regardless of the period covered by the subaward). MTDC excludes equipment, capital expenditures, charges for patient care, tuition remission, rental costs of off-site facilities, scholarships and fellowships, participant support costs, the portion of each subaward in excess of $25,000, and specialized service facility charges.  \n  \n(3)    Subaward refers to the programmatic work under a grant or contract. It does not refer to contracts for goods or services, which are subject to full F&A costs.  \n  \n(4)    Specialized service facility (SSF) charges refer to charges from the following SSF's: IFA Job Order Services, IFA Mauna Kea Midlevel Facility, SOEST Computing Facility, SOEST Engineering Facility, and SOEST Ship Operations.  \n  \nd.    Waivers  \n  \nExcept for sponsor limitations or prohibitions on F&A costs that can be verified through the web (e.g., such as through a US Office of Management & Budget listing of Federal sponsor F&A rate deviations), any waiver from the most current rates on the Colleges and Universities Rate Agreement shall require the written approval (either in memo or email format) of the respective campus Chancellor or designee.  \n  \n2.    Awards of Multi-Year Grants or Multi-Year Contracts  \n  \na.    Multi-Year Grants. In accordance with OMB Circular A-21 and 2 CFR 200 Appendix III, the F&A cost rates in effect at the time an award is made shall be used throughout the life of the award.  \n  \nb.    Multi-Year Contracts. Where the FAR clause at 52.216-15 is incorporated into the contract, the predetermined F&A cost rates in effect for the fiscal period in which costs are incurred shall apply.  \n  \n3.    Continuation Funding.  \n  \na.    For grants or contracts that will be extended without competition, the F&A cost rates in effect at the time the original award was made shall be used in proposals for continuation funding.  \n  \nb.    For grants and contracts that will be subject to competition, the most current F&A cost rates shall be used in proposals for continuation funding.  \n  \n4.    Supplemental Funding. Unless sponsor policies state otherwise, supplemental funding will be considered new funding. Thus, the most current F&A cost rates shall be used in proposals for supplemental funding.  \n  \nC.    Procedures  \n  \nPrincipal Investigators (PI) or Project Directors (PD), with the assistance of the Fiscal Administrator (FA), shall budget for full recovery of F&A costs in proposals by using the most current rates in the Colleges and Universities Rate Agreement subject to the following:   \n  \n1.    Limitation or prohibition on facilities and administrative cost rates. The Principal Investigator should provide copies of or a web address for the applicable statute, regulation, policy statement, or request for proposal that identifies the F&A cost rate limitation or prohibition along with the myGRANT Proposal Development record when the proposal is submitted to the Office of Research Services as support.  \n  \na.    Letters from the sponsor that do not reference applicable statutes, regulations, or policy statements that can be verified through the web are not acceptable. Such letters should be considered requests for waivers and submitted to the appropriate campus Chancellor or designee for review and approval.  \n  \n2.    Waivers of facilities and administrative cost rates.   \n  \na.    The PI/PD should determine well in advance whether a F&A waiver should be obtained for the proposal. Should the PI/PD determine that this is the case, the PI/PD should draft a memo or email request for waiver to the respective campus Chancellor or designee. The format may vary from campus to campus, but should be via the respective Dean/Director and include the amount of the waiver, the reason for the request, the benefit to be derived by the University as a result of the waiver, and the ramifications if the approval is not granted. A copy of the approved waiver request should be included with the myGRANT Proposal Development record when the proposal is submitted to the Office of Research Services as support.  \n  \nb.    For federally funded grants and contracts either received directly by UH or via a pass-through entity that are not subject to F&A rate limitations/prohibitions or do not have a prior approved UH F&A waiver, UH expects to receive F&A costs based on the current F&A rates in effect at the time the award is made per OMB Circular A-21 and 2 CFR 200 Appendix III.  The PI/PD with the assistance of the FA should re-budget to accommodate the current F&A rates.  The PI/PD may request a waiver from the respective campus Chancellor or designee at the time of award to avoid re-budgeting.  \n  \n3.    Tracking of Unrecovered Indirect Costs. Whenever a sponsor limitation on F&A costs is accepted or waiver of F&A costs is made, the amount of unrecovered indirect costs shall be tracked in myGRANT in accordance with the myGRANT general instructions. Unrecovered indirect costs is the difference between the amount the University could have recovered if it was allowed to charge its applicable federally negotiated F&A rate and the amount actually budgeted for F&A in the proposal.  \n  \n4.    The Office of Research Services may issue instructions on how to handle F&A rates when awards are made during a transition from an old F&A rate agreement to a new F&A rate agreement.    \nIV. Delegation of Authority  There is no administrative procedure specific delegation of authority.    \nV. Contact Information  Office of the Vice President for Research and Innovation, telephone number: (808) 956-4740; and email [lgouveia@hawaii.edu](mailto:lgouveia@hawaii.edu?subject=8.927) may be contacted for information   \nrelating to this Administrative Procedure.    \nVI.

Purpose  A.  To ensure that all administrative and financial management requirements for extramural contracts and grants are understood and complied with by all appropriate UH personnel. Special emphasis is placed on full compliance with applicable federal requirements which is mandatory.    \nII. Definitions  No policy specific or unique definitions apply    \nIII. Administrative Procedure  A.    Objectives  \n  \nTo establish guidelines and procedures which prescribe the administrative and financial management requirements for extramurally financed programs and activities, to delineate fiscal and administrative responsibilities and functions within the UH, and to provide reasonable assurance that sponsored programs and activities are managed in strict compliance with the terms and conditions specified under award agreements.  \n  \nB.    Applicability  \n  \nThese guidelines and procedures shall apply to all sponsored agreements including those projects that have been service ordered to the Research Corporation of the University of Hawai‘i (RCUH) (see AP A8.930, “Service Orders to the RCUH”), and subawards and agreements with nonfederal sponsors that are financed directly from \"flowdown\" federal sources.  \n  \nAll sponsored agreements shall be administered at all times in strict compliance with federal laws, state statutes, UH policies and procedures, and the specific terms and conditions of a contract or grant award. If any federal statute expressly prescribes requirements that differ from those provided herein, the provisions of the statute shall govern.  \n  \nC.    The Essential Federal Requirements  \n  \nFor new awards issued on or after December 26, 2014 and for increments to existing awards issued on or after December 26, 2014, if the Federal awarding agency modifies the terms and conditions or does not specifically reference the OMB Circulars:  \n  \n1.    2 CFR 200.  This final guidance supersedes and streamlines requirements from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circulars A-21, A-110 and A-133.  See http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title02/2cfr200_main_02.tpl for the complete text of this guidance.  \n    \nFor existing awards received prior to December 26, 2014 that do not receive incremental funding with new terms and conditions or sponsor prohibits application of 2 CFR 200:  \n  \n1.    OMB Circular A-21, Cost Principles for Educational Institutions.   \n  \nThis circular establishes principles for determining costs applicable to grants, contracts and other agreements between the federal government and educational institutions. These principles shall be used to determine the allowable costs of work performed by colleges and universities under sponsored agreements.   \n  \nSee www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars_a021_2004/ for the complete text of this Circular.  \n  \n2.    OMB Circular A-110, Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements with Institutions of Higher Education.   \n  \nThis circular sets forth the standards for obtaining consistency and uniformity among federal agencies in the administration of grants to and agreements with institutions of higher education. It covers record-keeping, program income, cost sharing and matching, standards for financial reporting, monitoring and reporting program performance, payments, revisions of financial plans, close-out procedures, suspension and termination procedures, and procurement/property management requirements.   \n  \nSee www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars_a110/ for the complete text of this Circular.  \n  \n3.    OMB Circular A-133, Audits of State, Local Governments and Non-Profit Organizations.   \n  \nThis circular is issued pursuant to the Single Audit Act of 1984 and Amendments of 1996. It sets forth standards for obtaining consistency and uniformity among federal agencies for the audit of states, local governments, and non-profit organizations expending federal awards.  \n  \nSee https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/omb/circulars/a133/a133.pdf for the complete text of this Circular.  \n  \n4.    Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  \n  \nThe FAR provides uniform policies and procedures for acquisitions by executive agencies of the federal government. These federal regulations are applicable to contractual arrangements which the UH enters into with federal agencies that are acquiring goods or services. Contract means a mutually binding legal relationship obligating the seller to furnish the supplies or services (including construction) and the buyer to pay for them. It includes all types of commitments that obligate the Government to an expenditure of appropriated funds and that, except as otherwise authorized, are in writing. In addition to bilateral instruments, contracts include (but are not limited to) awards and notices of awards; job orders or task letters issued under basic ordering agreements; letter contracts; orders, such as purchase orders, under which the contract becomes effective by written acceptance or performance; and bilateral contract modifications. Contracts do not include grants and cooperative agreements covered by 31 U.S.C. 6301, et seq. For discussion of various types of contracts, see Part 16.   \n  \nSee https://www.acquisition.gov/far/ for a complete text of the FAR.   \n  \n5.    Federal Demonstration Partnership (FDP) terms and conditions  \n  \nThe FDP is a cooperative initiative among participating federal agencies and institutional recipients of federal funds. Its purpose is to reduce the administrative burdens associated with research grants and contracts.  \n  \nThe Federal-wide research terms and conditions apply to newer awards.  \n  \nThe award terms and conditions will specify whether the FDP or Federal-wide research terms and conditions apply.  \n  \nSee http://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/fed_dem_part.jsp for information on the FDP terms and conditions.  \n  \nSee http://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/rtc.jsp for information on the Federal-wide research terms and conditions.  \n  \nD.    Fiscal Responsibilities and Administrative Functions within the UH  \n  \nThe primary responsibility for conducting sponsored research and training programs and ensuring that proper costs are charged in accordance with federal laws, state statutes, sponsor requirements and UH policies and procedures shall reside at the organizational level where transactions are initiated and controlled. This responsibility is shared by the Principal Investigator/Project Director (PI/PD), assigned Fiscal Administrator (FA), Chancellor/Dean/Director/Department Chairperson, as applicable (“Authorized UH Administrator”). (Note: \"PI\" is generally used in research projects, and \"PD\" is generally used in science and engineering education and other projects. However, some sponsors may use these terms interchangeably and appropriate substitutions should be made accordingly.)  \n  \n1.    The PI/PD shall be responsible and accountable for the satisfactory performance of scientific and technical work prescribed under the sponsored program or activity and the review of expenditures to ensure the allowability, allocability and reasonableness of all costs charged to the award in support of the project. The PI/PD shall be accountable for any program deficits and disallowances that may occur in the performance of work under the sponsored program or activity.  \n  \n2.    The assigned FA shall be responsible for controlling program expenditures within the sponsor's funding authorization in accordance with sponsor's requirements and UH policies and procedures. The FA shall also provide guidance and assistance to the PI/PD and staff concerning administrative and financial matters, particularly those relating to the allowability and allocability of program costs, sponsor's prior approval requirements if any, program financial status, delivery and coordination of administrative support requirements, proper recording of expenditures and cost transfers and the liquidation or cancellation of all outstanding encumbrances to ensure the timely closeout of projects.  \n  \n3.    The applicable Authorized UH Administrator shall have overall responsibility for the performance of work conducted by the PI/PD and shall monitor and ensure that all deliverables and performance requirements are satisfactorily completed within the sponsor's authorized funding and project period including the submission of the final technical reports. The applicable Authorized UH Administrator shall ultimately be responsible for all program deficits and cost disallowances under their jurisdiction including the securing of necessary funds to cover such costs.  \n  \n4.    The Property and Fund Management Office (PFMO) shall be responsible for the preparation and submission of the final equipment and inventory reports to sponsors including, the resolution of title transfers, final disposition of equipment and the monitoring of small business utilization reports to sponsors, if required.  \n  \n5.    The Office of Research Services (ORS) shall be responsible for the coordination, follow up and monitoring of all UH grants, contract and other award agreements with external sponsors including any revisions thereto. ORS shall be the focal point of contact for the UH and will serve as the liaison with external sponsors. All change requests to the sponsoring agency must be endorsed by ORS. ORS shall also be responsible for the review and monitoring of reporting requirements imposed by the federal government relating to patents, copyrights and inventions, and the submission of periodic and final technical/performance reports to sponsors. ORS shall be responsible for account establishment and maintenance, invoicing, letter of credit draw downs and financial reporting matters related to extramurally funded project accounts. ORS Compliance shall perform monitoring activities to ensure adherence with Federal laws, State statutes, sponsor requirements and UH policies and procedures.  \n  \nE.    Administrative and Financial Management Requirements  \n  \n1.    Allowability of Program Costs  \n  \na)    The allowability of costs charged to federally sponsored programs shall be governed by the provisions of 2 CFR 200 Subpart E – Cost Principles and as noted in Section 4. above, OMB Circular A-21 sections C and J.  \n  \nb)    PI/PD shall review the sponsored project account activity in a timely manner (preferably monthly) to ensure that charges are properly recorded;  \n  \n2.    Post-Award Changes and Other Programmatic/Budget Revisions  \n  \na)    A certain degree of latitude is generally permitted by most federal sponsoring agencies. Changes are generally limited to minor reprogramming of funds between budget categories and within the total authorized direct cost budget to meet unanticipated program needs.  \n  \nb)    Post-award changes requiring prior approval of the sponsoring agency are governed by the provisions of 2 CFR 200 Subpart D §200.308 and as noted in Section 4. above, OMB Circular A-110 Subpart C – Post Award Requirements Item .25  \n  \nORS shall be responsible for action on all requests for post-award changes which require sponsoring agency's approval including those institutional prior approval requirements that have been delegated to the UH by certain sponsoring agencies.  \n  \n(1)    The appropriate approval shall be immediately requested when there is reason to believe that revisions will be necessary to meet unanticipated program needs or to accomplish certain programmatic changes. All requests to funding agencies for any budgetary and programmatic changes must be initiated in advance and in writing by the PI/PD, reviewed by the departmental FA, approved by the applicable Authorized UH Administrator, and endorsed by ORS before submission to the sponsoring agency.  \n  \n(2)    For subawards, the prior approval authority is usually the prime recipient of the grant or contract. Any action or cost that is inconsistent with the purpose or terms of a federally sponsored agreement shall not be approved.  \n  \nc)    Although the project budget represents the best estimate of expenditures which will be incurred in the performance of the stated requirements of the award, a sponsoring agency may occasionally change the terms or otherwise modify a contract or grant. This may affect the allowability of purchases or other expenditures requested on the project. If a modification or new contract is forthcoming, ORS should be notified immediately.  \n  \nWhen there is a degree of uncertainty for sponsor's approval of a modification requested, the PI/PD will indicate an alternate source of funds to cover unallowable expenditures if the modification is not granted. This enables project activities to proceed without delays introduced by the approval process. (Refer to AP A8.952, Advance Funding Accounts for Externally Financed Programs and Activities.) In the event the changes are not approved by the sponsor, the FA should submit a cost transfer to clear the unallowed cost(s).  \n  \nd)    Contracts and grants awarded under FDP terms and conditions delegate approval authority to the UH to facilitate some post-award administrative changes. These delegated authorizations are administered by ORS. However, the following post-award changes require the sponsoring agency's approval in all cases.  \n  \nFor awards subject to 2 CFR 200 (see section C. above):  \n  \n(1)    Change in the scope or the objective of the project or program (even if there is no associated budget revision requiring prior written approval).  \n  \n(2)    Change in key person specified in the application or the Federal award.  \n  \n(3)    The disengagement from the project for more than three months, or a 25 percent reduction in time devoted to the project, by the approved project director or principal investigator.  \n  \n(4)    The inclusion, unless waived by the Federal awarding agency, of costs that require prior approval in accordance with 2 CFR 200 Subpart E - Cost Principles.  \n  \n(5)    The transfer of funds budgeted for participant support costs as defined in 2 CFR 200.75 Participant support costs to other categories of expense.  \n  \n(6)    Unless described in the application and funded in the approved Federal awards, the subawarding, transferring or conracting out of any work under a Federal award.  This provision does not apply to the acquisition of supplies, material, equipment or general support services.  \n  \n(7)    Changes in the approved cost-sharing or matching provided by the non-Federal entity.    \n  \nFor awards subject to OMB Circular A-21 and A-110 (see section C. above):  \n  \n(1)    Change of the PI/PD or other key personnel.  \n  \n(2)    A 25 percent reduction in the PI's level of effort.  \n  \n(3)    Absence of the PI for more than three months.  \n  \n(4)    Change in the scope or the objective of the project or program (even if there is no associated budget revision requiring prior written approval).  \n  \n(5)    Change in the project budget period.  \n  \n(6)    The need for additional federal funding.  \n  \n(7)    The transfer of amounts budgeted for indirect costs to absorb increases in direct costs, or vice versa, if approval is required by the Federal awarding agency.  \n  \n(8)    The transfer of funds allotted for training allowances (direct payment to trainees) to other categories of expense.  \n  \nIn addition, some sponsoring agencies reserve the right to approve certain additional changes.  Requests to the sponsoring agency for approval of any such changes must be endorsed by ORS.  \n  \ne)    Since it is not possible to cover all situations requiring prior approval, programs should consult with ORS or the authorized officer or official of the sponsoring agency whenever rebudgeting or other post-award changes are contemplated or if there are uncertainties regarding the allowability of costs or activities.  \n  \n3.    Continuation Accounts (Suspense Accounts)  \n  \nA continuation account must be designated on all accounts with an expiration date and is used to accept transactions posted to an expired account. FAs shall review transactions posted to continuation accounts in a timely manner and transfer the amounts to the proper account. Campus level FAs are responsible for ensuring that balances in the continuation accounts are cleared by fiscal year end.  \n  \n4.    Expenditure Controls / Cost Overruns  \n  \nFA s shall monitor allotments, expenditures and project periods to ensure that deficits and past due conditions are prevented or corrected. An expenditure recorded in a sponsored project account in excess of the approved project budget may result in a cost overrun. Cost overruns and inappropriate charges must be reversed or transferred to an appropriate non-sponsored account.  \n  \n5.    Cost Transfers  \n  \nCost transfers are an after-the-fact correction or reallocation to move costs from or to an extramural project account. With the FA's assistance, PIs shall review and reconcile all sponsored accounts in a timely manner. Cost transfers should generally be processed no later than 90 days after the date of the original transaction (preferably within 60 days after posting of original transaction) in order for the UH to prepare accurate financial statements and receive proper reimbursement from our sponsors. An explanation of why the cost was incorrectly charged in the first place, and why a transfer is necessary shall be provided. Documentation to support the authorization of the cost transfer shall also be attached, if applicable. If the transfer is to a sponsored account, certification that the charge is allowable, allocable and reasonable is required. Reason for any untimely cost transfers should also be provided.  \n  \n6.    Program Closeout  \n  \nRefer to AP A8.954 – Extramural Closeout Procedures for The UH’s procedures related to closeout of extramural accounts.  \n  \n7.    Monitoring and Reporting of Program Performance  \n  \nSponsored programs shall be monitored to ensure performance requirements under grants and other agreements are satisfactorily met and that the overall program performance goals are achieved within the authorized funding and program period.  \n  \na)    The PI and respective Chancellor/Dean/Director shall administer the monitoring and reporting requirements in compliance with 2 CFR 200.328 and Subpart C – Post-Award Requirements Reports and Records item 51 “Monitoring and reporting program performance” of OMB Circular A-110 and with any specific terms or conditions of a grant or award.  \n  \nb)    ORS shall coordinate submission and assist with monitoring that all technical and programmatic performance matters including reports are submitted in accordance with the applicable federal regulations or specific terms and conditions of grants and awards.  \n  \n8.    Retention and Custodial Requirements for Records  \n  \na)    For Federal grants, financial records, supporting documents, statistical records, and all other records pertaining to sponsored agreements shall be retained for a period of at least three years from the date of submission of the final expenditure report or for Federal awards that are renewed quarterly or annually, from the date of submission of the quarter or annual financial report.  \n  \nThe following exceptions may apply:   \n  \n(1)    If any litigation, claim or audit starts before the expiration of the three year period, records shall be retained until all litigations, claims, or audit findings involving program records have been resolved.  \n  \n(2)    When notified by the sponsoring agency to extend the retention period  \n  \n(3)    Records for real property and equipment acquired with Federal funds must be retained for three years after final disposition  \n  \n(4)    When records are transferred to the sponsoring agency, the three year retention requirement is not applicable  \n  \n(5)    Retention for records for program income earned after the period of performance, if reporting required, starts from the end of the fiscal year in which the income is earned  \n  \nb)    For federal contracts, the retention period starts from the end of the fiscal year during which an entry is made charging or allocating a cost to the contract.  When records generated during a prior contract are relied on for cost or pricing data for negotiating a succeeding contract, the retention period starts from the date of the succeeding contract.  For federal contracts, if the above do not apply, then any other applicable period specified in FAR Subpart 4.7.  \n    \nc)    For all others grants and awards, the specific terms and conditions of the grant or award may apply.    \n  \nd)    Pertinent books, documents, papers, and records of the UH and its subrecipients shall be made available and accessible to the sponsoring agency, Inspector General and the Comptroller General of the United States or any of their duly authorized representatives for audits, examinations, transcripts and excerpts.  \n  \n9.    Methods for Collection, transmission and Storage of Information  \n  \na)    In accordance with the May 2013 Executive Order of Making Open and Machine Readable the New Default for Governmental Information, whenever practical, collect, transmit and store award related information in open and machine readable formats rather than in closed formats or on paper.    \n  \nb)    When original records are electronic and cannot be altered, there is no need to retain paper copies.  \n    \nc)    Upon request, the sponsoring agency must provide or accept paper versions of the information related to the award.  When original records are paper, electronic versions may be submitted provided they are subject to periodic quality review, safeguarded against alteration and remain readable.    \nIV. Delegation of Authority  There is no administrative procedure specific delegation of authority.    \nV. Contact Information  Office of the Vice President for Research and Innovation, telephone number: (808) 956-4740; and email [lgouveia@hawaii.edu](mailto:lgouveia@hawaii.edu?subject=8.926) may be contacted for information   \nrelating to this Administrative Procedure.    \nVI.

Purpose To provide guidance on establishing and maintaining University account codes (accounts).\nII. Definitions Account – The account code is a seven (7) character code representing a functional unit established for a specific purpose with one individual having primary responsibility for it. It monitors the financial activities for a functional unit.\nIII. Administrative Procedure A. General Guidelines\n\n1. An account represents the smallest unit of activity or lowest level of responsibility at which accounting data is collected and maintained. It is required with each accounting transaction and is used to analyze data for various levels of financial reporting.\n\n2. New accounts shall be established whenever separate accounting and reporting are required for legal, organizational, or functional reasons. Accounts shall not be established for record-keeping purposes which can be accomplished by the proper use of object codes (see AP 8.615).\n\n3. Advance accounts for extramurally funded research and training projects may be created when authorized according to AP 8.952.\n\n4. New appropriation codes shall be coordinated with the General Accounting and Loan Collection (GALC) office.\n\nB. Establishment of Accounts\n\nThe following applies to non-extramural accounts. For information on setting up extramural accounts, please contact the Office of Research Services (ORS).\n\n1. To establish a new account, either copy an existing account or create a new account in KFS. This will create a new electronic document (edoc).\n\n2. Enter an appropriate Description and Explanation.\n\n    a. The Description should start with your three (3) digit FO code (e.g. 036 Create new RTRF account)\n\n3. In the Account Number field, use the following convention to create a “dummy” account number:\n\n    a. Sub-Fund Group Type Code (1 character) + FO Code (3 digits) + discretionary sequence number (3 digits)\n\n    b. The resulting account number should consist of seven (7) characters\n\n    c. The Sub-Fund Group Type Codes can be found in KFS (e.g. A = Agency, B = Bond, F = Federal, G = General, P = UH Trust, R = Revolving, S = Special)\n\n    d. The discretionary sequence number is a number assigned by the preparer to keep track of their new accounts internally and can be any three (3) digit number\n\n    e. Example of a dummy account number for a new revolving fund account established by FA 036: R036001\n\n4. Enter or revise the remaining attributes of the new account. Ensure that the proper attributes are being used for the account (i.e. correct Higher Education Function Code, Revenue Function Code, Sub-Fund Group Code, UH Fund-Appropriation, etc.).\n\n    a. Ensure that the Sub-Fund Group Code and the UH Fund-Appropriation are consistent (e.g. an account with Sub-Fund Group Code “SOTHER” should have a UH Fund-Appropriation that starts with an “S”)\n\n5. Ensure that the edoc will route to the appropriate campus budget office. If the campus budget office is not automatically included in the routing, adhoc (approve) route the edoc to them.\n\n6. Once the edoc is submitted by the preparer, it will route to the following for review and approval:\n\n    a. Campus budget office\n\n    b. KFS campus chart manager (CC, HI, MA, WO, SW)\n\n    c. KFS system chart manager (GALC)\n\n7. The KFS system chart manager in GALC removes the dummy account number and assigns a permanent account number. The master list of new accounts (with the exception of extramural accounts maintained by ORS) is maintained by GALC.\n\n8. The KFS system chart manager in GALC adhoc (FYI) routes the edoc to the preparer to inform him/her of the new account number and approves the edoc. This finalizes the new account creation process.\n\nC. Maintenance of Accounts\n\n1. Changes to accounts are initiated in KFS either by editing a single account or by using a global edoc to edit multiple accounts within the same chart.\n\n2. The following account attributes should not be changed without GALC’s approval:\n\n    a. Sub-Fund Group Code\n\n    b. UH Fund-Appropriation\n\n3. Generally, for an account to be closed in KFS:\n\n    a. There should be no remaining balances in the account\n\n    b. There should be no current fiscal year transactions in the account\n\n    c. There should be no prior fiscal year thirteenth (13th) month transactions in the account\n\n    d. An appropriate Continuation Chart of Accounts Code and Continuation Account Number (see AP 8.650) should be used\n\n4. To reopen a closed account, please contact GALC.\nIV. Delegation of Authority There is no specific administrative delegation of authority.\nV.

Purpose To establish uniform guidelines and procedures for identifying equipment and controlled property of the University of Hawai‘i (University).\nII. Definitions No policy specific or unique definitions apply.\nIII. Administrative Procedure A. Identification of Inventorial Personal Property\n\n1. All inventorial personal property is identified by a tag which consists of a property number thereon. The property shall remain so identified by such tag as long as it is in the custody, possession, or control of the University. Assigned property tag numbers are recorded on all applicable documents and any records that may be part of the inventory system. A tag is removed or obliterated from the property only when it is no longer under the custody and control of the University. Once a tag has been assigned, no change is made during the life of the property regardless of inter-departmental or inter-campus transfers.\n\n2. Upon receipt of the assigned tag the asset representative is responsible for affixing the assigned tag to each newly acquired property. The tag should be affixed to the property in a position for easy sighting. Care should be exercised to place the tag on a clean, dry, smooth surface. In those situations where tags are impossible, if not impracticable to place on the property, records with the issued tags shall be maintained indicating the location and description of such property.\n\nB. Identification of Federal Personal Property\n\nFederal inventorial personal property is property the title to which vests with the Federal government. Federal inventorial personal property shall also be subject to the requirements of section III.A of this Administrative Procedure. Additionally, Federal inventorial personal property shall be identified with a red inventory tag with the statement “Property of U.S. Government.” The red inventory tag shall be physically affixed to the property next to or near the University tag. The property remains so identified as long as it remains in the custody, possession, or control of the University. If the University acquires title to the property, the red inventory tag shall be removed.\n\nC. Identification of Federal Property Other than Federal Inventorial Property\n\nIdentification, marking, and recording of federally-owned property other than that designated as Federal inventorial property (e.g. materials, supplies), is the responsibility of the Custodial Department and Asset Representative.\nIV. Delegation of Authority There is no administrative specific delegation of authority.\nV.

    "text": "Administrative Procedure 8.641\n\nTitle Journal Entries\nHeader Administrative Procedure Chapter 8, Business and Finance\nAdministrative Procedure AP 8.641, Journal Entries\nEffective Date: June 2016\nPrior Dates Amended: July 1982, August 2001\nResponsible Office: Office of the Vice President for Budget and Finance/Chief Financial Officer\nGoverning Board and/or Executive Policy: EP 1.102, Authority to Manage and Control the Operations of the Campus\nReview Date: June 2019\nI. Purpose To explain the process for recording accounting related journal entry adjustments in the University Kuali Financial System (KFS).\nII. Definitions Journal Entry Electronic Document (eDoc) - An accounting document used to record financial transactions or adjustments in the KFS. Journal entries should contain at least two accounting lines, and include explanations, references to and attachments of documentary evidence supporting the entries.\nIII. Administrative Procedure The KFS uses specialized eDocs to record journal entries. The different eDocs are designed to facilitate accurate recording of adjustments to general ledger accounts.\n\nA. Types of journal entry eDocs\n\n1. Distribution of Income and Expense (DI)\n\nThe DI document is used to distribute income or expense from a holding account to one or more appropriate accounts, when one account has incurred expenses or received income on behalf of one or more accounts. A DI can also be used to move income, expenses, assets, and liabilities to other sub-accounts, object codes, or sub-object codes.\n\n a. In most cases, the distribution will involve the movement of amounts from one account to another using the same object codes.\n\n b. The DI is also used to properly reclassify Amounts advanced to the Research Corporation of the University of Hawaii (RCUH) for service ordered projects using object code “7232 – RCUH EXPENSE/ADVANCE” to proper object code when spent.\n\n2. General Error Correction (GEC)\n\nThe GEC is used to correct accounting information that has been posted in the KFS.\n\n a. Examples of common usage at UH are:\n\n 1) Correcting accounts and object codes on a Financial Processing (FP) eDoc, or a PREQ (PO Invoice).\n\n 2) Account correction for an expense (e.g., supplies were charged to an incorrect account).\n\n b. The GEC accounting line includes a reference field for the original entry being corrected. This information provides an audit trail to support the correction and augments documentation attached to the eDoc.\n\n3. Transfer of Funds (TF)\n\nThe TF is used to transfer funds (cash) between accounts. This document only allows the use of certain “transfer” object codes. Transfers are neither revenue nor expenditures but for accountability purposes, a “transfer-in” behaves like revenue while a “transfer out” behaves like an expenditure. In KFS, these object codes have the following Object Sub-Type Codes:\n\n a. TM (Transfers Mandatory) – Transfers required by external third parties or contractual agreements because of:\n\n 1) Agreements relating to the financing of educational and auxiliary plant, or provisions for renewals and replacement of plant\n\n 2) Legislation requiring appropriate financing of educational activities\n\n 3) Legally binding endowment or other agreements\n\n b. TN (Transfers Non-mandatory) – Non-mandatory transfers are cash transactions between accounts that are initiated at the discretion of a governing board or management. For commonly used non-mandatory transfer object codes, see Attachment 1.\n\nThe from and to accounting lines for a particular transfer should have object codes with the same object sub-type code (e.g. there should not be a transfer between a TM object code and a TN object code). Also, the object code to use on an accounting line should describe the transfer destination account or source account. On the FROM accounting line, the object code should describe the account that the funds are being transferred to. Likewise on the TO accounting line, the object code should describe the account that the funds came from.\n\n4. Internal Billing (IB)\n\nThe IB eDoc is used to bill for goods or services provided by one university department to another university department, reflecting internal income to the provider and expense to the customer. The IB eDoc should be prepared by the department providing the goods or services since the document does not route to the responsible individual of the income accounting lines.\n\n5. Service Billing (SB)\n\nThe SB is used to record revenues and expenses between University accounts that have a pre-approved written agreement. The SB records the same transactions as the IB, but because of the pre-existing agreement, the SB eDoc does not route for approval and individuals need KFS authorization to be able to initiate SB eDocs.\n\n6. Salary Expense Transfer (ST)\n\nThe ST eDoc is used to move salaries and related benefit charges for a given employee for a particular paid date or set of paid dates from one or more accounts to one or more accounts.\n\nAn employee may have multiple Employee IDs (Emp IDs), however, only one primary Emp ID. The system only recognizes the primary Emp ID for salary and related benefits transfers. Data entry of the primary Emp ID will provide a listing of the payroll expenses for the selected employee by Paid Date for all associated Emp IDs. Security roles within the system, allow the ST initiator to view and move payroll expenses within their organization structure only.\n\nThe ST eDoc is used to correct an employee’s payroll expense that was charged to an incorrect accounting string. This error could occur for a number of reasons, including:\n\n a. Someone mis-keyed the payroll information, so the expense was initially posted to the wrong account.\n\n b. An employee was paid for work on a grant before the account was established, and the wages were initially posted into another account.\n\n c. The wages were initially paid on an expired or invalid account.\n\n d. An error was made when the employee was hired.\n\n e. A correction occurred in which the account was changed after an employee was paid.\n\n7. Journal Voucher (JV)\n\nThe JV is used to record adjustments that cannot be effectively recorded by other journal entry eDocs. Access to the JV is restricted to central office accountants.\n\nB. Fiscal Administrator responsibilities for processing a journal entry eDoc\n\n1. All required fields (*) must be completed.\n\n2. Provide a detailed explanation for the adjustment in the explanation field.\n\n3. Debit amounts must equal credit amounts.\n\n4. Attach supporting documentation in the notes and attachments tab.\n\n5. Additional reviewers can be added in the ad hoc recipients tab.\nIV. Delegation of Authority There is no specific administrative delegation of authority.\nV.

Definitions\n\n1. “General Confidentiality Notice” (“GCN”) – The GCN is completed as part of the onboarding process for new UH employees and outlines the responsibilities of Data Users with access to Protected Data. http://www.hawaii.edu/its/acer/\n\n2. “Information Security Awareness Training” (“ISAT”) – The ISAT covers best practices for protecting the privacy and security of Protected Data and applicable federal and state laws and regulations and related UH policies and procedures.  \n<http://www.hawaii.edu/its/acer/>\n\n3. “Institutional Data Systems” – They are UH systemwide repositories that collect and store data that are created, received, maintained and/or transmitted by the University of Hawai’i in the course of meeting its administrative and academic requirements (_e.g._ , Banner Student Information System, PeopleSoft, Kuali Financial System, STAR, Laulima, etc.).  \nA listing of Institutional Data Systems and associated System Executive Data Stewards is available at the following site. Note the list is not intended to be all-inclusive of the University’s Institutional Data Systems, but rather, represents Institutional Data Systems that most likely contain Protected Data.  \n<http://go.hawaii.edu/ueP>\n\n4. “Protected Data” – These are data that are subject to security and privacy considerations (i.e., all non-public data). They fall under the Institutional Data Classification Categories of “restricted,” “sensitive,” and “regulated.” For more information, refer to Executive Policy EP2.214, Institutional Data Classification Categories and Information Security Guidelines.\nIII. Administrative Procedure\n\n1. APPLICABILITY\nMandatory training requirements consist of acknowledging the General Confidentiality Notice (GCN) and completing the Information Security Awareness Training (ISAT).   \nThese training requirements apply to all UH employees except for employees who meet all three criteria below:   \n\n1. Their duties are not office- or classroom-based;\n2. Their duties do not involve working with Protected Data; and,\n3. They have limited access to technology at work.\nSupervisors are responsible for determining whether employees within their unit are exempt and should consult with their departmental HR office if they need guidance and/or assistance.  \n\n2. TRAINING AND CONTINUING EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS BY EMPLOYEE TYPE  \n\n1. UH New Hires  \n\n1. As part of the onboarding process, all newly hired UH employees, including student employees and graduate assistants, and excluding exempt employees (refer to section A), are required to acknowledge the GCN and complete the ISAT within the first two weeks of employment.   \nA UH username and password are required to access the GCN and ISAT at www.hawaii.edu/its/acer.\n\n2. If a UH employee transfers to another unit within UH, the employee is not required to re-acknowledge the GCN and will not need to re-take the ISAT (i.e., the ISAT annual renewal date will remain unchanged).\n\n3. Completion of the GCN and ISAT will be required before access privileges to Institutional Data Systems are granted.\n\n2. Current UH Employees  \n\n1. All UH employees are required to re-take the ISAT annually, based on the anniversary date the ISAT was last completed.\n\n2. An email notification will be sent 30 and 7 days in advance to employees when an ISAT renewal is required. Another email will be sent on the expiration date.\n\n3. A valid ISAT must be maintained for continued access privileges to Institutional Data Systems.\n\n3. UH Affiliates  \n\n1.

All UH Foundation (UHF) employees are required to comply with the same requirements as UH employees.\n\n\n3. TRACKING / MANAGING COMPLIANCE  \n\n1. Each Vice President/Provost/Chancellor shall designate a primary individual responsible for coordinating and ensuring compliance with mandatory training and continuing education requirements for his or her respective unit/campus. This includes the acknowledgement of the GCN and completion of the ISAT within the first two weeks of employment. The ISAT will be completed annually thereafter.\n\n2. The primary designee may further designate the task of monitoring compliance. The primary designee and all individuals responsible for monitoring compliance for their units/campuses will have access to a web application that will provide them with GCN and ISAT completion statuses and reports.\n\n3. Employees designated as exempt from the training by their supervisors should be excluded from the web application that tracks GCN and ISAT compliance.\n\n4. Failure to complete the requirements by the specified due date shall be reported to the supervisor. Extenuating circumstances affecting an employee’s ability to complete the requirements on time shall be taken into consideration by the supervisor. A reasonable timeframe to complete the requirements will be set by the supervisor and communicated to the employee. Department chairs may assist faculty with temporary workload adjustments, as needed, to accommodate the completion of their training requirements.\n\n5. Access privileges to Institutional Data Systems shall be revoked upon failure to comply with the training requirements.\n\n6. Repeated non-compliance of mandatory training and continuing education requirements will follow University policies and procedures as well as applicable collective bargaining agreements, and may be subject to disciplinary actions up to, and including, termination.\n\n7. Compliance requirements for student employees and graduate assistants will be monitored by the unit where they are employed.\nIV. Delegation of Authority  No Delegation of Authority found\nV.

    "policy_content": "I. Purpose To provide a uniform method for accepting and processing resignations and retirements for University of Hawai‘i employees appointed by the Board of Regents (BOR).\n\nNote: Procedures for addressing separation from service of civil service employees are contained in the Department of Human Resources Development Policy and Procedure 702.003, Separation from Service; and Title 14, Hawai‘i Administrative Rules - Department of Human Resources Development, 14 - 14.01 – Resignation.\nII. Definitions 1. “Appointing authority” for the purpose of this administrative procedure shall mean those individuals, including Vice Presidents, Associate Vice Presidents, Provost, Vice Provost, Assistant Provost, Associate/Assistant Vice-Provost, Chancellors, Vice Chancellors, Associate/Assistant Vice Chancellors, Deans and Directors, etc., authorized to approve the hiring and termination of BOR appointees.\n\n2. “Resignation” means an action taken by an employee to sever his/her employment relationship with the University. Acceptance of a resignation by an appointing authority does not necessarily imply that the employee resigned in “good standing.”\nIII. Administrative Procedure 1. Applicability/Responsibility. This procedure applies to BOR employees contemplating resigning or retiring and to the appointing authority.\n\n2. Resignation\n\n1. Notice of Resignation\n\n1. Notice of resignation for included faculty members shall be in accordance with Article XII - Tenure and Service, I. Notice of Resignation, of the bargaining unit 07 agreement.\n\n2. Notice of resignation for all other BOR appointments: Written notice of resignation should be submitted to the respective appointing authority at least fifteen (15) calendar days before the effective date of resignation. Therefore, direct supervisors who receive written notification of resignation will immediately forward the resignation to the appropriate appointing authority.\n\n2. Acceptance of Resignation\n\n1. Written notice of resignation is accepted by the appointing authority upon submission by the employee. The appointing authority should notate “Acknowledged and Accepted”, and date the resignation notice, prior to forwarding to the HR Representative for action and inclusion in the employee’s official personnel file.\n\n2. If the appointing authority receives verbal notification of resignation from an employee, it is effective immediately. The appointing authority will provide the employee with written confirmation of the verbal resignation as soon as possible. The written confirmation may be sent by email or by U.S. mail to the employee’s last known address, or it may be hand-delivered to the employee, in which case it is recommended that the employee acknowledge receipt on the file copy.\n\n3. Resignation, whether oral or written, once submitted may only be rescinded with the consent of the appointing authority.\n\n3. Resignation Submitted During an Investigation. If an employee resigns while the subject of a pending investigation pertaining to an alleged impropriety on the employee’s part, the resignation may not impact the investigation. For example, options that are available for the appointing authority may include, but are not limited to:\n\n1. Discontinuing the investigation and accepting the resignation provided that the requirements of the Notice of Resignation above have been met; or\n\n2. Continuing the investigation and accepting the resignation on the condition that it may be changed to a discharge, depending upon the outcome of the investigation.\n\n4. Resignation Submitted Following Notice of Discharge. A resignation submitted following a notice of discharge may not impact the investigation. Actions that can be taken by the appointing authority may include, but are not limited to:\n\n1. Accepting the resignation provided that the effective date is on or before the effective date of the discharge; or\n\n2. Rejecting the resignation and effectuating the discharge.\n\n3. Retirement\n\n1. Notice of Retirement. A courtesy notice of retirement should be submitted to the employer preferably 2-4 weeks prior to the effective date in order to assist the employer in ensuring that operations are efficiently and effectively continued.\n\n2. Filing for Retirement. An employee planning to retire must contact the Employees’ Retirement System (ERS) to complete and file the necessary documents for retirement in accordance with ERS policies and procedures.\n\n4. Return Service Obligations\n\n1. Appointing authorities authorized to accept resignations and retirements are required to confirm that the employee has fulfilled any return service obligations following a sabbatical leave or paid professional improvement leave. Should there be any obligation outstanding, the employee shall be notified in writing of the outstanding obligation and the consequences of resignation or retirement, i.e., repayment of salary received during the sabbatical or paid professional improvement leave period.\n\n2. If the employee with an outstanding obligation decides to resign or retire, the appointing authority shall ensure that collection action is initiated in accordance with section 78-12, Hawai‘i Revised Statutes, and Administrative Procedure AP 8.877, Salary and Wage Overpayment Recovery.\nIV. Delegation of Authority There is no administrative specific delegation of authority.\nV.

    "text": "Administrative Procedure 9.880\n\nTitle  Policies and Procedures on Student Employment    \nHeader  Administrative Procedure Chapter 9, Personnel   \nAdministrative Procedure [AP 9.880](https://www.hawaii.edu/policy?action=viewPolicy&policySection=Ap&policyChapter=9&policyNumber=880), Policies and Procedures on Student Employment  \nEffective Date: July 2022  \nPrior Dates Amended: Amendment of Attachment 2 only prepared by Mānoa Career Center. This replaces Administrative Procedure No. A9.880 dated February 2015.  \nResponsible Office: Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs  \nGoverning Board and/or Executive Policy:  \nReview Date: July 2025    \nI. Purpose 1. To promulgate policies and procedures governing the employment of students by the University of Hawai‘i to provide for a student classification and pay plan; and to establish the conditions of employment for students.\n  2. Applicability. The provisions of this directive apply to all campuses and affiliated agencies employing University of Hawai‘i students. Campuses may establish additional procedures on student employment provided that they are in conformance with the provisions of this procedure.\nII. Definitions 1. Student Assistants. Students who are employed by the University of Hawai‘i or affiliate agencies while pursuing a certificate, degree or professional diploma. This employment, regardless of funding source, is a form of financial assistance enabling the students to pursue their education.

Campus Student Employment Office. That office of the campus which is responsible for the classification of student assistant positions, the finalizing of student assistant applications, and the placing of student assistants.  Individual campuses may make provisions to delegate these functions to other campus offices as may be appropriate to meet special campus needs. This office is responsible for the enforcement of these policies and is authorized to initiate necessary payroll transactions when violations persist (e.g. mandatory increments, termination upon graduation, incomplete I-9, etc.).\n  3. Educational Affiliation Amongst UH Campuses. Current federal regulations provide for international students to be employed up to 20 hours per week during the academic year and up to full time during the student's annual summer term. On-campus employment at an off-campus location is allowed, if there is an educational affiliation between a student's home campus and another campus or organization.  The University of Hawai‘i acknowledges that there exists a continuous and on-going educational affiliation amongst the UH campuses based on educational curriculum, the UH strategic plan, and these policies which facilitate UH student employment at all UH campuses.  Any UH-enrolled international student may be employed on any UH campus without needing prior authorization from the international student services unit at the student's home school provided the student meets all other eligibility criteria set forth in these policies and as established on the campus where the student seeks employment.\n  4. Earning Modules. That dollar portion, as determined by the campus financial aid office, of the student's financial aid package expected to be achieved through employment.  NOTE: Financial aid policies and procedures govern all aspects of earning modules for Federal Work Study students.\nIII. Administrative Procedure 1. Equal Employment Opportunity. It is the policy of the University of Hawai‘i to prohibit discrimination in employment including but not necessarily limited to the following laws:  1. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as amended (race, color, national origin, religion, sex, pregnancy) 2. Executive Order 11246 as amended (race, color, national origin, religion, sex 3. Equal Pay Act of 1963 as amended by Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972 (sex) 4. Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ages 40-70 5. Section 402 of the Vietnam Era Veteran's Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974 (veteran’s status) 6. Sections 503 and 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (physical or mental disability) 7. Hawai‘i Revised Statutes, Chapters 76, 78, 378 (race, sex, age, religion, color, ancestry, political affiliation, physical or mental handicap, marital status, arrest and court record) 8. The Americans with Disabilities Act (physical and mental disability) \n  2. Confidentiality Policy. Student employees at the University of Hawai‘ii may have access to confidential information relating to other students, faculty and staff and/or pertaining to the University in the course of performing their duties & responsibilities as student employees.  Under FERPA, federal law and University policy, educational records are protected from disclosure to third parties unless pursuant to narrow exceptions and that other confidential records must not be disclosed.  As part of their duties and responsibilities, student employees shall maintain the confidentiality of all such records during and after their period(s) of employment at the University of Hawai‘i. They shall not, directly or indirectly, disclose to any person other than their supervisor, or an individual approved by their supervisor, any information concerning such records. Any unauthorized disclosure may be grounds for immediate termination, prohibition of future employment and/or disciplinary action up to and including dismissal from the University of Hawai‘i.\n  3. Eligibility. Students who are meeting the academic standards on their campuses are eligible for employment under this program.  1. Generally, this means carrying at least a half-time course load, and 2. A minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.0 for community college, undergraduate and Law School students and 3.0 for graduate students. 3. International students usually must be full-time students as well as meet other eligibility criteria based on federal and state laws including but not limited to immigration regulations.\n  4. Employment Priority.  1. Students with greatest demonstrated need for financial support as determined by the campus financial aid office shall be given priority for placement. 2. Full-time students shall be given preference over part-time students. 3. Individual campuses will determine other priorities taking into account student degree status, nonstandard semester or term, volume of course work, program and curriculum requirements, and availability of positions. 4. Individual campuses may make exceptions to this provision as necessary to provide for unique situations as deemed justified by the campus student employment office.\n  5. Employment Status.  1. Appointment period shall be for a period not to exceed one year subject to renewal. 2. A reasonable training period of no more than ninety (90) days may be established on the date of hire as a probationary period. The student may be terminated without notice during the probationary period. 3. Otherwise, student assistants who are terminated prior to the end of their appointment period shall be notified in writing at least two weeks prior to the termination date unless terminated for due cause. If after the probationary period, the student feels that termination has been unfair, the grievance procedure ([AP 9.860](http://www.hawaii.edu/policy/ap9.860)) may be used to seek remedy. 4. Conversely, a student shall give at least two weeks\" notice of intention to resign so that a replacement may be obtained in a timely manner.\n  6. Work Conditions.  1. It is expected that student assistants will be allowed appropriate paid rest periods and meal breaks without pay.

No employer shall require students to work when they are scheduled for classes or examinations. For financial aid recipients (F1 payroll), violation of this provision could result in a charge to the department for wages earned and/or prohibition from further participation in the Federal Work Study program. 3. Employers shall make every reasonable effort to rearrange the students\" work schedules for the period of final examinations and for one full week prior to the final examination period to accommodate students\" study needs. 4. Student assistants may not work more than twenty (20) hours a week during regular semesters. Exceptions must be approved by the campus student employment office.\n  7. Employment Records.  1. Student employment records (time sheets and scan sheets) must be retained for a minimum of three (3) years if audited, otherwise, six (6) years from final termination for regular student assistants (F3 payroll). For financial aid recipients (F1 payroll), federal regulations specify that time sheets must be kept for a period of five (5) years following a completed audit. 2. Student assistants shall, upon request, be permitted to examine records and files pertaining to their employment and be given a copy of such material if it is to be used in connection with a grievance or personnel hearing.\n  8. Classification and Pay. All student assistant positions will be classified and paid in accordance with the guidelines contained in [Attachment 1](http://www.hawaii.edu/policy/docs/temp/AP9.880-ATTACHMENT_1.pdf). The campus student employment office shall have final jurisdiction over the classification of individual positions. All student assistants shall be paid on an hourly basis (See [Attachment 2](https://www.hawaii.edu/policy/ap/9/880/attach/AP9.880-Attachment_2.pdf) for pay schedule.)\n  9. Procedures.  1.

Federal regulations also require that an Employment Eligibility Verification (Form I-9) be completed for every employee. Instructions for completing and an up-to-date copy of the form can be found at <https://www.uscis.gov/i-9>. 3. All payroll changes must be implemented through the sece on- line system in accordance with existing payroll procedures. 4. Each campus/department employing student assistants is responsible for the timely submittal of on-line transactions and any required documents through the campus student employment office to the Payroll Office. 5. Each campus will promulgate procedures for the registration, referral, hiring, and paying of student assistants through the sece on-line system subject to the following:  1. All student assistants will be classified into one of the classes described in [Attachment 1](http://www.hawaii.edu/policy/docs/temp/AP9.880-ATTACHMENT_1.pdf). Upon initial hire within the University, students will be placed at step 1 of the class. Credit shall be given for longevity for employment in similar positions held within the University system. If a supervisor wishes to give credit for non-University experience, the supervisor must verify such experience in writing to the campus student employment office and provide documentation of such experience when requested. 2. Employing units will submit a job description for classification by the campus student employment office through the sece on-line system by completing the job listing form. All job descriptions listed on the sece on- line system will then be classified by the campus student employment office. Employing units may suggest a classification; the final determination shall be the responsibility of the campus student employment office. 3. Employing units shall announce all vacancies on the sece on-line system. All positions must be listed for at least 3 days or have 5 referrals taken prior to the creation of a placement record. If a qualified student is not available, the position may be reclassified through consultation between the employing unit and the campus student employment office. 4. Any position may be upgraded if there is a requirement for the higher level student assistant in the same job series. The incumbent may be promoted at this time if the position requirements are met. 5. When promoted to a higher class, the student assistant will be placed at step 1.The promotion must be implemented through the sece on-line system. The employer must establish the higher level job description by adding to the job series and obtaining approval from campus student employment office before promotion can be implemented. 6. Student assistants cannot be required to work at a higher class without compensation except for on-the-job training in preparation for promotions. 7. The following regulations apply to step increases (no change in job description, given within same class). The request is to be submitted by the employing unit to the sece on-line system where it is processed by the campus student  employment office.  1. Individual campuses may establish procedures for merit increases as appropriate.  2. If no merit increases are given, a student assistant must be given a yearly step increment on the anniversary date of initial hire, last promotion, or last step increase, provided that the student has worked a minimum of 400 hours at the previous step. 3. Students who have attained the top step of their assigned class do not qualify for further step increases. 4. Step increases must be attained in sequential order.\n  10. Overtime and Premium Pay.  1. Student assistants are entitled to overtime pay under the same conditions stated in the provisions of the State's Unit 03 Agreement. Generally, overtime work occurs when the student performs services, at the direction of the supervisor, if the hours of work are:  1. In excess of a scheduled eight-(8) hour workday. 2. In excess of 40 straight-time hours per workweek, 3. On any day which is observed as a legal holiday, or 4. When the major portion of a shift falls on a day observed as a legal holiday, work performed during the entire shift shall constitute overtime work. Upon occurrence of overtime work, student assistants shall be entitled to receive overtime compensation calculated, including all premium pay differentials, at the rate of 1 1/2 times their basic pay rate for each hour of overtime worked. \n  2. Premium Pay. Premium pay is an increase in the hourly rate of pay for work during special hours, or unusual schedules. Student assistants are entitled to premium pay for night hours under the same conditions stated in the provisions of the State's Unit 03 Contract Agreement. On the day of this revision, the agreement provides that:  1. Work scheduled between 6:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. is paid a night differential premium at the rate is $ .60 per hour.\n  3. Holiday Pay. Student assistants are entitled to holiday pay for work required on a day observed as a legal holiday under the same conditions stated in the provisions on the State's Unit 03 Contract Agreement. On the date of this revision, the holiday pay differential is 1.5 times the straight-time pay.\n  4. Agreement. Overtime and premium hours of work scheduled for the benefit of the employing unit must be compensated for at the overtime and/or premium rates as applicable. However, any or all of the overtime and premium pay provisions, except that for work in excess of 40 hours per work week may be waived, or modified, by mutual agreement when the work is scheduled solely for the convenience of the student. Although a formal signed agreement is not required to be submitted to the campus student employment office, the following is highly recommended:  1. A memorandum of the agreement shall be kept in the employing unit, with notations of the effective date, reason for, and the length of time the agreement is in effect, and  2. The agreement may be cancelled or modified at any time by mutual agreement, upon written advance notice of 10 working days.\n  5. Authorization. Prior approval, by persons authorized to expend funds, is required for overtime and premium work. Overtime pay is an allowable cost, only upon written authorization of the granting agency under the rules of some federal grants and contracts.\n  6. Compensatory Time Off. The compensatory time off provisions of State law apply only to guaranteed wage employment, and do not apply to students employed under the provisions of [AP 9.880](http://www.hawaii.edu/policy/ap9.880).\n  7. Other Compensation. Any perquisites given to student assistants must be approved by the campus student employment office.\nIV.

    "text": "Administrative Procedure 5.201\n\nTitle Procedures for Assigning Program Names and CIP Codes for Academic Programs\nHeader Administrative Procedure Chapter 5, Academic Affairs\nAdministrative Procedure 5.201, Procedures for Assigning Program Names and CIP Codes for Academic Programs\nEffective Date: August 2024\nPrior Dates Amended: N/A\nResponsible Office: Office of the Vice President for Academic Strategy\nGoverning Board and/or Executive Policy: [RP 5.201](https://www.hawaii.edu/policy?action=viewPolicy&policySection=Rp&policyChapter=5&policyNumber=201) Instructional Programs, [EP 5.201](https://www.hawaii.edu/policy?action=viewPolicy&policySection=Ep&policyChapter=5&policyNumber=201) Approval of New Academic Programs and Review of Provisional Academic Programs\nReview Date: August 2029\nI. Purpose To provide a procedure to ensure system-wide consistency in the naming and assigning of program codes for academic programs and to adhere to national standards in data reporting in order to comply with RP 5.201 and EP 5.201.\nII. Definitions\n1. Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP): A taxonomic scheme that supports the accurate tracking and reporting of fields of study and program completion activity developed and maintained by the U.S. Department of Education’s National Center for Education Statistics. The CIP consists of a CIP code, CIP title, and CIP description.\n\n2. CIP Code: The Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) code associated with the Official Program Name that is designated prior to Board of Regents (BOR) approval.\n\n3. CIP Title: The academic program title connected to the designated federal CIP code. This title is taken from the federal CIP database and may differ slightly from the BOR-approved Official Program Name.\n\n4. CIP Description: The brief narrative provided by the National Center for Education Statistics that is attached to each individual CIP code.\n\n5. Official Program Name: The name of the program, including parenthetical information, approved by the Board of Regents at the provisional program stage. It is the official name for purposes of the Board of Regents-conferred credentials and is used in University publications.\n\n6. Program Code Request (PCR): Includes a request for the program name and program code (consisting of the degree type, major name and major code), CIP Code, effective term, curriculum, required documentation, and approvals.\n\n7. Student Data Oversight Committee (SDOC): A Data Governance Committee subcommittee focused on improving data quality and access as well as providing guidance on future directions, priorities, and uses of student Institutional Data Systems. The SDOC has the authority to make decisions on student data issues and make recommendations to the Data Governance Committee on policies and principles related to data management and use (EP 2.215 Institutional Data Governance). SDOC manages the principles for program name, program description, and the U.S. Department of Education’s Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP), and code assignment.\n\nIII. Administrative Procedure\n1. The CIP policy adheres to the following basic principles, is further clarified in the SDOC Program Code Policies: \n\n1. National alignment: \n\n1. The program name and CIP code should align with the national database of CIP codes.\n\n2. The program curriculum alignment to the national definition is the defining factor in choosing a CIP code.\n\n3. The program name, contents and conferred degree should be in alignment for students’ understanding.\n\n4. A significant change to a program will generate a new program code and require President’s approval. A change in CIP code, program name or substantial modification of the curriculum would be a significant change. A non-significant change would be an industry-wide or institution-wide change to remain current with terminology or federally mandated CIP code changes.\n\n2. UH System alignment: \n\n1. If a similar program exists or uses the same Official Program Name in the UH System, then the same CIP classification shall be used.\n\n2. If the program name or CIP code is already in use within the UH System, the party proposing a CIP code for a substantially different program may not use the same code.\n\n3. The Official Program Name, content, and conferred degree (if applicable) should align to ensure coherency with students’ understanding of the credential and the program learning outcomes.\n\n4. The Official Program Name, the assigned program code, and CIP code shall be the same in all public documents.\n\n3. In the event the CIP classification and Official Program Name do not align, supplementary documentation for consideration may include recommendation/guidance from an applicable federal agency or accrediting body; peer institution CIP classification for similar programs; and/or applicable and citable non-industry/trade-specific higher education publications such as _The Chronicle of Higher Education._\n\n2. Requesting a CIP Code for a New Program. \n\nThe approval of a CIP code for a new program shall go through the relevant campus approval process before the request is forwarded to the Institutional Research, Analysis and Planning Office (IRAPO). \n\nThe steps are as follows: \n\n1. A campus seeking to develop a new program shall notify IRAPO regarding the need for a CIP code when submitting the provisional program proposal.\n\n2. The campus completes a “Program Code Request (PCR) - New” form and indicates the CIP code in the “Additional Comments” section. \n\n1. UH Community College campuses shall submit requests through the Office of the Vice President for Community Colleges (OVPCC).\n\n2. Four-year campuses may submit requests directly to IRAPO.\n\n3. Based on the campus’s PCR, IRAPO reviews the proposed Program Name and requested CIP code and CIP title while consulting with campuses as needed.\n\n4. The request is reviewed for recommendation by the Council of Chief Academic Officers (CCAO), SDOC, the Office of the Vice President for Academic Strategy (OVPAS) or the OVPCC.\n\n5. The OVPAS endorses the Authorization to Plan (ATP) request.\n\n6. IRAPO approves the PCR and the campus’s requested CIP code after consultation with the campus if needed. For advanced degrees, IRAPO will approve the CIP code based upon the recommendation of the Chancellor/Provost.\n\n7. IRAPO coordinates the implementation of the new program addition into the student information systems (Banner and DAPIR/ODS) after the CIP code for the new program has been approved.\n\n3. Requesting a Change in Program Name, Program Code, or CIP Code\n\n1. Requests involving significant change: Name/Code/CIP changes that reflect a significant program change are handled according to the requirements for new program authorizations as outlined in EP 5.201. \n\n1. When making significant changes, because the CIP code is the primary means of federal program reporting (Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System--IPEDS), the source used by college selection organizations (e.g., College Navigator, College Board), and because changes may impact financial aid and student visas, the implications of the program’s CIP code assignment should be taken into consideration.\n\n2. The Program Request Process is as follows: \n\n1. The campus submits a completed “Program Code Request (PCR) – Modification” form with the CIP code in the “Additional Comments” section.\n\n2. If the modified program name, program code, or CIP code is used by other programs in the UH System, approval must be obtained from all affected parties by the requesting campus.\n\n3. IRAPO reviews the program request for compliance with applicable Regents Policies and Executive Policies and requests modifications, if needed.\n\n4. For advanced degrees, IRAPO will approve based upon the recommendation of the Chancellor/Provost.\n\n5. The request is reviewed for recommendation by SDOC and either the OVPAS or OVPCC.\n\n6. IRAPO then coordinates the implementation of the campus’s change(s) in the student information systems (Banner and DAPIR/ODS) and validates correctness.\n\n2. Requests involving non-significant change: Requests to change a program name to remain current in terminology but not entailing any significant change in the program are made to the President. IRAPO then coordinates the implementation of the campus’s change(s) in the student information systems (Banner and DAPIR/ODS) and validates correctness. Maintaining currency in terminology means: \n\n1. A substantial number of a campus’ peer and benchmark institutions have adopted the program name change or \n\n2. The change follows the recommendation/guidance from an applicable federal agency, accrediting body, and/or industry consortium.\n\n4. If policy-related changes are made to the CIP process, these changes will be introduced by the OVPAS in conjunction with the OVPCC; IRAPO; Provost/Chancellors of impacted campuses; and reviewed by the SDOC and/or CCAO.\n\nApplicable University Policies\n\n1.

Purpose To provide uniform guidelines and procedures for the proper care and maintenance of equipment and controlled property accountable to the University of Hawai‘i (University).\nII. Definitions No policy specific or unique definitions apply.\nIII. Administrative Procedure A. General\n\n1. The University acquires significant amounts of equipment and non-expendable personal property every year through purchases, loans, sponsor transfers, gifts, and other means.\n\n2. The University is responsible for the proper care and maintenance of University, agency, and federally-owned equipment in accordance with sound management practices, applicable federal regulations, related property control manuals of the funding agencies, or the provisions of contracts and grants.\n\n3. Regular inspection and maintenance of equipment and controlled property ultimately reduces costs, maximizes the useful life of equipment and controlled property and demonstrates the University’s commitment to proper stewardship of its assets.\n\n4. The period of these responsibilities spans from the receipt of the property until the University is properly relieved of its accountability for the equipment and controlled property. \nB. Responsibilities\n\n1. Custodial department heads are responsible for establishing a maintenance program for University, agency, and federally-owned equipment and controlled property as required.\n\n2. It is the responsibility of the principal investigator/asset representative to ensure that the maintenance program is carried out for equipment and controlled property in their possession and control.\n\n3. Periodic reviews of records and procedures should be undertaken by the aforementioned individuals to determine if compliance and needs are being met as follows: \n\na. Preventive maintenance such as cleaning, lubricating, inspecting working parts and wiring, and calibration should be performed when required or needed; \n\nb. Reasonable inspection schedules for maintenance should be devised based on manufacturer’s specifications, or other qualified sources of information; \n\nc. The need for maintenance contracts/agreements should be evaluated; \n\nd. Records of maintenance or calibration events should be maintained by the department throughout the life of the asset. A record of maintenance costs should be maintained as required to disclose maintenance/repair actions taken and to assist in determining the economical usefulness of the equipment. \n\ne. Federally-owned equipment that becomes too costly to maintain should be reported to Federal Administrative Contracting Officer via the department’s fiscal office and the Property and Fund Management Office.\nIV.

Purpose  To provide uniform guidelines and procedures for establishing the value of equipment and controlled property recorded in the University of Hawaiʻi (University) Kuali Financial System.    \nII. Definitions  Refer to AP 8.509, Section II. for property and equipment related definitions.    \nIII. Administrative Procedure  A.  General  \n    1.    All equipment and controlled property shall have a recorded value for purposes of inventory replacement and reporting.  \n    2.    Asset representatives and fiscal administrators are responsible for ensuring that all applicable costs are included when establishing the property’s value.  \n    3.    The basis for the recorded valuation of equipment and controlled property is dependent on how an asset is acquired (i.e., purchased, transferred in, donated, etc.).  \n    4.    Cost is the accepted basis of valuation for recording the value of equipment and controlled property acquired by the University.  \nB.  Basis for Valuation  \n    1.    Valuation at Acquisition Cost  \n        a.    Cost incurred by the University to obtain an equipment or controlled property item and placing it into usable condition including taxes, freight, delivery, customs duty and installation.  \n        b.    Property valued at acquisition cost includes:  \n            (1)    Outright purchases from vendors of both new and used items  \n            (2)    Fabrication or construction of assets by the University  \n2.    Valuation at Established (Original Acquisition) Cost  \n    a.    Sponsor-owned property transferred to the University from a government agency or extramural sponsor is valued as its original acquisition cost.  \n    b.    Federal excess and surplus property (i.e., property from the DoD Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office) and other assets furnished by the Federal Government (i.e., in-place transfers) shall be valued at its original acquisition cost.  \n3.    Valuation at Fair Market Value  \n    a.    Fair market value (FMV) is the probable price that property would sell for to an unrelated buyer that knows the relevant facts about the property and where neither buyer or seller is under any compulsion to buy or sell.  \n    b.    The value of donated equipment and controlled property processed through the University of Hawaiʻi Foundation (UHF) is based on fair market value.  The fair market value of a donated item is determined by the donor/grantor or by independent appraisal.  \n    c.    The value of federal surplus items acquired from the State of Hawaiʻi, Surplus Property Management Office, shall be valued at 23.3 percent of its original acquisition cost.  Refer to AP 8.521, Property and Equipment Acquisition.  \n    d.     Equipment transferred or donated to the University by another institution or government agency shall be established at fair market value as determined by the principal investigator or individual receiving the equipment.    \nIV.

This is a new procedure that replaces [AP 8.506](https://www.hawaii.edu/policy?action=viewPolicy&policySection=Ap&policyChapter=8&policyNumber=506) and  \n[AP 8.528](https://www.hawaii.edu/policy?action=viewPolicy&policySection=Ap&policyChapter=8&policyNumber=528).  \nResponsible Office:  Office of the Vice President for Budget and Finance/Chief Financial Officer  \nGoverning Board and/or Executive Policy: [EP 1.102](https://www.hawaii.edu/policy?action=viewPolicy&policySection=Ep&policyChapter=1&policyNumber=102), Authority to Manage and Control the Operations of the Campus  \nReview Date:  May 2019    \nI. Purpose  To provide uniform guidelines and procedures for establishing property records and assigning asset tags for new acquisitions of equipment and controlled property in accordance with University of Hawaiʻi, State and Federal requirements (refer to Section VI. References, for hyperlinks to the federal regulations).    \nII. Definitions  Refer to AP 8.509, Section II. for property and equipment related definitions.    \nIII. Administrative Procedure  A.    Purchases of Equipment and Controlled Property  \n    1.    Purchases of equipment are fed into the Kuali Financial System (KFS) based on the object codes for the payment transactions.  Asset records are established by the Property and Fund Management Office (PFMO) for transactions that meet the criteria for equipment.  \n    2.    Purchases of controlled property are manually entered into KFS by PFMO based on an extraction of payment transactions assigned a controlled property object code.  \n    3.    Extramurally/Federally-Funded Purchases  \n        a.    The University may acquire property as a direct charge to an extramural/ federal contract or grant only when specified in the contract or grant or when authorized in writing by a contracting officer prior to acquisition.  The award’s principal investigator (PI) and fiscal administrator (FA) shall comply with the University’s requirements for extramurally/federally-funded purchases and with all flow-down provisions imposed by the prime recipient when the University is a subcontractor in receipt of extramural/federal funds.  \n    b.    The PI and FA shall comply with federal screening requirements as outlined   \nin the University’s procurement procedures for federally-funded purchases.  Departments shall also be aware of any agency-specific purchasing screening requirements prior to purchasing property.   \nB.    Donations of Equipment and Controlled Property  \n    1.    All donations of equipment and controlled property shall be coordinated with the advice and assistance of the University of Hawaiʻi Foundation (UHF).  \n    2.    The receiving University department shall complete the Transmittal Form for  \nNon-Cash Gifts and forward to UHF.  \n    3.    The UHF shall review and process applicable donation forms and those that meet the capitalization criteria for equipment and tracking criteria for controlled property will be forwarded to PFMO.  \nC.    Fabricated Equipment  \n    1.    Fabricated equipment is equipment that has been constructed or assembled into one identifiable unit.  The cost assigned to the unit is the total of its component parts, materials, consumable supplies and applicable labor.    \n    2.    The custodial department shall submit an Asset Fabrication Maintenance e-Doc in KFS to establish the fabrication asset.  A completed form PFMO-73, Fabricated Equipment, must be attached as supporting documentation.  \n    3.    Upon approval by PFMO, an asset tag number will be assigned and payments for component parts should cite the asset tag number for proper recordation of costs.  \n    4.    Payments for an equipment fabrication must be assigned an equipment  \nfabrication object code.  Payments will be applied to existing fabrication assets as directed by the custodial departments.  \n    5.    Upon substantial completion of the fabricated equipment, the asset representative shall submit form PFMO-73C, Substantial Completion of Fabricated Equipment, to the FA for transmittal to PFMO.  \n        a.     A fabrication is considered substantially complete when the equipment is first used for its intended purpose or when the funding award has expired.  \n        b.     Upon notification of substantial completion, PFMO shall place the fabricated equipment into service in KFS.  \nD.    Unrecorded Found Property  \n    1.    Unrecorded found property is property discovered by the custodial department which is not recorded in KFS.  The property must meet the capitalization criteria for equipment or controlled property.  All efforts will be made to determine the origin and ownership prior to taking action.  \n    2.    Unrecorded found property is manually entered into KFS by PFMO.  The following information shall be provided by the custodial department to PFMO to create a property asset record:  \n        a.    Description of the property  \n        b.

Circumstances surrounding the discovery  \n        j.    Estimated cost or estimated fair market value  \n        k.    Date property was “found” (used as the in-service date unless the acquisition date can be determined or confirmed by other means)  \nE.    Surplus Property  \n    1.    The University, as a non-profit, tax-exempt educational institution, may acquire federal or State of Hawaiʻi surplus property at a nominal cost from the Department of Accounting and General Services (DAGS), Surplus Property Office.  \n    2.    University departments and programs may acquire surplus property.  The acquisition of such property shall be coordinated in advance with the fiscal administrator for the department or program.  \n    3.  The University is authorized to participate in the federal program by designating “authorized representatives” from the University system to coordinate with the DAGS Surplus Property Office to officially authenticate the acquisition of such property in accordance with applicable federal laws (Federal Property and Administrative Services Act, Rehabilitation Act, Civil Rights Act, etc.).  The official representative designated for the University is PFMO.  \n        a.    Federal surplus property acquired from the DAGS Surplus Property Office shall be valued at 23.3 percent of its original acquisition cost.  Federal surplus property meeting the equipment or controlled property criteria shall be recorded into KFS.  Federal surplus property not meeting the criteria for equipment or controlled property shall be coded as expenditures of the current period.  \n        b.    Upon receipt of the federal surplus property, the property shall be placed in use for the purposes for which it was acquired within one year of receipt and shall continue to be used for such purposes for a minimum of one year from the date the property was placed in use.  \n        c.

These surplus property items shall be used for the purpose for which it was acquired for a minimum period of eighteen (18) months from the date the property was placed in use.  \n        d.    During the imposed period of restrictions, the custodial department shall not   \nsell, trade, lease, lend, cannibalize, dispose or permanently relocate the federal surplus property for use outside the State of Hawaiʻi without prior approval from the federal General Services Administration or from DAGS Surplus Property Office, as applicable.  \n        e.    These procedures are applicable for all funding sources, including extramural funds.  The extramural contract or grant must permit the acquisition from the DAGS Surplus Property Office.  \nF.    No-Cost Transfer of Property to the University  \n    1.    Equipment or controlled property transferred from another institution shall be reported to the department’s FA and PFMO as soon as possible after being notified of the intent to transfer equipment.

This is a new procedure that replaces [AP 8.511](https://www.hawaii.edu/policy?action=viewPolicy&policySection=Ap&policyChapter=8&policyNumber=511) and\n[AP 8.529](https://www.hawaii.edu/policy?action=viewPolicy&policySection=Ap&policyChapter=8&policyNumber=529).\nResponsible Office: Office of the Vice President for Budget and Finance/Chief Financial Officer\nGoverning Board and/or Executive Policy: [EP 1.102](https://www.hawaii.edu/policy?action=viewPolicy&policySection=Ep&policyChapter=1&policyNumber=102), Authority to Manage and Control the Operations of the Campus\nReview Date: March 2019\nI. Purpose To provide uniform guidelines and procedures for receiving equipment and controlled property purchased, furnished, or loaned to the University of Hawaiʻi (University).\nII. Definitions Government Furnished Property (GFP) – Property in the possession of or directly acquired by the Federal Government and subsequently made available to the contractor by transfer or delivery to the University (contractor) for performance of a contract or grant. Title to GFP remains vested in the government unless ownership transfer is indicated.\nIII. Administrative Procedure A. General\n\nReceiving includes the process of verification and accepting delivery of equipment and controlled property into the University. Once acknowledged and documented by the receiving department, it establishes the point at which responsibility, accountability, and liability for the property begins. If required, key information is collected as part of the receiving process in order to create complete and accurate asset records in the Kuali Financial System (KFS).\n\nB. Purchased Equipment and Controlled Property\n\n1. The requisitioner or other authorized representative within the receiving department is responsible for the receipt of equipment and controlled property. Upon delivery, a physical inspection shall be conducted to verify at a minimum:\n\na. Item(s) received matches item(s) ordered;\n\nb. Quantity received matches quantity ordered;\n\nc. No visible damage to the item(s) ordered.\n\n2. If there are discrepancies with the order (i.e., overage or shortage) or damage is found, the departmental requisitioner or other authorized representative is responsible for providing prompt notification to the vendor or carrier. All appropriate actions necessary to resolve the discrepancies with the vendor or carrier shall be completed in a timely manner as it may affect asset depreciation, liability, warranties, and the ability of the University to meet sponsored project delivery schedules.\n\n3. Purchasing documents for acquisitions of property shall include the asset description, manufacturer, model number, serial number and location. The date of delivery shall be noted as well as the date of receipt of the invoice for payment and property inventory purposes.\n\n4. Vendors shall be paid no later than thirty calendar days following receipt of the\ninvoice or satisfactory delivery of the goods or performance of the services in accordance with the University’s accounts payable processing procedures.\n\n5. The Property and Fund Management Office (PFMO) will establish the\nnecessary asset record and issue an identification asset tag to affix onto acquired property no later than thirty-five calendar days after the payment has been made.\n\n6. The University establishes and maintains equipment and controlled property records according to property management standards that are consistent with voluntary consensus standards for non-expendable personal property.\n\nC. Sponsor-Furnished or Loaned Equipment and Controlled Property\n\n1. The receipt of equipment and controlled property not purchased by the University, such as sponsor-furnished equipment or loaned equipment, also requires prompt verification of quantity and condition before the University assumes accountability. Sponsor-furnished equipment and controlled property includes items furnished by the State of Hawaiʻi, the Federal Government, other educational institutions, and other private organizations.\n\n2. For equipment that is provided in support of a sponsored project, the principal\ninvestigator or authorized designee is responsible for receiving the equipment and\ncontrolled property and promptly furnishing PFMO with the signed transfer/receipt form(s) via the departmental fiscal office. Depending on the sponsor, documentation of the property transfer may be processed using one of the following forms:\n    - DD Form 1149, Requisition and Invoice/Shipping Document\n    - DD Form 250, Material Inspection and Receiving Report\n    - GSA SF 122, Transfer Order Excess Personal Property\n    - Transmittal Letter\n    - Memorandum of Understanding\n\n3. Government furnished property that is furnished by means of the GSA\nStandard Form 122, and which is to be cannibalized, shall carry the typed statement “To Be Cannibalized” on the face of the form. The item(s) used as a result of the cannibalization shall be reported and recorded into the incorporated item. If not to be incorporated, item(s) must be properly categorized as to type of property and entered into the inventory.\n\n4. At the time of receipt of equipment furnished by the Federal Government, any\nvisible, audible, or other external evidence of damage shall be notated on the receiving document with the signature of the carrier’s agent. Any damage found upon receipt will require notification from the accountable University department to the appropriate sponsor via their fiscal office and PFMO for any corrective action. Additionally, if there is any error in quantity or if the property received is unsuitable for its intended purpose, the same notification process must be followed prior to taking any corrective action(s).\n\n5. Similarly, any damage found upon receipt of loaned property will require notification from the accountable University department to the appropriate sponsor via their fiscal office and PFMO for any corrective action.\nIV. Delegation of Authority There is no administrative specific delegation of authority.\nV.

Purpose This procedure recognizes [Board of Regents Policy (“RP”) 12.207](http://www.hawaii.edu/policy/rp12.207)\n\nThis procedure redirects the policy and procedure for federally funded purchases to [Regents Policy (RP) 12.207](http://www.hawaii.edu/policy/rp12.207) and [Administrative Procedure (AP) 12.203](http://www.hawaii.edu/policy/ap12.203), which identifies the Office of Research Services (ORS) and the Research Corporation of the University of Hawaii (RCUH) as providing fiscal and administrative services, including but not limited to, the procurement of goods, services, and construction, for extramurally sponsored research and training projects, including those sponsored by federal contracts and grants.\nII. Definitions Extramural contracts and grants refer to external sponsorship of research, training, or other activities such as a federally funded grant or contract.\nIII. Administrative Procedure 1. Pursuant to RP 12.207 and AP 12.203, RCUH provides fiscal and administrative services to the University for the University’s extramural contracts and grants with federal sponsors. Except for split funded purchases with non-federal funds, all procurement contracts and purchase orders utilizing federal funds shall be processed through ORS and RCUH to ensure compliance with all applicable federal rules and regulations through the inclusion of terms and conditions required by the particular federal grant or contract.\n\n2. Split Funded Purchases. Split funded procurements involving a federally sponsored research or training account and a University non-federal fund account shall be processed as a University procurement action through the University financial system. The federal rules and regulations, as addressed in RCUH policies and procedures, would still apply to these split funded procurements. Purchases intended for the support of federally funded contracts and grants shall not be supplemented with funds from a University non-federal fund account for the primary purpose of creating a split-funded purchase in order to evade processing through ORS and RCUH.\n\n3. Additional Information. Any questions regarding the requirements of federally funded purchases of goods and services under extramural contracts and grants should be directed to ORS and/or RCUH.\nIV. Delegation of Authority In accordance with [Executive Policy 12.102](http://www.hawaii.edu/policy/ep12.102), the Vice President for Research and Innovation or authorized designee(s) are delegated authority to sign and execute all systemwide extramural contract and grants (research and training), agreements and contract assignments and releases under $5,000,000. Finalized contract/grant documents, contract assignments and releases shall be reviewed by the Office of Research Services as provided in applicable university policies and instructions.\nV.

Definitions  Refer to AP 8.509, Section II. for property and equipment related definitions.    \nIII. Administrative Procedure  A.    Transfer of Property  \n  \n    1.    General Guidelines  \n  \n        a.     Ownership of equipment and controlled property vests with either the University or the sponsor of an award.  It is the responsibility of the principal investigator (PI), asset representative or fiscal administrator (FA) to obtain the appropriate approvals and documentation required to facilitate the transfer of property.  \n  \n        b.    University-owned equipment in excess to a program should be offered for reutilization by another University department or State agency.  Such equipment shall not be physically transferred until the Property and Fund Management Office (PFMO) has approved the transfer in the Kuali Financial System (KFS).  \n  \n        c.    Property furnished by the Federal Government or whose cost was charged to a project supported by a federal contract, grant or other agreement, shall be utilized in accordance with AP 8.542, Property and Equipment Utilization.  Transfer of this property shall follow the same hierarchy outlined in AP 8.542 unless otherwise specified in the sponsored agreement.    \n  \n    2.    Transfers within the University System   \n  \n        a.  University-owned property acquired with non-extramural funds  \n  \n            (1)    Excess University-owned property acquired with non-extramural funds shall be made available to other University departments via The UH Swap Meet (https://www.hawaii.edu/swapmeet/) administered by the Information Technology Services department.  \n  \n            (2)    Transfer of University-owned  property acquired with non-extramural funds shall be transferred by processing an asset transfer e-Doc.  \n  \n        b.  University-owned property acquired with extramural funds  \n  \n            (1)     If the property is on an active award, the property may be transferred after the PI of the property obtains the necessary documentation to support the transfer.  If the transfer is in accordance with the terms of the contract, grant or other agreement, a copy of such terms would be sufficient.  Otherwise, the PI shall obtain the following:  \n  \n                (a)    Property acquired under a federal contract requires written authorization from the sponsor’s Federal Contracting Officer.   \n  \n                (b)    Property acquired under a federal grant or other agreement may be transferred if the transfer is in accordance with the hierarchy outlined in AP 8.542, Property and Equipment Utilization.  Written documentation in support of this will be sufficient.  All other transfers will require written authorization from the sponsoring agency.   \n  \n            (2)    If the property is on an expired federal award with a current value of $5,000 or less, the property may be transferred if the transfer is in accordance with the hierarchy prescribed in AP 8.542, Property and Equipment Utilization.  All other transfers will require written authorization from the federal sponsoring agency.  \n  \n            (3)    Transfer of University-owned property acquired with extramural funds shall be processed by submitting an asset edit e-Doc to transfer the asset FO code, the asset location and the asset representative, as necessary.  The organization owner chart of accounts code and the account number for the receiving department shall be noted on the asset edit e-Doc and PFMO will use this information to update the asset record in KFS.  \n  \n        c.     Federally-owned and agency-owned property require written authorization from the sponsoring agency prior to transferring the property.  \n  \n    3.    Transfers to other State Departments   \n  \n        a.    If there is no other University department or program that has need for a department’s excess property, the property may then be offered to a State department via the State Procurement Office’s Excess State Property List.    \n  \n        b.    Departments must forward a completed Excess State Property Form SPO-019 to PFMO for submission to the State Inventory Management Office.  Property acquired with extramural funds may require sponsor’s approval as outlined in section A.2.b. and c. above.  \n  \n        c.    If there is interest by another State department, the custodial department shall submit an asset retirement e-Doc to transfer the asset from the University to the consenting State department.  The custodial department shall complete and attach the State of Hawaiʻi Transfer of Property, SPO Form 26, to the asset retirement.   \n  \n        d.    The custodial department shall be responsible for subsequently attaching to the approved asset retirement a fully completed and signed SPO Form 26 (i.e., with the receiving signature and date of receipt).  \n  \n    4.    Transfers to Another Institution  \n  \n        a.    Federally-owned or agency-owned property furnished to support the efforts of the transferring PI shall be transferred along with the PI only when written authorization from the sponsor has been obtained (e.g., authorization from the Federal Contracting/Grants Officer for federally-owned property).  \n  \n        b.    University-owned property acquired with extramural funds on on-going active awards may be transferred with PIs to continue their research at another institution.  In such instances, the property whose cost was charged to the on-going projects supported by a federal contract, grant or other agreement shall be transferred along with PI with verification of the transferred award.  \n  \n        c.    University-owned property acquired with extramural funds on an expired or terminated award may be transferred with PIs to continue their research at another institution.  The following documentation shall be required for the transfer of such property:  \n      \n            (1)    If the property was funded by a federal contract and the current value is more than $5,000, the PI or the FA shall obtain written authorization from the Federal Contracting Officer to transfer the property.  \n  \n            (2)    If the property was funded by a grant or other agreement or if the property was funded by a contract and the current value is $5,000 or less, the Dean or Director of the department shall submit a memo to PFMO confirming that the property is no longer required by the department and is in excess to the program.  The PI shall also provide certification to the University that the property shall be used in accordance with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-110.  \n  \n        d.    University-owned property acquired with both University and extramural funds may not be transferred without the receipt of adequate compensation to the University.  \n  \n    5.    Transfer of Ownership to the University  \n  \n        a.    The PI of an award is responsible for requesting the transfer of ownership from the sponsoring agency to the University for extramurally-owned property.  \n  \n        b.    The fiscal office shall notify PFMO when the transfer of ownership from the sponsoring agency has been granted and PFMO will initiate an asset retirement in KFS.  \n  \n        c.    If the current value of the property is less than the University’s capitalization   \ncriteria of $5,000 or more per unit, a new University-owned asset will not be established in KFS. The custodial department shall immediately remove the University asset tag and the red federal property tag, if applicable, from the property.  \n  \n        d.    If the current value of the property is $5,000 or more per unit and has a useful life of more than one year, a new University-owned asset will be established in KFS by PFMO. The asset will be established at the current value and depreciation will begin to be calculated and posted.  The property will retain the same University asset tag and the custodial department shall immediately remove the red federal property tag, if applicable, from the property.  \n  \nB.    Retirement of Property  \n  \n    1.    General Guidelines  \n  \n        a.    Ownership of equipment and controlled property vests with either the   \nUniversity or the sponsor of an award.  It is the responsibility of the PI or asset representative to obtain the appropriate approvals and documentation required to facilitate the retirement of property.  \n  \n        b.    Prior to the retirement of property, the program should first determine if the item has potential for use by another University department.  If it is determined that the cost to restore the asset is impractical or no other department has use for such item, an asset retirement e-Doc may be initiated.  \n  \n        c.    Property with no further use or value shall be retired only when the   \nappropriate documentation and approvals have been obtained and the asset retirement e-Doc has been approved by PFMO.    \n  \n        d.    Equipment and controlled property shall not be disposed, destroyed, donated, exchanged, traded-in, transferred out of the University or salvaged for parts, without prior approval from PFMO.  \n  \n        e.    In general, the asset condition shall be updated from “good” or “excellent” prior to processing an asset retirement e-Doc. It is not necessary to update the asset condition for lost/missing property or for stolen property.  Upon PFMO approval of the asset condition change, the custodial department shall process an asset retirement.  \n  \n        f.    For federally-owned and agency-owned property, the University is   \nresponsible for retiring property as directed by the extramural sponsor, and to take such action for its disposition as directed or pursuant to the terms of the contract, grant or other agreement.  The asset representative or custodial department shall submit a form PFMO-75, Request for Relief of Accountability for Non-Expendable Personal Property (Title Not Vested with University), to PFMO for extramurally-owned property that is damaged beyond economic repair, worn and unserviceable or no longer useful because of its condition.  PFMO will use the information on the form PFMO-75 to request disposition instructions from the extramural sponsor.  \n  \n        g.    The proposed method of disposal shall be annotated on the asset retirement (i.e., dispose by destruction, eWaste, salvage for parts, trade-in, exchange, gift or donation, transfer out, sale, etc.).    \n  \n            (1)    The individual, by annotating the proposed method of disposal, will be   \nresponsible for ensuring that the equipment is disposed in the proposed manner and that said property will not be directed or converted into improper use.  Further, any mark, decal or tag indicating University ownership will be removed.   \n  \n            (2)    If property is disposed by destruction or salvaged for parts, the property should be destroyed in such a manner as to prevent reuse by other parties.  \n  \n    2.    Disposal by Destruction  \n  \n        a.

This form shall also be filed for University-owned property damaged or lost in a disaster or other casualty (i.e., flood, hurricane, fire, earthquake, etc.). The Form RMP-001 shall be attached as a supporting document to the KFS asset retirement.  PFMO will forward a copy of the Form RMP-001 to the University’s Office of Risk management (ORM) as appropriate.  \n      \n            (2)    Custodial departments shall follow the procedures for filing loss property insurance claims established by the University’s ORM which can be found at https://www.hawaii.edu/riskmanagement.  The State of Hawaiʻi, Department of Accounting and General Services, Risk Management Office, will determine if the loss shall be covered under the State insurance policy.  \n  \n        c.

Purpose To establish consistency in cost accounting for the University’s terminal vacation payouts and to describe the process of terminal vacation payout and fringe benefit rate.\nII. Definitions A. Terminal vacation payout fringe benefit rate – A single fringe benefit rate calculated as a percentage of payroll for all employees who accrue vacation, regardless of funding source. The rate is assessed as a portion of total fringe benefit costs.\n\nB. Terminal vacation payout – A payment for an accrued vacation balance made to a UH employee who is leaving the University because of termination, resignation, retirement, or transfer.  \n\nC. Terminal vacation payout pool – A pool account (system wide account - SW 4432920) to collect all vacation payout contributions resulting from the fringe benefit rate assessment and from which all terminal vacation payouts are made.\nIII. Administrative Procedure A. Assessment Methodology  \n\n1. Only employees who accrue vacation, regardless of funding source, are assessed the fringe benefit rate as a portion of total fringe benefit costs for contribution to the terminal vacation leave payout pool.   \n\n2. For non-imposed funds (general funds, S397, selected federal funds), each campus designates the imposed fund accounts to charge the vacation payout fringe benefit rate.  \n\n3. For all other funds (not non-imposed) the vacation payout fringe benefit rate is charged to the same account that the employee is paid on.  \n\n4. A single terminal vacation payout fringe benefit rate for the University is calculated, established, and monitored by Office of Research Services (ORS) on an annual basis.  \n\n5. Fringe benefit rate assessments collected in the University system wide account (SW 4432920) are used to make all terminal vacation payouts.  \n\nB. Payouts made from the vacation payout pool  \n\n1. The payout pool is established to pay for the following situations:  \n\na. Termination, resignation or retirement from a position at the University of Hawaii (UH) with an accrued vacation balance; or  \n\nb. Transfer from a position with vacation accrual to a non-vacation accruing position within the UH system; or  \n\nc. Transfer from a position in the UH system with vacation accrual to another State or County agency.  \n\n2. The designated preparer shall initiate the G2 Form, Application for Transfer of Vacation and Sick Leave Credit or Payment In Lieu of Vacation, obtain department head approval, and submit it to the Payroll Office for processing.    \n\nC. Processing of terminal vacation payout for an employee that transfers from or to a State or County agency.  \n\n1. For an employee that transfers from a State or County agency, the campus Fiscal Administrators (FAs) shall:   \n\na. Work with OHR and/or employee to determine the source of funds used to pay the terminal vacation and notate on the check stub.  \n\nb. If the terminal vacation payout is financed by the general fund of the State, the designated System FA will make the deposit with the State Director of Finance.  \n\nc. Send the payout received to the designated System FA for deposit and recording.  \n\n2. For an employee that transfers to a State or County agency, the campus FA is   responsible for initiating the payout request (DV – Disbursing Voucher) in the Kuali Financial System and attaching the required documentation for the transfer.  The DV will be then reviewed and approved by the designated System FA.  \n\nD. Managing the terminal vacation payout pool account  \n\n1. The designated System FA is responsible for managing the terminal vacation pool account.  Responsibilities include:  \n\na. Reconciliation of direct payments to and from other State agencies against the pool account.  \n\nb. Notifying the ORS if the pool account has excessive surplus or deficit balances at yearend.  If the surplus or deficit is excessive, a recalculation of the assessment rate may be required.  \n\n2. ORS is responsible for negotiating the terminal vacation payout fringe benefit rate with the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) annually.  The rate should be reviewed and recalculated by ORS each fiscal year to submit to DHHS for approval.    \nIV. Delegation of Authority There is no administrative specific delegation of authority.    \nV.

Purpose  To provide guidance on recording the accounting data necessary at fiscal year-end for the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accepted accounting principles.  \n  \nDuring months one (1) through twelve (12) of the fiscal year, the University generally records revenues and expenses on a cash basis.  Some revenues are recorded on an accrual basis when the departments issue accounts receivable invoices using the University’s Accounts Receivable systems (KFS A/R and CGIN).  For the presentation of the University’s fiscal year-end financial statements, however, both revenues and expenses must be recorded on the full accrual basis of accounting in accordance with Governmental Accounting and Financial Reporting Standards.  Accruals and other year-end adjustments are recorded during the thirteenth (13th) month of the fiscal year.    \nII. Definitions  Accrual basis - The basis of accounting under which revenues are recorded when earned and expenses are recorded when incurred (generally, when goods and services are received but not necessarily paid).    \nIII. Administrative Procedure  Year-end accounting data is recorded by the departmental fiscal administrator, central offices such as the General Accounting and Loan Collection office (GALC) and the Office of Research Services (ORS), and by system- generated accounting entries.  \n  \nA.  Common Transactions Recorded by Departmental Fiscal Administrators  \n  \nUse the Year-End JV Worksheets provided by GALC and attach supporting documentation showing detailed information for each journal voucher (JV).   \n  \n    1.  Unrecorded accounts receivable  \n  \nThe amount due to the University from the sale of goods or services, credit memos from vendors, and reimbursements of expenditures.  \n  \n        a.  Revenue related receivables, generated by the sale of goods and the providing of services, are billed by departments.  JVs must be prepared to record all unrecorded accounts receivable amounts if invoices were not recorded into the financial system by the close of the twelfth (12th) month.  This procedure also applies to departments using the University’s Accounts Receivable system (KFS A/R).  \n  \n        b.  Credit memos are notices from vendors stating the amounts owed to the University for various reasons, including the return of goods.  A credit memo is considered a receivable until paid by the vendor or applied at a later date to a subsequent invoice from the vendor.  \n  \n        c.  Reimbursements of expenditures (REX) are charges (expenditures) to an account which are recovered in a subsequent fiscal year.  \n  \n    For general fund accounts (UH Appropriations G011 to G3xx), monies received for a prior year expenditure shall lapse to the State general fund.  General fund REXs should be recorded using the department’s G000 account.  \n  \n    2.    Allowance for doubtful accounts  \n  \nThe portion of the accounts receivable that is not on the University’s Accounts Receivable system (KFS A/R) which is estimated to be uncollectible.  An allowance for uncollectible accounts arises when the probability of collecting on the receivable is presumed low.  Six months is considered ample time to exhaust departmental collection efforts.  Attach supporting documents showing the account code, invoice number and date, customer name, and amount.  \n  \n    3.  Unearned revenues  \n  \nRevenue collections made in the current fiscal year for services that will be rendered in the subsequent fiscal year (e.g. summer session tuition collected in June for sessions that cross fiscal years should be prorated between the two (2) fiscal years).  \n  \n    4.  Prepaid expenses  \n  \nThe amounts paid as of June 30th for goods and services which will be consumed or expended in the subsequent fiscal year (e.g. summer session expenses paid in June should be prorated between the two (2) fiscal years, or subscription paid in June for publications of the ensuing fiscal year, etc.).  \n  \n    5.  Merchandise/supplies inventory  \nThe cost of merchandise or supplies on hand as of June 30th.  Refer to Administrative Procedure AP 8.636 Supply Inventory.  \n  \n    6.  Tuition and housing waivers, scholarship discounts and allowances  \n  \nThe tuition and housing revenues for scholarship related payments and tuition waivers for the fiscal year must be recorded as contra-revenues.  Employee tuition and housing waivers must be recorded as revenues and expenses.  \n  \nB.  Common Transactions Recorded by Central Offices and System-Generated Entries  \n  \n    1.  Accrued interest receivable  \n  \nInterest accrued as of June 30th on time certificates of deposit and investments since the last interest payment date.  \n  \n    2.  Accounts payable  \n  \nA liability for amounts owed by the University for goods or services received as of June 30th.  \n  \n    3.  Accrued payroll and fringe  \n  \nA liability for wages earned by employees but not paid as of June 30th (e.g. lagged payroll, SCOPIS, etc.).  \n  \n    4.  Accrued vacation  \n  \nA liability for vacation accumulated by employees but not paid as of June 30th.  \n  \n    5.  Accrued ORS contracts and grants receivables  \n  \nORS contracts and grants receivable accruals record unbilled contracts and grants revenue and should be generated after all related expense accruals are recorded to ensure completeness.  \n  \n    6.  Allowance for doubtful accounts for KFS A/R and contracts and grants invoices  \n  \nIf accounts receivable invoices are created through the University’s Accounts Receivable systems (KFS A/R and CGIN), GALC and ORS will produce the “Allowance for Doubtful Accounts” entries.  \n  \nFor ORS project accounts, the allowance for doubtful accounts is comprised of all receivable balances for awards with stop dates in prior fiscal years, plus receivable balances, if any, for awards with stop dates in the current fiscal year that have been determined to be unrecoverable.  \n  \n    7.  Non-imposed fringe  \n  \nEmployer’s share of fringe costs that are absorbed by the State for General Funds (Gxxxxx), certain Special Funds (S397xx), Federal Work Study Programs (F223xx), Federal USDA Direct Appropriations (F26x & F27x), and other non-imposed federal programs (F230).  \n  \n    8.  Reclassification of negative accounts receivable  \n  \nNegative accounts receivable for sponsored projects are reclassified as advance from sponsors.  \n  \n    9.  Elimination of internal service transactions  \n  \nInternal service funds are used to account for the financing of goods or services provided by one program or department to other programs/departments of the University.  The charge or fee is determined on a cost-reimbursement basis.  The internal service fund is set up primarily for the University’s benefit as an economic and efficient alternative to purchasing the goods or services independently by each department from external vendors.  The elimination entry would remove the “doubling” up effect of expenses recorded by both the provider and user of the internal service.  Revenues of the provider would reduce the appropriate expenses such that allocated (reimbursed) expenses are reported only once on the University’s financial statements.    \nIV.

Purpose 1. The following guidelines outline the academic program approval and termination process from authorization to plan through established status.  Chancellors/Provost will develop procedures to implement this policy as required for their campus. \n2. The objectives of the executive policy are: 1. To establish guidelines and procedures for the preparation and processing of authorizations to plan, proposals for new academic programs, and reviews of provisional programs. 2. To assure the administration and Board of Regents of the academic and fiscal soundness of proposed and provisional programs and their appropriateness to both University-wide and campus missions. 3. To assure the administration and the Board of Regents that provisions for adequate physical facilities for the programs have been included in campus long-range development plans. 4. To assure the administration and the Board of Regents that program offerings are aligned across the system, duplication is strategic and intentional, and curricular pathways exist. 5. To assure the administration and the Board of Regents that provisions for meaningful assessment of student learning have been included in proposals for new academic programs and reviews of provisional programs.\nII. Definitions Definitions of all degrees and certificates offered by the University of Hawai‘i System are provided in EP 5.205.  1. Program  1. For purposes of Board of Regents approval, an academic program is any sequence of courses or instructional activities required to complete a specific degree, inclusive of required coursework within the major, concentration/specialization, and minor. 2. Authorization to Plan (ATP)  1. An authorization to plan is a request to authorize planning for a new academic program made to the UH Officers at the beginning of the formal program planning process before resources are committed. 3. Provisional Program  1. New programs shall be considered provisional during the period of their first full cycle. A cycle is 150% of the proposed length for baccalaureate and graduate degrees and up to 300% for certificates and associate degrees. At the end of the cycle, provisional programs are eligible to become established. 4. Established Program  1. Are permanent programs that must undergo periodic comprehensive review. 5. Termination  1. Programs that are terminated are removed from the official list of degrees and certificates. 6. Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP)  1. The Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) provides a taxonomic scheme that supports the accurate tracking and reporting of fields of study and program completions activity. CIP was originally developed by the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) in 1980, with revisions occurring regularly. 2. Each program CIP code is aligned to the NCES CIP title (when possible) and definition and is used for reporting of programs to the NCES. 3. A CIP code and title generally apply to all levels of certificates and degrees. 7. Official Program Name  1. The name of the program, including parenthetical information, is approved by the Board of Regents at the time of program establishment. It is the official name for purposes of Board of Regents-conferred credentials and is used in University publications. 8. Significant Change  A major modification or expansion of the nature of an academic program, including content, objective, or goals. 9. Significant Resources  1. As defined in RP 5.201, significant resources includes one or more of the following:  new faculty or staff positions, new facilities including lab or office space, and/or new operating costs that must be requested through a new budget request to the board and/or Legislature.  This would not include situations in which resources can be internally reallocated from other units in the college, department, division, or school in the context of reprioritizing programs and services.\nIII. Executive Policy 1. As described in RP 5.201, the Board approval is required for all new instructional programs granting academic credit leading to a degree or credential, upon recommendation by the President with the exception of those in B, C and D below.  The President can then delegate approval as outlined in B, C and D. 2. Credentials listed below can be approved by the President or designee if the program does not require significant resources:  1. An established program which desires to change to or add a new type of degree (e.g. BA to BS, AS in xx to AS in zz) with minimal change to degree requirements. 3. Approval of credentials listed below may be delegated to the Vice President for Community Colleges (VPCC) or Vice President for Academic Strategy (VPAS) if the program does not require significant resources:  1. All new stand-alone certificates of competence or academic subject certificates. 2. A stand-alone certificate where the existing Board-approved associate degree or certificate of achievement is being terminated. 4. Credentials listed below may be delegated to the Chancellor or Provost if the program does not require significant resources:  1. New minors, concentrations or certificates consisting of courses within or among existing Board-approved instructional programs. 2. A stand-alone minor where the existing Board-approved major is being terminated. 5. Program Name  1. The name of the program, including parenthetical information, and the Classification of Instructional Property (CIP) code approved by the Board of Regents at the time of program establishment becomes the Official Program Name and CIP code for purposes of Board of Regents-conferred credentials and is used in University publications. 2. Program names and CIP codes should align with titles, descriptions and CIP codes for similar programs in the national database and should be consistent across campuses unless the program name is unique to our system or there is a documented reason for the difference. The Office of the Vice President for Academic Strategy (OVPAS) must approve program names and CIP codes not aligned with the national standard or across the institution. A Master List of Board of Regents-authorized degree and certificate programs, and programs approved by the President or Chancellor/Provost, is maintained by the Office of the Vice President for Academic Strategy. 3. Requests to change the Official Program Name in order to maintain currency in terminology and which involve no substantive change in the program are made to the President. Upon approval, such changes are reported to the Board of Regents as an information item. 4. Official Program Name changes that reflect a substantive program change are handled according to the requirements for new program authorizations as outlined in this policy. 5. Any program name change must be aligned with the correct Classification of Instructional Property (CIP) code and title. 6. No program shall be given a name to honor a person without approval of the Board. 6. Authorization To Plan (ATP)  1. The purposes of the ATP are to:  1. Coordinate academic program planning actions. 2. Request approval from administrators to proceed with planning. 3. Inform the administration of long-term academic program planning intentions; the long-term physical facilities requirements of planned programs; and provide opportunities for appropriate feedback. 2. Guidelines for the ATP process are developed by the Office of the Vice President for Academic Strategy in consultation with the Council of Chief Academic Officers (CCAO). Guidelines for the ATP can be found in Appendix A. 3. ATPs are evaluated by the Officers as to fit with the mission of the unit, relationship to existing programs on each campus and in the UH system, and reasonableness of the proposed plan. Approval of the proposal authorizes a campus to proceed with planning and developing a formal proposal for the program. 4. After the Officers approve, ATPs are reviewed by CCAO who provide feedback to the proposing campus. 5. Faculty senates will be informed of approved ATPs. 7. Proposal for New Academic Programs  1. A program proposal sets forth the description of, and justification for, new academic programs sought by the campuses. 2. The proposal must contain sufficient information to permit assessment of the academic integrity and quality of the program, to determine its fiscal soundness and efficiency relative to other University activities, and to determine its appropriateness to the mission of the University and the campus. See Appendix B for guidelines for preparing the proposal. 3. The proposal must have an appropriate CIP code approved by the OVPAS. 4. Procedures and Processing    1. Each unit establishes internal procedures for the preparation and processing of new program proposals, ensuring appropriate faculty (including faculty senate review where required by internal procedures) and student input and attention to the questions outlined in Appendix B. 2. Program proposals are reviewed by the Council of Chief Academic Officers (CCAO) for feedback on the content and scope of the proposal, academic integrity, and relationship with programs on each campus and offered by other campuses to ensure program differentiation. 3. Proposals endorsed by CCAO as ready to move forward for approval are submitted to the President by the campus. 4. The Office of the President reviews the proposal and (if approved), the program name and CIP code are approved by the OVPAS. 5. The proposal is then sent to the Board of Regents with a recommendation for approval as provisional. 8. Provisional Programs  1. All programs approved by the Board of Regents are placed on provisional status during their first cycle of operation. 2. No tenure appointments shall be made in new programs until the Board of Regents has reviewed the provisional cycle and elected to continue the program. Resources for newly approved academic programs are sought in accordance with standard budgetary policies and procedures. 3. Each provisional program shall undergo a comprehensive review at the end of its first full cycle. The review shall examine the program’s actual achievement of its proposed enrollment, completion, resource use, impact, and role in the curriculum. 4. A review cycle is 150% of the proposed length of the degree for baccalaureate and graduate degrees and up to 300% for certificates and associate degrees and master’s degrees. 5. The review cycle schedule will be:  1. The review is due in 3 years for a 1-year certificate. 2. The review is due in 6 years for a 2-year associate’s degree. 3. The review is due in 6 years for a 4-year bachelor’s degree. 4. The review is due in 6 years for a 2-year master’s degree. 5. The review period for a Ph.D. shall be 150% of the expected time to completion established on approval of provisional status. 6. Chancellors/Provost establish procedures for the preparation, review, and approval of provisional programs within their units ensuring appropriate faculty and student input. 9. Proposal to Establish a Program   1. A proposal to the Board for “established” status of a provisional program shall be submitted in the academic year following the end of the program’s first full cycle. The first year of a program is considered the academic year in which students first declare a major in the degree or certificate. 2. The provisional to established proposal is outlined in Appendix C. The proposal to established status should summarize and reflect on the program review, the self-study of the provisional program, and the quantitative indicators included in Appendix C. 3. The proposal shall be based upon and summarize the comprehensive review of the program. 4. Campuses may request, and the President or designee may grant, an extension for one year for provisional programs. 5. The provisional to established proposal is brought to CCAO for comment and endorsement. 6. The Chancellor/Provost then transmits the proposal for established status to the President for approval by the Board via an action memo that summarizes:   1. A statement of program objectives. Differences between the final program objectives and those found in the program proposal should be explained. 2. An assessment of whether or not the program is meeting its objectives and a summary of the evidence used to reach this conclusion. 3. A discussion of any substantial changes made in the program since its approval and any substantial discrepancies in program indicators or activities from those identified in the program proposal. 4. A projection of resource needs for the next five years. 10. Program Stop-Outs and Terminations  1. Degree programs may be stopped out by the Chancellor/Provost based on the criteria in item III.J.4. Degree programs may be terminated by the President based on criteria in item III.J.5. Termination of all certificates and stand-alone minors may be approved by the Chancellor/Provost. 2. A program stop-out indicates the program is no longer accepting new students. A stopped out program is noted as stopped out, but it is not removed from the UH System official list of degrees and certificates offered. 3. A terminated program is no longer accepting new students, and it is removed from the official list of degrees and certificates. A program scheduled for termination should generally be preceded by a stop-out period that provides time for students currently in the program to graduate. 4. A degree program may be stopped out by the Chancellor/Provost if one of the following criteria applies:  1. It is scheduled for termination and requires a period to teach out existing students in the program; 2. It is undergoing curriculum redesign with the intention to continue the program after a temporary stop-out; 3. It is listed on the Programs with a Small Number of Graduates report for 5 years and stop-out is recommended as a result of a comprehensive program review. 4. It is determined to be under performing after an external review, and stop-out is recommended by either the department, the Dean, or the campus Chief Academic Officer. 5. A degree program may be terminated by the President if it meets one of the following criteria:  1. The program or Dean recommends termination; 2. It is listed on the Programs with a Small Number of Graduates report and termination is recommended as the result of a comprehensive program review; 3. Recommended for termination by the Chancellor/Provost to the President; 4. It is determined to be under performing after an external review and termination is recommended.\nIV. Delegation of Authority  The President delegates approval of all certificates and minors described above where a previously Board-approved degree program exists to the Chancellor/Provost.  The President delegates the approval of all stand-alone certificates of competence at the community colleges to the Vice President for Community Colleges and at the 4-year campuses to the Vice President for Academic Strategy.    \nV.

    "text": "Executive Policy 7.302\n\nTitle  Chosen Name, Pronouns, and Gender Identity    \nHeader  Executive Policy Chapter 7, Student Affairs  \nExecutive Policy [EP 7.302](https://www.hawaii.edu/policy?action=viewPolicy&policySection=Ep&policyChapter=7&policyNumber=302), Chosen Name, Pronouns, and Gender Identity  \nEffective Date:  August 2025  \nPrior Dates Amended:  August 2016  \nResponsible Office:  Office of the Vice President for Academic Strategy  \nGoverning Board of Regents Policy [RP 1.205](https://www.hawaii.edu/policy?action=viewPolicy&policySection=Rp&policyChapter=1&policyNumber=205), Policy on Nondiscrimination and Affirmative Action  \nReview Date:  August 2028    \nI. Purpose 1. To support students who have a chosen name, such as a Hawaiian name, a name that is concurrent with their gender identity, or a name they prefer to be referred by.\n  \n2. To enable a consistent chosen name experience across the University of Hawai‘i system (UH) and use of one’s chosen name wherever legal name is not absolutely necessary, including within specific information systems and processes.\n  \n3. The option to use chosen name, pronouns, and gender identity shall be available to all students as long as the use of the chosen name is not for purposes of misrepresentation.\n  \nII. Definitions 1. Chosen name: The first name that a student chooses to be known by or identifies as in the University of Hawai‘i community that is different from the student’s legal name.\n  \n2. Legal name: The name listed as a student’s name of record on official government-issued documents such as birth certificate, passport, social security card, transcript, etc.\n  \n3. Legal sex: Also referred to as ‘assigned sex’, is the assignment and classification of people as male, female, intersex, or another sex assigned at birth often based on the physical anatomy at birth and/or karyotyping.\n  \n4. Pronouns: How an individual is identified apart from their name and affirms their gender identity, not their assigned or legal sex. Examples of common pronouns include: he/him/his, she/her/hers, and they/them/theirs.\n  \n5. Gender identity: A term to describe the gender that an individual identifies with, which may or may not align with their legal/assigned sex. For the purposes of this policy, options shall be consistent with current terminology as vetted by the UH System Commission on Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer+ (LGBTQ+) Equality.\n  \nIII. Executive Policy 1. As an inclusive and diverse university system, UH recognizes that many members of its community use names other than their legal name or name of record to identify themselves. For some students, chosen names and pronouns are an important component of their identity. This policy affirms a commitment to allow students to indicate their chosen first name, pronouns, and gender identity.\n  \n1. UH shall permit the use of a chosen name, pronouns, and gender identity by any students who choose to identify themselves within the University’s information systems whenever those systems allow for such designation.\n  \n2. Chosen name, pronouns, and gender identity are used solely for UH’s internal activities, systems, processes, and practices. External systems (i.e., newspapers, outside agencies, etc.) are not affected by this policy.\n  \n3. It is further understood that chosen name, pronouns, and gender identity may be used in UH communications and reporting. These systems and reports include, but are not limited to class rosters, the learning management system, student information system, student ID cards, and directory listings.\n  \n4. As a diploma is a ceremonial document rather than a legal one, students may elect to have their chosen name on their diploma at the time the student applies to graduate.   \n\n1. Students may elect to use their chosen name on their diploma and/or the commencement book by completing the procedure at their home campus.\n  \n2. If students do not indicate the use of chosen name on their diploma and/or the commencement book by the home campus’s deadline to apply, their legal name will be used by default.\n  \n3. Students should select carefully between their legal and chosen name, keeping in mind that some countries, states, professional programs, and regulatory entities require legal names to be printed on diplomas for identity matching and/or degree verification purposes. Those entities may not accept a diploma with a chosen name as an official document.\n  \n4. The use of chosen name on a diploma does not replace the process to change a student’s legal name.\n  \n5. The registrars at the ten campuses are responsible for implementing the procedures necessary for the use of chosen name on diplomas and the commencement book, including informing students of the implications that might arise if the name of the diploma differs from the student’s legal name.\n  \n5. Legal name shall be used when necessitated by University business or legal requirement. These documents and processes include, but are not limited to admissions letters, visa documentation, verification of enrollment/degree, student accounts, financial aid, official transcripts, and communications with external authorities.\n  \n6. UH departments will commit to utilize chosen name, pronouns, and gender identity in their business practices.\n  \n7. This policy is limited to pronouns, gender identity and first names. This policy does not apply to surnames or family names.\n    \n2. Students may enter a chosen name, pronouns, and/or gender identity using the appropriate form at their home campus.\n  \n3. Students with a chosen name would be allowed to change their UH Username as an exception, per the procedures documented at https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1788\n  \n4. Students who wish to change their surname and/or official name of record must submit official documentation (e.g., court order, divorce decree) directly to their campus Registrar’s Office or Admissions and Records Office.\n  \n5. UH will display chosen name, pronouns, and gender identity to the UH community where feasible and appropriate and make a good faith effort to update reports, documents and systems.\n  \n6. Under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), a student’s name, including chosen name, may be disclosed as “directory information” unless the student restricts disclosure by submitting a request for Non-Disclosure of Directory Information to the Registrar’s Office or Admissions and Records Office at their home campus.\n  \n7. UH reserves the right to deny or remove, with or without notice, any chosen name for misuse, including but not limited to fraud, misrepresentation, attempting to avoid legal obligation, or the use of offensive or derogatory names.\n  \n1. Should UH determine that a chosen name is in violation of this policy, the University will deny use of the chosen name. UH will notify the student within five (5) working days of its determination.\n  \n2. Appeals shall be submitted in writing to the appropriate campus vice chancellor, vice provost, or dean’s office within five (5) working days of the decision. The vice chancellor, vice provost, or dean’s office or designee, shall review the appeal and issue a decision within ten (10) working days of receipt of the appeal. Appeal decisions will be final and binding within UH.\n  \nIV. Delegation of Authority  Responsibility for implementation of this policy shall rest with the chancellor/provost of each campus and is further delegated to the campus senior student affairs officer.    \nV.

Purpose To establish procedures for setting course fees for credit programs and/or courses that are entrepreneurial in nature, delivered via telecommunication methods, or otherwise contracted in accordance with Board of Regents Policy RP 6.202.\nII. Definitions No policy specific or unique definitions apply.\nIII. Executive Policy A. Introduction\nThis executive policy directs implementation of Board of Regents Policy RP 6.202 relating to contracted and telecommunication course/program fees which delegates to the President the authority to set course fees for credit programs and/or courses that are entrepreneurial in nature, delivered via telecommunication methods, or otherwise contracted. This executive policy provides guidelines to implement this delegation.\n\nNon-credit instruction delivered in-state or out-of-state is not encompassed by this policy. Charges for non-credit instruction are promulgated in Board of Regents Policy RP 6.203, item “c.(4)” Commercial Enterprises & Other Self-Supporting Operations, and further delineated in Board of Regents Policy, RP 6.203, Attachment 1, item #7.\n\nB. Policy Guidelines\nIn general, special course/program fees requested under this authorization should meet the test of positioning the University of Hawai‘i to act quickly and charge market-sensitive fees for credit instruction offered to special populations. Other guidelines include the following:\n\n1. The proposed fee applies to courses or a program to be delivered in in-state or out-of-state under special request, agreement, or contractual arrangement to a select audience and/or to a select site. Examples may include a series of credit courses and/or an entire degree program in which enrollment is limited to employees of a specific private organization (e.g., a particular hospital, bank, school, community group, etc.) or to a specific jurisdiction outside Hawai‘i.\n\n2. The proposed fee applies to credit courses and/or programs offered outside Hawai‘i and delivered on-site or by telecommunications.\n\n3. Proposed credit course fees should reflect cost recovery unless a specific general fund subsidy is available. The proposed fee always includes applicable resident tuition and may reflect additional instructional and course or program costs such as the following:\n\na. Salary of faculty or other professionals providing instruction or service; honoraria for resource people and professionals;\n\nb. Program and course development costs;\n\nc. Costs associated with telecommunications delivery;\n\nd. Student support service costs (e.g., registration, record keeping and reporting, financial assistance, etc.);\n\ne. Academic support costs (e.g., library, advising, mentoring, counseling, etc.);\n\nf. Institutional support including general administration and technology costs (e.g., promotional brochures, mailing, and advertising; cashiering and accounting; computers, telecommunications technology, and transmission costs; etc.);\n\ng. Facilities costs;\n\nh. Other costs required to deliver the course/program.\n\n4. For courses and programs offered outside of Hawai‘i, the combination of resident tuition and the course fee applies instead of nonresident tuition.\n\n5. The credit courses and/or programs for which special fees are requested are established in accordance with campus requirements directing course approval and Board of Regents requirements directing the establishment of new degree programs (see Executive Policy EP 5.201 Approval of New Academic Programs and Review of Provisional Academic Programs). Further, courses and programs delivered across geographical distances or through innovative delivery methods may require prior approval by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges.\n\n6. The special credit course/program fees permitted within this policy do not replace nor supplement Board of Regents approved tuition schedules for general student populations. For example, a universal charge applicable to all regular students majoring or enrolling in a field of study is not within the scope of the delegation set forth in BOR Policy RP6.202. Requests for such program-specific tuition schedules (e.g., Law, Medical, or Nursing Schools) must be proposed and established in accordance with Board and Executive Policy directing tuition setting for the general student body (see Board of Regents Policy RP 6.201, 6.202, and Executive Policy EP 6.202 Tuition Setting Procedures). Also, student and related special service fees and charges established within the authority of Board of Regents Policy RP 6.203 are requested and authorized separately.\n\nC. Format For Requesting Special Credit Course/Program Fees\nRequests for the special fees outlined above are forwarded through usual line campus officers (provosts/deans, and senior vice presidents) for final approval by the President. Proposals should include at least the following information:\n\n1. Department/Program/College requesting the fee.\n\n2. The target student population.\n\n3. The total fee requested including a breakdown for resident tuition and additional fees.\n\n4. The date at which and duration for which the fee will be activated.\n\n5. A description of the course/program to which the special fee will apply and a statement of the intended use of the special fee revenues.\n\n6. Any memorandum of understanding, contract, or agreement established by the date of the special fee request submission or drafts of such documents intended to be arranged thereafter should be provided as supporting documents.\n\nD. Reporting\n\nThe major University Units (UH Manoa, UH Hilo, UH-West O'ahu, and the UH Community Colleges) forward to the President by July 1 of each year a report on the headcount enrollment of students served in courses or programs for which special fees were requested and established, the location of the course/programs, and overall revenues received.\nIV. Delegation of Authority There is no policy specific delegation of authority.\nV.

Purpose To define centers and provide a consistent structure for their approval and review, this policy is established to implement Board of Regents Bylaws and Policies\nII. Definitions Centers are umbrella organizational entities that focus efforts, usually multi-disciplinary in nature, to meet special needs or deal with current issues. Often centers serve as focal points to emphasize a strategic thrust of a college, school, or department.\n\nCenters covered by this policy operate at an organizational level below that of a school or college. This policy does not apply to the establishment of organized research units (see EP 5.213), University Centers for distance education (see EP 5.204), or academic programs involving conferral of academic credentials (see EP 5.201), all of which are governed by other Board of Regents’ policies.\nIII. Executive Policy The University of Hawai‘i has evolved numerous institutes, centers, offices, non- instructional programs and similar entities. Their purposes and characteristics vary considerably, ranging from small “letterhead” groups that give identity to an interdisciplinary purpose to large enterprises that involve major staffing and space commitments. In order to define centers and provide a consistent structure for their approval and review, this policy is established to implement Board of Regents Bylaws and Policies, RP 5.206.\n\nFor the remainder of this document, the term “center” will be used to designate these entities.\n\nA. Types of centers. Based on their primary purpose, centers fall into one of the following general categories.\n\n1. Instruction or research centers have as a major focus activities related to the instruction of students or the conduct of research.\n\n2. Public service centers have as a major focus patient care or activities related to the dissemination of information or the provision of service to the community.\n\n3. Administrative service centers have as a major focus provision of student or institutional support services designed to carry out the administration and management of campuses and/or the system as a whole.\n\nB. Authorization to Establish Centers. As established in Board of Regents’ policy RP 5.206, instructional, research, administrative or public service centers require Board of Regents approval when: (1) the center requires significant current or future commitments of institutional funding, personnel or physical resources, a substantive change in program mission, and/or involve major institutional liability; (2) the proposed center involves Board or Presidential agreements with external governmental or private entities; or (3) the proposed center involves an honorific name in the designation of the center.\n\nAuthorization for centers that do not meet the above criteria is delegated to each, Vice President, Chancellor, System-wide Director, and the State Director for Career and Technical Education within their respective units or offices. This authorization may be further delegated.\n\nAll centers affiliated with or operating under the auspices of the University of Hawai‘i are subject to the authorization requirements of this policy. Centers that house permanent positions may also be subject to the requirements of Administrative Procedures A3.101 University of Hawai‘i Organizational and Functional Changes.\n\nC. Authorization to Discontinue Centers. Those centers established by the Board of Regents may be discontinued only by action of the Board of Regents. Other centers may be discontinued at the level at which they are approved. Centers that appear on an organizational chart must follow the procedures of Administrative Policy A3.101.\nIV. Delegation of Authority There is no policy specific delegation of authority.\nV.

Purpose To describe the roles, functions, duties, compensation, selection processes and qualifications for Department Chairs, Special Program Directors and Chairs of Academic Subdivisions, and Cooperating Teachings/Counselors and Observation/Participation Teachers.\nII. Definitions No policy specific or unique definitions apply.\nIII. Executive Policy A. Responsibility\n\nIt shall be the responsibility of the President to promulgate a policy in consultation with University executives setting forth the duties, responsibilities, qualifications, guidelines and timelines for selection, conditions for appointment, compensation and other administrative requirements for the following Board of Regents appointees Department Chairs, Special Program Directors and Chairs of Academic Subdivisions, Graduate Assistants, Lecturers, and Cooperating Teachers/Counselors and Observation/Participation Teachers.\n\nB. Guidelines\n\n1. Department Chairperson\n\na. The chair is responsible to the dean of the college for the following functions as they apply to the department: providing the courses required by the curricula of the various colleges; preparation of the department budget; expenditure of funds allocated to the department; recommendations for reappointments and for appointments to unfilled positions; recommendations for promotions; rating of faculty members not on permanent tenure; assignment of courses and proper departmental balance of teaching load; textbook orders; supervision of instruction; direction of graduate assistants; assistance with registration during both the academic year and the summer session; improvement of instruction and encouragement of research; implementing University rules limiting \"overload\" teaching and other compensated work.\n\nb. In some colleges, some or all of these functions are consolidated in the office of the Dean.\n\nc. Under the leadership of the Dean of the College, the department chair meet periodically to consider matters of common concern.\n\nd. Appointment of a department chair at the University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa shall be made in accordance with the following procedure\n\ne. Only persons with the rank of associate professor or of professor are normally eligible for the chair. If no one in these ranks is available, a member of a lower rank, or some appropriate person elsewhere in the College, is appointed as acting chair.\n\nf. After receiving suggestions from the college dean (following the latter's consultation with members of the department), the Chancellor appoints one member of each instructional department as department chair with the concurrence of the President and the Board of Regents.\n\ng. The deans' consultation with faculty members prior to recommendations on department chair may take a variety of forms depending upon such factors as the size of department, formal structure and internal relationships. Whatever form it takes, however, it should be comprehensive and effective, so the dean has the benefit of the advice of each member of the department in Rank 3 or above and those of Rank 2 with tenure. When written nominations are used, these are not to be construed as votes, since the majority opinion is not the only factor the dean must consider in selecting the persons he/she considers most likely to lead the department most effectively. When there is serious or widespread disagreement among the members of a department as to which person should be chair, or when the dean does not accede to the prevailing view expressed by a department, the dean shall include with his/her own recommendation to the Chancellor a written statement setting out the dissenting viewpoints and his/her analysis of the situation.\n\nh. Appointments are usually announced in the early spring. Department chair are normally appointed for three-year terms, although appointments for shorter terms are made when necessary. Reappointment of a chair at the end of a term, as the appointment of a new chair, is preceded by a dean's consultation with faculty members as set forth above.\n\ni. Faculty personnel appointed to serve as department chair may receive additional compensation in the form of released time from regular faculty responsibilities and/or change from 9 to 11-month appointments and/or monthly stipends. The specific amount of the stipend is determined by the size and complexity of the department.\n\n2. Special Program Directors and Chairs of Academic Subdivisions\n\na. Faculty personnel may be assigned extra administrative duties and responsibilities wherein the administrative function is not primary or not permanent.\n\nb. Faculty personnel serving in these capacities may receive additional compensation in the form of released time from regular faculty responsibilities and/or change from 9 to 11-month appointments and/or monthly stipends.\n\nc. The specific amount of the stipend is determined by the size and complexity of the department, program, or institute and the nature of the administrative duties.\n\n3. Cooperating Teachers/Counselors and Observation/Participation Teachers.\n\nThe President or his/her designee shall have authority to appoint cooperating teachers/counselors and observation/participation teachers in accordance with the following guidelines:\n\na. Teacher preparation candidates must undergo at least one semester of practice teaching as part of their pre-service training.\n\nb. Counseling & Guidance students must participate in a practicum for at least one semester as part of their pre-service training.\n\n(1) The practicum may be completed within the University of Hawai‘i or in other educational institutions or under the supervision of private practitioners.\n\nc. The cooperating teachers/counselors and observation/participation teachers who participate in these programs observe, supervise, advise students on performance and finally evaluate the students.\n\n(1) The cooperating personnel are professional people established in the communities and are expected to be full-time teachers or practitioners.\n\nd. The appropriate Dean or Director of an educator preparation program may appoint cooperating personnel subject to the following conditions:\n\n(1) The Dean or Director will ensure that each person appointed meets the professional standards required by the College.\n\n(2) Appointments may be for one semester at a time or for the academic year if the requirement is evident.\n\n(3) Cooperating personnel may be paid a stipend which is to be determined by the President or the President’s designee.\n\n(4) Such appointments are part-time and temporary in nature and any indication of continued employment is not intended or implied.\nIV. Delegation of Authority In accordance with Board of Regents Policy RP 9.201, the President or designee shall have the authority to make appointments that conform to policy.\nV.

Purpose  To (1) define Organized Research Units, (2) to describe their purpose, administration, scope, funding, and faculty, and (3) to acknowledge certain exemptions from some of the policy's aspects for certain units.    \nII. Definitions  An Organized Research Unit (ORU) is a Board of Regents approved, extradepartmental administrative structure which provides a locus for faculty, staff, and students to engage in focused, collaborative research and training activities. Organized Research Units exist at the level of a School or College (Level V) and are supported in part by the Organized Research Budget (UOH-102).    \nIII. Executive Policy  Authority for the establishment and termination of Organized Research Units (ORUs) is vested solely in the Board of Regents of the University of Hawai‘i, acting upon the recommendation of the President after appropriate review and recommendations by the relevant faculty senate and administrative officers. No ORU may be formally established until review as prescribed by the President has been completed. Once established, an ORU will be reviewed periodically at intervals of five years or less, in conformance with Board of Regents' Bylaws and Policies. The Board of Regents' policy on the establishment and review of ORUs is supplemented by the Executive Policy promulgated in the ensuing paragraphs.  \nA.    PURPOSE  \n  \n1.    ORUs are established to advance the University's research and training mission. They foster and support interdisciplinary faculty research activities, and they assist undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate    \nstudents by giving them access to research opportunities, facilities, and equipment. ORUs benefit the State of Hawai‘i directly through programs of applied research, extension service, and training in areas which meet community and regional human and economic needs. ORUs provide an efficient, visible, and effective means of pooling appropriate expertise, equipment, and management resources.  \n  \nB.    ADMINISTRATION  \n  \n1.    The chief executive officer of an ORU must be a tenured member of the faculty, unless some other arrangement is specifically authorized by the President. ORU Directors who hold Executive/Managerial positions are analogous to Deans of academic schools and colleges, and they are excluded from an appropriate bargaining unit. The terms of their service, including appointment by the Board of Regents upon recommendation by the President, are specified in the Board of Regents Bylaws and Policies on Executive/Managerial Personnel [Appendix 9-14]. ORU Directors who hold faculty appointments are analogous to Chairs of academic departments in that they may be included in an appropriate bargaining unit. Faculty Directors are appointed by the Vice President for Research and Graduate Education. Faculty Directors serve at the pleasure of the University and, like Excluded Directors with return rights, they are appointed for one year at a time.  \n  \nC.    SCOPE  \n  \n1.    Most ORUs are interdisciplinary in scope, involving faculty, staff, and students from two or more areas of instruction and research. There are some, however, which focus on a single field of study and exist as separate entities in part because they are larger and administratively more complex than the associated academic department(s) or program(s). ORUs are normally established and maintained only in areas where the University has intrinsic research advantages or particular capabilities to respond to special needs. Such advantages and capabilities are considered long-term. No ORU will be established or maintained if its goals are short-term, if its objectives are essentially the same as those of an existing department or other unit within the relevant campus, or if its objectives can be accomplished just as effectively within an existing University administrative structure.  \n  \nD.    FUNDING  \n  \n1.    Core support for an ORU is provided by State general funds through the Organized Research Budget (UOH-102). Additional support is provided by extramural funds associated with specific research and training projects undertaken by the ORU. In most cases, funding is obtained from both State and Federal sources, the ratio of external to core funding is greater than one, and more than one external funding source is involved. Private funding can also be important in certain instances. Solicitation and administration of external grants and contracts, i.e., funds other than outright gifts and apart from appropriations by the Legislature of the State of Hawai‘i, for the establishment and/or maintenance of ORUs, as well as for more informal arrangements such as consortia, offices, programs, bureaus, laboratories, and the like, must be processed through the University's Office of Research Administration and require the approval of the University's Director of Research.  \n  \nE.    FACULTY  \n  \n1.    State funding enables ORUs to be assigned permanent faculty positions. Instructional (I), Research (R), Specialist (S), and Agent (A) faculty may be employed by or affiliated with ORUs, and an ORU can serve as a locus of tenure. Fractional appointments and split appointments for faculty from other academic units are permitted in ORUs to foster interdisciplinary research and to encourage flexibility in responding to opportunities offered by external sponsors of research and training. Such appointments may be supported by a mix of State, Federal, and private funds, and faculty may be attached to more than one unit or department.  \n  \nF.    EXCEPTIONS  \n  \n1.    For historical and other reasons, certain ORUs are exempt from some aspects of the policies and procedures that apply to organized research units generally. The nature of the exemption(s) is set forth in separate documents for each unit.    \nIV. Delegation of Authority  There is no policy specific delegation of authority.    \nV.

    "text": "Executive Policy 5.204 Executive Policy 5.204 Title  Distance and Online Learning   \n\nExecutive Policy Chapter 5. Academic Affairs   Executive Policy EP 5.204, Distance and Online Learning  Effective Date:  January 2017  Dates Amended:  May 1998, June 1992, October 2014​  Responsible Office: Office of the Vice President for Academic Planning and Policy  Governing Board of Regents Policy:  RP 5.201, Instructional Programs  Review Date:  December​ 2019​   \n\nI.  Introduction  The purpose of this policy is to advance the University of Hawai‘i’s (UH) mission of extending access to higher education throughout the State of Hawai‘i, enhance educational services to UH students, and reach new constituencies throughout the world.  This executive policy is promulgated in accordance with the authority delegated to the President by the Board of Regents. The provisions of this policy are designed to carry out the intent of the Board of Regents’ policy to expand access to quality higher educational opportunities to Hawai‘i citizens (Board of Regents Bylaws and Policies, Section 5-10).  \n\nThe primary purpose for distance learning at UH is to provide increased access to post-secondary education to the residents of the State of Hawai‘i.  Distance learning is also an important enabler of the entrepreneurial goals of the University and can support the University’s mission beyond the boundaries of the State.   \n\nOnline learning is a powerful and flexible enabler of distance learning.  In addition to breaking down barriers of distance, online learning can break down barriers of time that prevent some students from attending courses on scheduled days and times.  Online learning is also an important educational element for campus-based students who may take fully online courses alongside classroom-based courses and hybrid courses that combine classroom and online activities.  Online learning can provide high-quality opportunities for individualization of learning and increased student engagement.  In addition, online learning can help UH address limited resource constraints such as classrooms and parking, can enable campuses to aggregate demand for courses for which there is insufficient enrollment to justify offerings on multiple campuses.  Online learning offers opportunities for affordably increasing high quality educational opportunities for students.  \n\nUH takes a holistic approach to distance and online learning through which we leverage and integrate our campus based practices and capabilities with our distance and online practices and capabilities.  UH distance and online courses are taught by UH faculty hired through the normal faculty processes and UH distance and online programs award regular UH campus credentials.  Distance and online learning is largely “mainstreamed” at UH, i.e., standard campus academic and administrative processes support distance and online endeavors.  The “anywhere and anytime” technologies used in distance and online education at UH also support classroom-based instruction, meetings, and collaboration among UH faculty and staff throughout the UH System and with colleagues elsewhere.  Distance and online learning may be applicable at any level and may be for credit or non-credit.   \n\nII. Guiding Principles for Distance and Online Learning                        \nThe fundamental policy principles for University of Hawai‘i distance and online learning are:  \n                      \nA. Everyone’s Responsibility:   Distance and online learning and support are an integral part of the University’s mission and a responsibility of every campus and support unit throughout the UH System. In addition, every unit on every campus needs to embrace their responsibilities to fully support and embrace distance and online learning and distance learners alongside classroom-based instruction and campus-based learners.  This includes not only instructional delivery but also academic support, student support, and administrative and other support services.  \n\nB. Quality:   Distance and online learning is first and foremost an academic endeavor. The quality and standards of distance and online instruction, whether involving synchronous or asynchronous interaction, must be comparable to those for traditional instructional programs activities with at least comparable assessment practices. Regardless of any collaborative arrangements, the responsibility for quality assurance resides firmly with the campus conferring the credit and/or credential.   \n\nC. All UH Students are “Our” Students:   UH campuses and education centers support all UH distance learning students as their own, including those matriculating at other campuses.  If a distance learning program is a joint effort among campuses, it is the responsibility of the supporting sites to provide for the legitimate needs of the students physically on their campus, notwithstanding the fact that the degree or certificate the student is pursuing will be conferred by a sister campus.    \n\nD. Collaboration:   Distance learning within the UH System is a collaborative enterprise across all aspects of the academic environment including program planning, curriculum development and delivery, student services and other support services (such as testing centers).  If needed, memoranda of agreement detail the responsibilities of originating and supporting sites including addressing specific cases in which financial support may be required from originating campuses. Collaboration with external providers may be considered when internal resources are not available to respond to demonstrated in-state needs.   \n\nE. Accreditation:   For distance learning programs within Hawai‘i campuses and support units must work together to ensure that accreditation standards are met. The responsibility for meeting accreditation standards for distance and online learning programs rests firmly with the campus bestowing the degree or certificate. Responsibility for supporting in-state distance learning students may be shared among an originating campus and other supporting sites, i.e., campuses and education centers where student may participate in synchronous interactive sessions and/or receive assistance and support.    \n\nF. Tuition and Fees:   In accord with BOR Policy [5-10(d)], distance learning credit instruction is offered in Hawai‘i at a cost to residents similar to that of regular on-campus instruction.  Special provisions of BOR Policy [6-2(g)] enable special tuition rates for distance learning programs delivered entirely by telecommunications outside the State or to specific populations, generally on an entrepreneurial or externally-supported basis.   \n\nStudents in distance and online programs need to be recognized as members of the student body of the offering campus including having access to co-curricular and fee-based services. However, distance learning students who have no opportunity to benefit from certain on-campus fees may have those fees waived or may be charged substitute fees that support unique requirements of distant learners (BOR Policy 6-3.b.2.ii).  The new Executive Policy [EP 6.208](ep6.208), recognizes the fee considerations for distance and online students.   \n\nG. Broad Technology Applicability:   When deploying technologies to support distance learning, the University strives to select and invest in technologies that have broad applicability to support campus-based learners and to general collaboration within academic communities as well.  \n\nH. Accessibility:   In accord with applicable statutes and regulations, reasonable accommodations will be made to facilitate access to UH distance learning programs and services by all qualified students with disabilities. Although distance learning often breaks down traditional barriers of time and space, technological advances may also place new and unforeseen demands on educational services and support. Originating and supporting sites, along with their respective disability service programs, will cooperate to provide appropriate auxiliary aids and services to those with documented disabilities.   \n\nI. Copyright:   The University is committed to full compliance with copyright laws in its adoption and utilization of software and content for distance and online learning.   \n\nIII.  Distance Learning Roles & Responsibilities  Effective and efficient delivery of distance and online programs across the State of Hawai‘i requires collaboration among campuses, education centers and support units.  Even fully online programs inevitably demand the support of other UH units of when enrolling students on other islands of the State.  The follow sections outline the responsibilities of units that deliver programs, units that support programs from other campuses, the UH System, and specific coordinating entities.    \n\nA. Campuses that originate programs and courses:  \n  \n1. Have primary responsibility for delivery of programs & courses and the implementation of appropriate instructional materials and methods. Each campus establishes its own internal processes for assuring the quality and integrity of all distance learning curricula and meeting all applicable accreditation requirements.   \n\n2. Commitment to all necessary support for a period sufficient to enable current students to complete their degrees/certificates.  \n\n3. Commit to providing accurate and complete information about courses and programs, including entering all course and program data into all applicable university information systems.  \n\n4. Collaborate with supporting sites regarding program plans, support needs and requirements.   \n  \n                                                                  \nB. Supporting sites:  \n  \n1. Provide information to students in their areas of responsibility who are interested and qualified for programs and courses in collaboration with the campuses offering programs.  \n\n2. Collaborate with originating campuses to ensure adequate support services to enable students to complete degrees/certificates in a timely manner.  \n\n3. University and Education Centers regularly assess community needs within their areas of responsibility and communicate the results of those assessments throughout the UH System.\n  \n\nC. System Offices:  \n  \n1. Facilitate coordination among campuses and units supporting distance learning, including the creation and convening of standing and ad-hoc working groups and advisory councils.  \n\n2. Manage the UH System technology infrastructure and services to support distance and online learning activities.  \n\n3. Disseminate information regarding applicable federal and state regulations and laws, and best practices in distance and online learning.  \n\n4. Display course, program, enrollment and related information regarding distance and online learning to communicate opportunities and activities within UH and externally.  \n\n5. Provide opportunities for system-wide faculty and staff development in distance and online learning.  \n\n6. Assist in the acquisition of resources for development of distance learning programs. \n  \n\nD. Specific Distance Learning Coordinating Entities:  \n  \nCoordination of collaborative distance learning throughout the UH System requires the active collaboration among inter-campus and cross-functional working groups and advisory councils. Establishing effective lines of communication across these “communities of practice” is essential to the University of Hawai‘i’s overall decentralized approach, mainstreamed and collaborative approach to distance learning.  \n          \n1.     Distance Learning Advisory Council (DLAC) is the lead system-wide group that helps the University of Hawai‘i advance its mission through distance and online learning.  The DLAC is responsible to recommend policies and to proactively identify and catalyze action on systemic issues as they arise.   As appropriate, the DLAC counsels University administrators and policy-makers through such groups as the Council of Chancellors, the Council of Chief Academic Officer, and the Council of Chief Student Affairs Officers.  The DLAC prepares, monitors and oversees a system-wide distance and online learning action plan that advances overall institutional plans and priorities of the UH system and the campuses (http://www.hawaii.edu/dlplan).  The DLAC is convened and chaired jointly by the offices of the Vice President for Academic Policy and Planning and Vice President for Information Technology/Chief Information Officer.  \n  \n2.     Distance Learning Program Planning Group (DLPPG) is a system-wide group composed of University and Education Centers and representation from offering units that assists campuses, departments and support units in the planning and coordination of distance and online programs to meet educational needs within the State of Hawai‘i. The DLPPG advises programs, allocates system resources, and coordinates the master listings of distance and online programs. The DLPPG is convened and chaired by the Director of Academic Technologies.  \n  \n3.     Campus Distance Coordinators (CDC) is a system-wide group that is responsible for addressing student, faculty, and staff concerns relating to distance learning at the operational level.  This group helps identify system-wide issues and raises them to the attention of the DLAC.  The CDC is convened and chaired by election from within the CDC membership.    \n\nIV.

Purpose \n                            1. To support the goal of the University of Hawaiʻi to provide a safe and welcoming place to learn and work.\n  \n                            2. To support the University’s commitment to equal access for persons with disabilities under federal and state laws and those individuals who may benefit from the presence of a Service or Emotional Support Animal, including students, employees and visitors.\n  \n                            3. To establish guidelines for the University to support the use of Service and Emotional Support Animals on campus.\n  \nII. Definitions \n                            1. **Service Animal** : Service Animals are working animals, not pets. A Service Animal is a dog1 that is individually trained to do work or perform tasks for an individual with a disability, including a physical, sensory, psychiatric, intellectual, or other mental disability. Service Animals can be trained to perform important tasks to assist individuals with disabilities, including but not limited to providing stability for a person who has difficulty walking, picking up items for a person who uses a wheelchair, performing medical alerts of various types such as high or low blood sugar, or the onset of seizures, guiding people who are blind, or alerting a person who has hearing loss when someone is approaching from behind. Service Animals can also support persons with psychiatric and neurological disabilities by helping to prevent or interrupt impulsive or self-destructive behaviors. A Service Animal does not include animals that are not trained to perform specific tasks related to the individual’s disability. Service Animals in training are not considered Service Animals under this policy.\n  \n                            2. **Emotional Support Animal** : An Emotional Support Animal (ESA) is any animal that provides necessary emotional support to an individual with a mental or psychiatric disability that alleviates one or more identified symptoms or effects of an individual with a disability. ESAs are sometimes referenced as therapy animals or comfort animals. An ESA is not a Service Animal.\n  \n                            3. **Reliable Third Party** : A Reliable Third Party is someone who is familiar with the individual’s disability and the necessity for the requested accommodation. A Reliable Third Party includes a qualified professional who provides medical care, therapy or counseling to persons with disabilities, including, but not limited to, doctors, physician assistants, psychiatrists, psychologists, or social workers.\n  \n                            4. **Research, Teaching and Training Animal** : An animal that is officially part of the University’s teaching, research, training and/or clinical programs. All vertebrate animals used for these purposes must have a valid animal protocol approved by the University of Hawaiʻi Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), unless exempted by the IACUC. This policy does not specifically address these animals.\n  \nIII. Executive Policy \n                            1. _Service Animals_\n  \nThe University of Hawaiʻi is committed to equal access for persons with disabilities, including students, employees, and visitors, in compliance with federal and state laws. Under federal and state law, Service Animals are allowed in areas where animals, including pets, are generally not permitted. Individuals with disabilities may be accompanied by Service Animals on all University of Hawaiʻi campuses and its premises where members of the public are allowed to go. A Service Animal’s work or task must be directly related to its owner’s disability.  \n  \n_Members of the Public_  \nUnder federal and state laws, individuals with disabilities are not required to provide documentation of their disability, nor are they required to provide documentation that an animal has been trained as a Service Animal. The law does not require that the animal wear any type of identifying vest or badge indicating that it is a Service Animal and it does not prohibit any particular breed of dog from being a Service Animal.  \n  \nWhen it is not readily apparent that an animal is a Service Animal, the University is only permitted to ask the following two questions:  \n  \n                               1. Is the animal required because of a disability?\n  \n                               2. What work or task has the animal been trained to perform?\n  \n_Students_  \nStudents may be accompanied by Service Animals in all locations where students are allowed, except where the presence of a Service Animal would fundamentally alter the nature of a program or an activity and/or pose a direct threat to the health and safety of others. Access to restricted areas as specified in Section D. Exclusions may be granted on a case-by-case basis by contacting the individual campus’s Disability Services Office for students2.  \n  \n_Housing and Employment_  \nWhen an individual’s disability or the need for a Service Animal is not readily apparent, an individual with a disability, who is pursuing disability-related housing accommodations or an employment accommodation, may be required to provide information to verify the disability. Documentation may be required in order to evaluate whether the requested accommodation may be necessary to provide an equal opportunity to use and enjoy University housing or to perform an employee’s essential job functions.  \n  \nStudents seeking disability-related housing accommodations must contact their campus Disability Services Office. Employees seeking disability-related housing accommodations regarding university housing must contact University Housing. University employees seeking to be accompanied by a Service Animal in their work environment must contact their Supervisor, Human Resources, and/or ADA Coordinator3 to submit a disability accommodation request. The University will process the employee’s request in the same manner as other requests for reasonable accommodations. Students should contact their campus Disability Services Office with any questions regarding reasonable accommodations.  \n  \n_Misrepresentation of a Service Animal_  \nHawaiʻi law and the University prohibit knowingly misrepresenting an animal as a Service Animal4. The law establishes a civil penalty for misrepresentation and discourages persons, including persons with a disability, from fraudulently misrepresenting their animals as Service Animals to request access when animals or pets are otherwise prohibited. Persons committing this violation may be subject to a civil fine of not less than $100 and not more than $250 for the first violation, and not less than $500 for a second violation and each violation thereafter. Employees and students of the University are subject to discipline for misrepresentation of a Service Animal.  \n  \n                            2. _Emotional Support Animals (ESAs)_\n  \nESAs may not enter University premises without an official accommodation granted in advance. Students and employees with disabilities who are seeking permission to have an ESA in their on-campus residence or in their work environment must request an accommodation that will enable them to do so. Students should register with their respective University of Hawaiʻi campus Disability Services Office and follow the accommodation process for that campus. The campus shall properly document the individual’s disability and the directly related need for the ESA.  \n  \nWhen considering accommodation requests for ESAs, University staff will only require information necessary to verify whether the individual has a disability and to evaluate whether the requested accommodation may be necessary to provide an equal opportunity to use and enjoy University housing or to perform an employee’s essential job functions. When an individual’s disability or the need for an ESA is not readily apparent, documentation may be required from a Reliable Third Party to verify that the request is necessary to provide the individual an equal opportunity to use and enjoy University housing or to enable an employee to perform essential job functions.  \n  \n_Housing_  \nESAs approved for on-campus housing accommodations may accompany the student with a disability within the student’s University housing facility in areas where the student is allowed to go. Approved ESAs are not permitted in other facilities on campus such as academic spaces or dining facilities.  \n  \n_Employment_  \nESAs approved for employment accommodations may accompany an employee in their normal work environment but are generally not allowed in other areas such as dining facilities, or in safety sensitive areas.  \n  \n                            3. _Responsibilities of Individuals with Service and Emotional Support Animals_\n  \nThe University is not responsible for the care or supervision of any animal including Service Animals or ESAs. Owners or handlers are responsible at all times for the proper control and care of their animals and/or for any damage or injury they may cause. Owners or handlers must comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including vaccination, licensure, animal health and leash laws. All animals shall be restrained with a harness, leash, or other tether, unless an individual’s disability precludes the use of a restraint or if the restraint would interfere with a Service Animal’s safe, effective performance of work or tasks. All animals must be under the individual’s control, whether by voice control, signals, or other effective means.  \n  \nIndividuals are responsible for ensuring the immediate clean-up and proper disposal of all animal waste, e.g., in an outdoor trash can. Although the University does not charge an individual with a disability a Service Animal or ESA surcharge, all costs or other liabilities associated with any damage or harm caused by any animal is the owner or handler’s responsibility.  \n  \n                            4. _Exclusions_\n  \nThe University may exclude a Service Animal or ESA in certain locations due to health or safety restrictions, where Service Animals or ESAs may be in danger, and/or where their use may fundamentally alter the nature of a program or activity. Such restricted areas may include, but are not limited to, sterile areas, food service preparation areas, moving machinery, areas with chemicals or corrosive materials, and areas with extremely hot/cold surfaces or sharp objects.  \n  \nThe University may exclude a Service Animal or ESA from campus if a particular animal behaves in a way that poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others, or has a history of such behavior. Furthermore, the University may ask an individual with a disability to remove a Service Animal or ESA from a campus or other University facilities if the animal is out of control and the individual does not take effective action to control it; or if the animal is not housebroken. In cases where the animal appears to be mistreated, the University may ask the handler to remove the Service Animal or ESA from campus, and may also contact law enforcement or other appropriate service providers. The University may require an unclean or unkempt Service Animal or ESA to be removed until the issue is resolved. In instances where the University excludes or removes a Service Animal or ESA from campus, the individual with a disability is allowed to participate in the service, program, or activity without the Service Animal or ESA.  \n  \nAccess to restricted areas may be granted on a case-by-case basis by contacting the campus Disability Services Office for students or Human Resources and/or ADA Coordinators for employees who are participating in the accommodation process.  \n  \n                            5. _Animals in Buildings, Facilities and/or Premises_\n  \nAnimals, other than Service Animals and ESAs approved by the University campus, are not allowed in any University buildings, facilities and/or premises. Individual campuses in the University of Hawaiʻi System may have varied policies or guidelines allowing animals (that are not service animals and emotional support animals) to travel on their respective campus premises. Individuals with animals must follow the respective campus policy pertaining to animals on campus. In the event that a campus does not have a policy relating to animals on campus, then this section controls.  \n  \n                            6. _Conflicting Disabilities_\n  \nStudents or employees with a health condition or disability that conflicts with or is adversely affected by exposure to a Service Animal or ESA should contact the campus Disability Services Office for students or for employees, their supervisor and/or Human Resources. The student or employee may be asked to provide documentation that identifies the impacts of their health condition to allow the campus to determine if there is a need for a reasonable accommodation.  \n  \n                            7. _University-Sponsored Events_\n  \nOn a case-by-case basis, for time-limited University sponsored events, the campus may allow animals on its premises for the therapeutic benefit of its attendees. These type of events must be approved by the Chief Executive Officer of each campus.  \n  \n                            8. _Disputes/Complaints_\n  \nThe University has internal complaint procedures for addressing complaints about the reasonable accommodation process on its campuses. For issues related to Service Animal or ESA accommodations, students may contact their campus Disability Services Office and employees may contact Human Resources and/or the Equal Employment Opportunity office.  \n  \n  \n_____  \n1 Miniature horses may also be included as Service Animals, where reasonable. See 28 CFR § 35.136(i).\n  \n2 _See_ Section V. for contact information for ADA coordinators.\n  \n3 _See_ Section V. for contact information for ADA coordinators.\n  \n4 Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes §347-2.6.\n   \nIV.

    "text": "Executive Policy 5.211\n\nTitle Grading During COVID-19 Public Health Crisis\nHeader Executive Policy Chapter 5. Academic Affairs\nExecutive Policy [EP 5.211](https://www.hawaii.edu/policy?action=viewPolicy&policySection=Ep&policyChapter=5&policyNumber=211), Grading During COVID-19 Public Health Crisis\nEffective Date: April 2020\nResponsible Office: Office of the Vice President for Academic Planning and Policy\nGoverning Board of Regents Policy: [RP 5.201](https://www.hawaii.edu/policy?action=viewPolicy&policySection=Rp&policyChapter=5&policyNumber=201), Instructional Programs\nReview Date: April 2025\nI. Purpose\n1. To address the exceptional circumstances that instructors and students are facing due to the COVID-19 pandemic which required an abrupt shift to remote teaching and student support. UH recognizes that the academic, personal, and financial situations of students, faculty, and staff have been abruptly transformed. This policy balances the disruption caused by the sudden need to move all courses online mid-semester with our usual grading standards.\n\n2. To provide students the option of selecting “Credit/No Credit (CR/NC)” grades for their courses disrupted during the Spring 2020 term.\n\nII. Definitions\n1. Credit: Indicates that the student achieved course learning objectives (or outcomes) at level of “C” or better. The student will be awarded credit. This grade will not be included in the calculation of the student’s GPA.\n\n2. No Credit: Indicates that the student did not achieve course learning objectives at level of “C” or better, _e.g.,_ C-, D, F. The student will not be granted credit for the course. This grade is not calculated in a student’s GPA.\n\nIII. Executive Policy ******\n1. Scope of policy\n1. The policy applies only to Spring 2020 courses which have end dates after Spring Break (March 20, 2020).\n\n1. For part of term courses or 5-week courses ending prior to Spring break, grades will be issued as originally assigned.\n\n2. For part of term courses or 5-week courses ending after Spring break, grades will be subject to this policy.\n\n2. The policy applies to all UH courses, undergraduate and graduate, for the disrupted Spring 2020 term.\n\n3. For programs whose professional accreditation organizations will not allow for alterations in the grading process during the COVID-19 crisis, a very limited number of exceptions from this policy may be made upon request to the President upon the recommendation of a University of Hawaiʻi Officer by April 30, 2020.\n\n4. Students who request and receive an “Incomplete” grade for a Spring 2020 course will receive the letter grade awarded by the instructor upon completion of the missing work, following the deadline in the Academic Calendar. If the course was previously approved for Credit/No Credit grading before the start of the Spring 2020 semester, the instructor will assign either a CR or NC, as appropriate.\n\n2. Process\n1. Faculty will award letter grades as usual for Spring 2020 courses by entering grades into MyUH during the grading period. Courses already established as Credit/No Credit only will continue to use those designations instead of letter grades.\n\n2. Once the faculty have entered grades, students will be able to view the usual assigned letter grades in STAR-GPS.\n\n3. At this point, a student may elect to retain the assigned grade or convert the letter grade to the Credit/No Credit option for one or more courses until May 22, 2020 at 4:00 p.m. (until May 14, 2020 at 4:00 p.m. for UH West Oʻahu courses).\n\n4. After 4:00 p.m. on May 22, 2020 (May 14, 2020 for UH West O‘ahu), registrars will make the grades final and will include a notation indicating this is a “semester disrupted by COVID-19” on student transcripts.\n\n3. Implications for Other UH System, Campus and Program Policies, Procedures and Practices\n1. Within the UH System, students will be “held harmless” by the choice to select Credit/No Credit in Spring 2020. This policy supersedes all other relevant UH System, campus policies, and requirements described in campus catalogs regarding Credit/No Credit grades or grading for Credit/No Credit grades awarded under this policy.\n\n2. Examples of policies and requirements which are superseded include but are not limited to:\n\n1. Academic probation will be extended to the following semester for any student who does not move off academic probation based on their GPA.\n\n2. An award of a “Credit” grade (C or better grade) will be recognized as meeting requirements at any campus regarding courses, majors, minors, concentrations, certificates, general education courses, electives, “back credit” (UH Mānoa only), and/or other admission or graduation requirements.\n\n3. Courses for which students received a grade of “Credit” will also be recognized as meeting any prerequisites for moving to the next course in a sequence or for transfer within the UH System.\n\n4. Credit/No Credit grades for Spring 2020 will not be counted toward any existing Credit/No Credit limits in the System.\n\n5. For the purposes of transfer within the UH System, grades of Credit taken during Spring 2020 will be accepted as meeting the criteria for general education requirements, major requirements, minors, and concentrations at any UH campus.\n\n3. Students must be able to make an informed decision about the implications of electing the Credit/No Credit option.\n\n1. Students will be provided information at the time of the announcement of the policy and at the point of selecting the Credit/No Credit option.\n\n2. Students will be strongly encouraged to meet with an advisor before deciding whether to accept a letter grade or to opt for a Credit/No Credit grade. Circumstances in which students might consider keeping letter grades include, but are not limited to:\n\n1. Students who earn a C- or D in a course and need to earn credit, _e.g.,_ to meet a general education or elective requirement.\n\n2. Students who want the grade earned calculated into GPA for any reason, _e.g.,_ eligibility for the Dean’s List, applications for certain scholarships, applications for selective admissions programs, graduate admissions or transfer outside the UH System).\n\nIV.

Purpose The University recognizes that, at times, graduate assistants may be unable to work due to personal illness or injury, to receive medical care, or due to the death of an immediate family member. Under the authority of the President, this policy outlines the administration of the graduate assistant sick and bereavement leave program.\nII. Definitions No policy-specific or unique definitions apply.\nIII. Executive Policy 1. Responsibilities The President is responsible for promulgating a policy in consultation with the University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa Graduate Division, the Graduate Student Organization, the University of Hawai‘i Hilo Office of the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Graduate Council, and the Office of Human Resources relating to graduate student sick and bereavement leave.\n2. General Provisions 1. Graduate Assistant supervisors will review and approve leave requests in the Online Leave System (OLS).\n2. Earning of Sick Leave. 1. Graduate assistants shall be advanced sick leave at the beginning of each academic semester (Spring, Summer and Fall). Sick leave advances will be determined by the graduate assistant’s 9-month or 11-month appointment. \n2. All unused sick leave hours shall be forfeited at the end of the semester and upon the separation of the graduate assistant. \n3. The System Office of Human Resources shall publish a schedule showing the dates of each semester that sick leave will be advanced and forfeited in the Online Leave System and the number of hours of sick leave that will be advanced. A 9-month graduate assistant shall be advanced no more than 63 hours per year and a 11-month grad assistant shall be advanced no more than 77 hours per year, regardless of total FTE. Sick leave advances for graduate assistants with a 0.25 FTE appointment shall be prorated accordingly. \n4. Graduate assistants whose start of active employment is after the first day of each semester, including Summer, will have their sick leave advance prorated accordingly for the duration of the semester. \n5. When a graduate assistant renders less than a full semester of service, the sick leave advance shall be adjusted following the interruption of service and may result in the initiation of the salary and wage overpayment process. Graduate assistants’ sick leave allowance shall be reduced by a prorated amount: \n1. For the period of any sick leave granted when the employment terminates or is to terminate at the end of such leave; \n2. For any period of Leave Without Pay; \n3. For any period of unauthorized leave.\n6. A graduate assistant’s sick leave allowance shall remain unchanged for any period of paid wage loss replacement under workers' compensation.\n3. Notification of Illness 1. Through the OLS, notification of absence because of illness shall be given as soon as possible to the graduate assistant’s supervisor on or before the first day of absence, or if impracticable, as soon thereafter as circumstances permit. \n2. If the Supervisor does not acknowledge or approve the request, the graduate assistant shall notify the departmental Graduate Chair to appeal or approve the request for sick leave.\n4. Application for Sick Leave 1. A request for sick leave shall be submitted via the OLS within five (5) working days after return to duty for supervisor review and approval. \n2. The graduate assistant shall be required to submit a certificate from a licensed physician for absences of five (5) consecutive working days or more to substantiate the fact that the period of absence was due entirely to sickness and that the graduate assistant is now physically and mentally able to resume the duties of the position. The University may require the graduate assistant to be examined by a physician of the University's choice provided the University assumes the cost of the physician's services.\n5. Sick Leave Charged Only for Regular On-Duty Days 1. A regular on-duty day is synonymous with a regular State of Hawai‘i work day and does not include holidays and weekends. \n2. Graduate assistants shall submit a request for sick leave if they are absent from work due to sickness during any regular on-duty days, not to exceed twenty (20) hours per week. \n3. For graduate assistants on 9-month appointments, regular on-duty days occur during the period beginning with the first day of the semester in the fall and ending with the spring semester's commencement, including periods when classes are not scheduled.\n6. Sick leave may be allowed for medical, dental, optical, and optometric examination appointments that the graduate assistant cannot schedule during non-duty time.\n7. Bereavement Leave 1. Graduate assistants shall be allowed three (3) working days of bereavement leave which shall not be deducted from any other leave to which the graduate assistant receives. Bereavement leave shall be granted on days requested by the graduate assistant, provided they fall within a reasonable period of time after a death in the immediate family.\n2. If the death or funeral occurs outside the State of Hawai‘i, a graduate assistant may request a reasonable number of additional days of leave without pay (LWOP). Additional days of LWOP may affect the graduate assistant’s eligibility for tuition waiver. \n3. Graduate assistants shall claim all bereavement leave through the OLS.\nIV.

Purpose and Authority \n                            1. The purpose of this policy is to provide guidance on the hiring of APT employees, including the establishment and recruitment of positions and the determination of initial salaries. APT employees provide administrative, professional and technical support and services to the University and the community for research, academic, student and administrative purposes. The APT classification is unique to the University, as it groups positions into 4 bands, each of which covers a wide range of duties. The positions are broader in exchange for flexible initial hiring salaries and merit-based salary increases and performance bonuses.\n  \n                            2. The President has the authority to establish, amend or abolish APT bands and groups.\n  \n  \nII.  Definitions  Refer to [Definitions](https://www.hawaii.edu/ohr/documents/12171).   \n  \nIII.  Hiring an APT Employee  Supervisors shall obtain approval to hire an APT employee via the following process.\n                            1. Justify Need\n                               1. For a new position, supervisors should consider the services the unit provides and how the new position supports these services.\n  \n                               2. For vacant existing positions, supervisors shall evaluate (1) the impact of not filling a vacant position and (2) whether the position may support the unit in other ways. If the vacancy will have a negative impact on the unit’s operations or the position may be redescribed to satisfy an operational need, units should recruit to fill the position. Casual hires, overtime, temporary assignment and other temporary staffing options may be utilized, but should not be relied upon for extended periods of time. Units should actively recruit to fill the vacancy during the interim.\n                            2. [Establish/Update APT Position](https://www.hawaii.edu/ohr/apt/how-to-establish-update-apt-position/)Consult with HR Representative to develop the Position Description:\n                               1. Position Descriptions should be written broadly and flexibly to allow for in-band growth through career development. See EP 9.218.\n                               2. Position Descriptions should be updated when there are significant job changes, which may support a change in band. See EP 9.218.\n                            3. Determine Band and Group\n                               1. Review [band concepts](https://www.hawaii.edu/ohr/apt/apt-career-path/), [band guidelines](https://www.hawaii.edu/ohr/documents/12148), and [career groups](https://www.hawaii.edu/ohr/documents/2582) to determine appropriate band and job title.\n  \n                               2. Band C and D positions will undergo additional review. The Office of Human Resources (OHR), and the UH Hilo, UH West O‘ahu and Community College System HR Offices will consult with the committee of [subject matter experts](https://www.hawaii.edu/ohr/documents/12150), as appropriate.\n  \n                               3. Chancellors (UHH and UHWO), Provost and Vice Presidents shall have the authority to band and designate the Career Group for all APT positions within their organization. Community College Chancellors shall have the authority to band and designate the career group for positions in Bands A and B. See [EP 9.112](ep9.112), Delegation of Authority for Personnel Actions.\n  \n                               4. The effective date shall be the date the request is officially approved by the approving authority in the Position Description Generator. An [earlier effective date](https://www.hawaii.edu/ohr/documents/12152) may be authorized by the approving authority when deemed equitable.\n  \n                               5. An employee or supervisor may request an administrative review of the band action taken on the position by submitting the [administrative review form](https://www.hawaii.edu/ohr/documents/12154) to the respective approving authority.\n  \n                               6. In the event the employee or supervisor is not satisfied with the outcome of the administrative review, an [appeal](https://www.hawaii.edu/ohr/documents/12156) may be filed with the APT Classification Appeals Board.\n                            4. [Recruit for APT Employee](https://www.hawaii.edu/ohr/apt/recruitment/)\n                               1. Supervisors shall select the most qualified candidate that best fits the needs of the unit and in accordance with the Unit 8 Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA).\n  \n                               2. Units shall utilize the on-line recruitment system as a recruitment tool for all APT job announcements; comply with all EEO/AA requirements (see [RP 1.205](rp1.205) and [RP 4.201](http://www.hawaii.edu/policy/rp4.201)); appropriately develop interview questions; conduct thorough interviews; and complete reference checks prior to making a selection.\n                            5. Establish Initial Salary\n                               1. Refer to [Salary Placement for non-IT Professional](https://www.hawaii.edu/ohr/apt/apt-salary-placement/salary-placement-for-non-it-professional/) and [Salary Placement for IT Professional](https://www.hawaii.edu/ohr/apt/apt-salary-placement/salary-placement-for-it-professional/) to determine initial hiring salary for for APT Professional.\n  \n                               2. The University desires to attract and retain competent APT employees and be competitive with the appropriate market.\n  \n                               3. As a general rule, the initial salary should be at the minimum step of the assigned band unless a higher salary is justified and approved.\n  \n                               4. The initial salary and State of Hawai'i benefits package should be competitive with internal and reputable external salary benchmarks.\n  \n                               5. An initial salary for applicants shall fall between the minimum and maximum step of the assigned band, and shall take into consideration:  \n\n                                  1. Applicant’s relevant experience, education and training\n  \n                                  2. Applicant’s demonstrated ability to immediately apply required knowledge and skills to the job\n  \n                                  3.

Purpose Pursuant to Regents’ policy, RP 9.202, the President “shall have the authority to establish, amend, and administer a classification and compensation plan for graduate assistants.” The purpose of this executive policy is to describe the duties, qualification and eligibility criteria, compensation, and appointment terms for individuals who receive graduate assistantships.\nII. Definitions A Graduate Assistantship (GA) is a form of financial assistance provided to graduate students through part-time academic employment. Assistants are paid a stipend or a salary and receive tuition remission in exchange for work they perform for a faculty member, the department, or the college or school. The work is performed for either a 9-month or 11-month duty period, and the work schedule is generally up to 20 hours per week, or .50 full-time equivalence. All GAs are eligible for sick and bereavement leave as outlined in EP 9.240. Where eligible, a GA may receive additional benefits (e.g., additional pay for approved work above the 20 hours per week).\n\nThere are three types of graduate assistantships: (A) Graduate Assistantships, (B) Graduate Teaching Assistantships, and (C) Graduate Research Assistantships. Assistantship duties for each type may vary considerably both within and between programs. However all three types are limited to a workload to not exceed 20 hours per week, unless approved for an overload. The three general types of graduate assistantships are described below; however, for purposes of this policy, the assistantships regardless of type are generally referred to as graduate assistants.\n\n1. Graduate Assistant (GA)\nGraduate assistants (GAs) are graduate students who provide academic and program support to academic, administrative or service units of the university. Their appointment may be either 9 months or 11 months. GA responsibilities may be administrative in nature and consist of duties not directly related to teaching or research. This may include such duties as academic advising, program/event planning, advising student groups, and assisting with the administration of academic and student services offices.\n\n2. Graduate Teaching Assistants (GTA)\nTeaching assistants (GTAs) usually have a 9-month appointment that corresponds with the academic year. The specific duties of a GTA vary depending on the needs of the department and on the qualifications and experiences of the GTA. All GTAs serve under the supervision of a regularly appointed member of the faculty. They may teach a section(s) of a multi-section course or a laboratory section(s) of a course. In addition, they may assist a faculty member in grading assignments or exams, advising students, laboratory set-up, or performing course-related administrative duties. An experienced GTA may be assigned as the instructor of a course. In such a case, the GTA must meet all of the qualifications required to appropriately teach the course, or have completed a relevant training program. All new GTAs are required to attend a training session offered by the Office of Faculty Development and Academic Support - Center for Teaching Excellence.\n\nUniversity policy stipulates that in a course taught by a GTA, the determination of final grades is the responsibility of the supervising faculty. However, since the GTA plays a significant role in determining grades and may be the instructor of record, the supervising faculty and the GTA should thoroughly discuss course grading policies and procedures. The supervising faculty or Department Chair, should have access to all grades for courses taught by a GTA. To ensure fairness to all students enrolled in the course, grading policies and procedures should be announced at the beginning of the semester through a course syllabus. GTAs should be knowledgeable about official university policies on credits and grades, disciplinary actions, and academic grievance procedures. They should also be aware of the various student services available at their specific campus as well as the System Office of Student Affairs, so that they may refer students to the appropriate resources when necessary.\n\n3. Graduate Research Assistant (GRA)\nGraduate Research Assistants (GRAs) usually have an 11-month appointment. In general, a GRA supports the research activities of a faculty member who is the principal investigator of a funded project. The specific duties of a GRA vary depending on the needs of the project and on the qualifications and experiences of the GRA. The duties may be directly or tangentially related to the GRA’s program of study, and results from the research project may be incorporated into a thesis or dissertation as relevant. Some GRAs exercise a great degree of independence while performing their duties; others carry out specific tasks that leave little room for independent judgment. GRAs should be knowledgeable about official university policies on research and publication.\nIII. Executive Policy The President delegates authority to appoint Graduate Assistants to the respective Vice Presidents or Provost/Chancellors, as appropriate, with the ability to further delegate to Deans/Directors, as applicable, in accordance with the following:\n\n1. General duties and responsibilities\nUnder supervision of a faculty member or other designated supervisor, with some latitude for independent action as appropriate, to serve, for example, in one or more of the following capacities: teach a section of a multi-section course or a laboratory section of a course; teach a stand-alone course; assist a faculty member in grading assignments or exams, advising students, performing course-related administrative duties, preparing exhibits, serving as a demonstrations assistant in charge of tutorials, or reviewing material presented by the faculty member in charge of the course; supporting and assisting in the research activities of a faculty member who is the principal investigator of a funded project; or assisting in a range of administrative, planning, and organizational activities that may not entirely relate to teaching or research.\n\nSpecific duties and level of supervision depend on the needs of the project or department and on the qualifications and experience of the graduate assistant.\n\n2. Minimum qualifications and eligibility\n\n1. Graduation from an accredited college or university, and acceptance as a graduate student in an advanced degree program.\n\n2. Only graduate students enrolled in a graduate program for an advanced degree as approved by the University (excluding MD, JD and PharmD) are eligible for assistantships. Applicants must be enrolled in the discipline of the graduate assistantship or possess the minimum requirements of the assistantship assignment. Graduate students enrolled in graduate certificate programs are not eligible.\n\n3. An applicant must be in good academic standing upon admission (GPA of 3.0 or higher); have an undergraduate scholastic record with an adequate background in the field where the appointment is made; be in continued good academic standing for any renewal of the GA; and may not be on academic probation.\n\n4. Graduate Assistants must carry a minimum of 6 units of graduate level credit or equivalent toward the degree each semester and must maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or higher to be continued in the position. The maximum number of units of graduate level credits should not exceed 9 credits, unless approved by the respective graduate division. Note that one credit of thesis (specifically 700F) or dissertation (800) are equivalent to full time.\n\n5. International students must also demonstrate proficiency in English through sufficiently high scores in measures determined by each campus. If the language of instruction is Hawaiian, proficiency in the Hawaiian language as determined by the program and relevance to the duties is expected.\n\n6. Graduate Assistants must possess experience or other qualifications appropriate to the duties of the assistantship to which appointed and meet any further criteria stipulated by individual fields of study. Appointments are made on a competitive basis to the best qualified students.\n\nIn addition to grade point average and scores on special examinations, the motivation and goals of the student and familiarity and interest in the specialty areas of the faculty may be important factors in the awarding of assistantships.\n\n3. Tuition exemption\nUH Mānoa and UH Hilo graduate assistants, as a function of their appointment to an assistantship, are exempt from eligible tuition as it pertains to approved coursework for the regular fall/spring semester and, if applicable and approved, coursework for Outreach College credits for UH Mānoa. Graduate assistant appointments of .50 FTE, or 20 hours of work per week, are exempt from full-time graduate level tuition charges, excluding any student fees. Graduate assistant appointments of 0.25 FTE, or 10 hours of work per week, are exempt from one-half of the applicable tuition charges, excluding any student fees (see RP 6.207(C)).\n\n4. Pay schedule\n\n1. A pay schedule shall be developed by the Office of the Vice President for Academic Strategy. The schedule shall reflect steps for appointments, with a 17% differential between 9-month and 11-month based appointments. There shall be 4% differential between steps. The stipend or salary is paid over the duration of the appointment. Attachment A is the current schedule.\n\n2. The Provost/Chancellor of the University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa and University of Hawai‘i at Hilo may determine the minimum step for graduate assistants enrolled in programs at their campus. A campus appointing a graduate student enrolled in another campus must pay the minimum step or higher than the student’s academic home campus. Any UH Mānoa unit offering a GA below the minimum must receive prior approval from the Graduate Division. Where the student has external funding (e.g., Fulbright or other fellowships), the GA stipend or salary and the external funding combined can be no lower than the minimum step at which units are allowed to hire a GA.\n\n3. The pay schedule shall be reviewed on an annual basis by the Office of the Vice President for Academic Strategy to consider whether adjustments to the steps need to be made. Considerations will include cost of attendance.\n\n5. Recruitment and appointment\n\n1. The college may determine whether an advertisement is necessary. If the college cannot fill the appointment with eligible candidates, the vacant GA positions should be advertised.\n\n2. Selections must be made according to the Equal Employment Opportunity requirements. Placement in a teaching, research or other assistant appointment is made as appropriate to the requirements of the assigned duties.\n\n3. Appointments are generally for one academic year, with the possibility of renewal based on continued progression towards a graduate degree. The appointee must be in good academic standing. Appointments of shorter duration may be warranted if funding cannot be secured for two semesters or if the work required does not exceed two semesters. Appointments of duration of less than one academic year shall be conveyed at the time of selection and contained within the offer letter. In the case of extramurally funded positions, an appointment of more than one year may be offered if funding is available.\n\n4. Initial placement on the pay schedule will reflect the graduate student’s experience, ability, discipline, and assigned responsibility, but may not be lower than the minimum level designated for the student’s home campus except for students approved to be hired at the lower rate as described in D2.\n\n5. Notification of appointment to the selectee shall be provided as quickly as possible, followed by an offer letter. See Attachment B for an offer letter template.\n\n6. Reappointments\n\n1. Appointments may be renewed annually, based upon satisfactory performance both as a student and as a graduate assistant, and contingent upon available funds. The designated supervisor (e.g., department chair or principal investigator) is responsible for initiating discussion with the graduate assistant and notifying the respective human resources office.\n\n2. Advancement to the next step, after at least one year of satisfactory service, may be considered, subject to fund availability, and recommended by the supervisor (e.g., department chair, principal investigator, staff, etc.), with the approval of the pertinent academic dean or institute director.\n\n3. Reappointments must meet criteria established for new appointees.\n\n4. Notification of reappointments via a letter of reappointment shall be made to the graduate assistants in a timely manner by April 15 for fall reappointments and November 1 for spring reappointments. If notification of reappointment cannot be given by these deadlines, the graduate assistant cannot be obligated to commit to possible future assistantships.\n\n5. While individual circumstances may vary, the total time as a graduate assistant should be limited to three years for a master's degree student and to six years for a doctoral or other terminal degree student.\n\n7. Step advancement. As stated under section F.2., advancement to the next step, after one year of satisfactory service, shall be considered, subject to fund availability. In addition, for doctoral students, upon completion of a graduate master’s degree, the graduate assistant shall submit a copy of the degree documentation and have the opportunity to meet with the supervisor to discuss a justified step movement. All proposed step advancement shall be recommended by the designated supervisor (e.g., department chair, principal investigator, staff, etc.) with the approval of the pertinent academic dean or institute director. The frequency of the step movement is subject to fund availability and individual program guidelines which accounts for internal salary alignment.\n\n8. Outside employment. The University’s priority for a graduate assistant is degree completion. While outside employment in addition to the graduate assistantship is not prohibited, such outside employment is discouraged to allow the graduate student to focus on degree completion. However, the University recognizes the need for graduate assistants to fulfill personal financial obligations. The graduate student shall consider the impact of such outside employment on degree completion and the fulfillment and performance of the graduate assistant duties and responsibilities, and address any conflicts of interest. Where applicable, graduate assistants may be required to complete an outside employment form as detailed in RP 9.207.\n\n9. Schedule accommodation and duties coverage. Graduate assistants do not earn vacation leave. EP 9.240, graduate assistants are eligible for sick and bereavement leave. Through the Online Leave System (OLS), notification of absence because of illness shall be given as soon as possible to the graduate assistant’s supervisor on or before the first day of absence, or if impracticable, as soon thereafter as circumstances permit. Sick leave may be allowed for medical, dental, optical, and optometric appointments that the graduate assistant cannot schedule during non-duty time.\n\nGraduate assistants shall be allowed three (3) working days of bereavement leave which shall not be deducted from any other leave that the graduate assistant receives. Bereavement leave shall be granted on days requested by the graduate assistant, provided they fall within a reasonable period of time after a death in the immediate family. If the death or funeral occurs outside the State of Hawai‘i, a graduate assistant may request a reasonable number of additional days of leave without pay (LWOP). Additional days of LWOP may affect the graduate assistant’s eligibility for a tuition waiver. Graduate assistants shall claim all bereavement leave through the OLS.\n\nIn situations where a graduate assistant is unable to attend work due to illness, emergency or bereavement, the designated supervisor (e.g., department chair, principal investigator, staff, etc.) shall identify a primary and a secondary department member who will serve as the point of contact and provide accommodations in the graduate assistant work schedule. In the case where there are critical teaching or research deadlines, to the extent it is possible under the circumstances, the graduate assistant shall work with the designated supervisor to identify resources to provide the critical teaching or research coverage.\n\n10. Termination of Assistantship. An assistantship may be terminated if the student fails to maintain good academic standing, if performance is unsatisfactory, for misconduct, or for lack of funding. The graduate assistant shall be given reasonable notice.\n\n11. Resignation. A graduate assistant may terminate the assistantship with reasonable notice.\n\n12. Grievances. An employment-related grievance shall be filed in accordance with the GA Complaint Procedure.\n\n13. Other. Graduate assistants who meet the eligibility requirements of the Family and Medical Leave Act or Hawai‘i State Family Leave, may request leave pursuant to University procedure.\nIV.

Executive Policy The University can best achieve its mission by creating a supportive working environment in which individuals encourage one another to pursue excellence in their professional and personal lives. Students, faculty and staff share a responsibility to help one another by learning to recognize the signs and behaviors associated with substance abuse and addiction, and by encouraging those with such problems to seek appropriate help and rehabilitation. Once an individual has undergone treatment for substance abuse or addiction, the University should extend support and encouragement during the recovery phase.\nThe University expects lawful behavior by students, faculty and staff during their presence on University premises and at University events. Within the constraints of its mission, the University encourages cooperation with law enforcement agencies in enforcing statutes regarding the use of illegal drugs.\nSubstance abuse interferes with the physiological and abstract processes through which mental activity occurs and with social behaviors required for research and learning. Consequently, the University expects that students, faculty and staff will carry out their responsibilities free of any substance abuse.\nA. University Expectations Regarding Substance and Alcohol Abuse and Illegal Drugs\n1. Students, faculty and staff are expected to perform their duties free of intoxication by any illegal drugs or alcohol.\n2. Students, faculty and staff are expected to observe laws regulating illegal drugs and may be subject to investigation and/or prosecution for illegal drug use.\n3. Faculty, staff, and students are not permitted to manufacture, distribute, possess, use, dispense or be under the influence of illegal drugs as prohibited by state and federal law, at University-sponsored or approved events or on University property or in buildings used by the University for education, research and recreational programs.\n4. Students, faculty and staff are expected to share responsibility for the well-being of each other, for recognizing the behaviors associated with substance abuse, and for encouraging those in need to seek assistance or treatment.\n5. The University community should expect support services and supportive attitudes by its members for students, faculty and staff reentering the community after treatment for or during recovery from substance abuse.\n6. The University expects its students, faculty and staff to share responsibility for preventing substance abuse and addiction and for providing education about the subject through studies, research and special programming.\n7. The University should expect to assume a leadership role in the acquisition and transmission of knowledge related to substance abuse and addiction, and to collaborate with the broader community in activities related to prevention of drug abuse including training of professional workers in this area.\n8. The University recognizes that substance abuse is a complex problem that is not easily resolved solely by personal effort and may require professional assistance and/or treatment. Students, faculty and staff members with substance abuse problems are encouraged to take advantage of available diagnostic, referral, counseling and prevention services. The University will not excuse misconduct by employees and students whose judgment is impaired due to substance abuse.\nB. Applicability\nThis policy applies to all members of the university community including students, faculty, and staff.\nC.

Purpose To establish Systemwide controls for University-owned indicia, and to permit manufacturers and related commercial entities the use of such indicia on or in products.\nII. Definitions A. Indicia: As used in this policy, “indicia” includes without limitation, the following: the name, seal, logos, symbols, initials, designs, logographics, other abbreviations or verbiage developed by or associated with the University, or any college, school, department, or activity, within the University System, and which may be applied to items manufactured for sale to the public.\nIII. Executive Policy A. INTRODUCTION\n\nUnder Section 304A-103(3), Hawai?i Revised Statutes, 2006, as amended, the University of Hawai?i by its Board of Regents has the power to enter into contracts on terms it deems appropriate and to manage its property. The President has been delegated the authority to approve, sign and execute contracts, as provided by Board of Regents Policy, Section 8-1a. The following objectives, policies and guidelines provide for the systematic control and use of the University-owned indicia, to enable the University to benefit from revenues generated through the use of the indicia such as logos, seals, symbols, marks, verbiage and other trademarks identified with the University of Hawai?i.\n\nThis policy establishes the University’s collegiate licensing program in accordance with Section 1-6 of the Board of Regents Policies. \n\nB. ADMINISTRATION OF LICENSING POLICY\n\n1. Licensing Administrator: An individual who: (1) coordinates and oversees the daily operation of the licensing program and (2) develops and implements administrative policies and objectives pertaining to the protection and proper use of the University indicia. \n\n a. The Licensing Administrator shall have the authority to: \n\n (1) propose practices and procedures to implement this policy; \n\n (2) register the indicia with the appropriate Federal and/or State agencies; \n\n (3) propose royalty rates and/or administrative fees to be charged to licensees; \n\n (4) initiate documentation to grant licenses or otherwise authorize third parties to use the indicia; \n\n (5) work with the University’s contracting officer to contract with agents to assist in the administration of this program on a local, national, and international level; and \n\n (6) review the use of the indicia on products, in promotions, and in other commercial uses that may arise from time to time. \n\n2. Licensing Committee: The Vice President for Administration may appoint a Licensing Committee to work with the Licensing Administrator to establish practices and procedures to implement this policy. The Vice President for Administration shall appoint a member of the Committee to serve as its chair. The Committee shall function in an advisory capacity to the Vice President for Administration. \n\n3. Categories, Indicia: Indicia fall into two basic categories as follows: \n\n a. Those works in which the University owns the copyright, and qualify for the relatively simple registration process under the federal Copyright Law, as amended (17 U.S.C. 101, et, seq.). These works generally include creative pictorial and graphic works, e.g. two-dimensional works of fine, graphic, and applied art, photographs, prints, maps, diagrams, etc.; and \n\n b. Those de minimis works in which creative authorship is slight such as names, titles, slogans, letterings, colorings, etc., which would not qualify for copyright. These Indicia are more properly subject to State of Hawai?i Trademark Registration (Chapter 482, H.R.S., as amended) if the use is limited to intrastate; and concurrent State registration, as well as federal registration under the Federal Trademark Act of 1946, as amended (15 U.S.C. 1051-1127) if the use is in both intrastate and interstate commerce. \n\n4. License/Minimum Standards: Standard non-exclusive licenses shall be controlled, numbered, and issued to each licensee by the University’s contracting officer or his/her designee. The minimum standards to be met by each licensee are as follows: \n\n a. At the time of license execution, each licensee shall be required to pay the University the advance guaranteed annual royalty and administrative fees as specified under this policy; \n\n b. Each licensee shall be issued a non-exclusive license for an initial term of not longer than one (1) year subject to revocation for cause; \n\n c. Each licensee shall pay a reasonable annual royalty that adequately reflects the value added to the product on which the indicia are displayed. In developing the royalty rate, consideration may be given to the cost to the consumer, the impact on the licensees and retail community, and the rates in place at institutions of similar size and stature to the University; \n\n d. Each licensee shall observe established University rules and policies; \n\n e. Each licensee shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the University and the State of Hawai?i, and their officers, employees, agents, and representatives, and any person acting for or on their behalf, from and against any and all claims, demands, suits, actions, causes of action, judgments, injunctions, orders, rulings, directives, penalties, assessments, liabilities, losses, damages, costs, and expenses (including, without limitation, attorney’s fees and litigation related costs), arising from any claimed injury to or death of persons, personal injury, or damage to or destruction of property, resulting from or related to any act or omission of the licensee, or any of the licensee’s officers, employees, agents, representatives, subcontractors, sublicensees, vendors, suppliers, customers, invitees, or any person acting for or on behalf of the licensee, including, without limitation, any claims or actions for libel, slander, defamation, invasion of privacy, unfair competition, misappropriation, trademark or copyright infringement, or other related or similar claim arising from any broadcasts, promotional announcements, advertisements, articles, programs or other materials disseminated, or activities undertaken by the licensee; \n\n f. Each licensee shall provide evidence of appropriate and adequate insurance protection covering the licensee’s indemnification obligations and any claims for product liability, property damage, personal injury, bodily injury, and death arising out of or in connection with the use of indicia, which policy must be renewed upon expiration for the life of the license and proof thereof submitted to the University; and \n\n g. The Vice President for Administration may waive any or all requirements of Section IV.E above, upon written request and after determining that it is in the best interest of the University. \n\n5. General Licensing Guidelines (Strict compliance with these Guidelines is essential to protect the University in the event of I.R.S. inquiry with regard to the generation of unrelated trade or business taxable income I.R.S. 512 (b) (2), and 513 (a) (2). The Vice President of Administration may develop guidelines for licensing the use of the University indicia. \n\n6. Internal Processing and Controls: \n\n a. The Licensing Administrator is designated as the control point, and the individual authorized to receive all inquiries and requests to use University indicia that may be made or submitted to any part of the University system, including all four year and community college campuses; \n\n b. The Licensing Administrator shall review such proposals and work with the legal, risk management, procurement or other contracting designee, and external affairs/university relations offices, as needed, to negotiate, draft and issue a standard non-exclusive license agreement as defined in Section IV.E; \n\n c. The Licensing Administrator shall work with the University’s contracting officer or the contracting officer’s designee to obtain the licensee’s signature, finalize the issuance of the license agreement, collect the advance royalties and other applicable fees and provide contract administration services relating to the issued license agreement; and \n\n d. All license royalty revenue realized shall be placed in an account established in the University of Hawai?i commercial enterprises revolving fund (HRS§304A-2251) under the control of the Vice President for Administration or the Vice President’s designee. Distributions from this account may be made in accordance with §304A-2251. \nIV. Delegation of Authority The Vice President for Administration or the Vice President who organizationally oversees the Collegiate Licensing Office is authorized to administer this policy throughout the University system.\nV.

An employee whose appointment is for six (6) months or more shall, while on active duty or during periods of camps of instruction or field maneuvers as a member of the Hawai‘i national guard, air national guard, naval militia, organized reserves, including the officers’ reserve corps, the enlisted reserve corps or the public health service commission corps, under call of the President of the United States or the Governor of the State, be placed on leave with pay status for a period not exceeding fifteen (15) working days in any calendar year, except as provided in subparagraph A.2.\n2. If an employee is called to active duty or is required to report for camp training or field maneuvers by official military orders a second time within a calendar year, the employee may elect to use up to fifteen (15) working days of the succeeding calendar year; provided that the employee’s entitlement to the working days advanced shall be canceled from the succeeding calendar year, and the employee shall so agree in writing. The employee who is advanced leave shall be required to reimburse the University an amount equivalent to the days advanced in the event the employee leaves government employment prior to the completion of a year’s service in the succeeding year from which leave was advanced, except in the case of death of the employee. \nB. Military Leave Without Pay\n1. When requested, permanent and probationary employees who are eligible for reemployment rights pursuant to USERRA and whose appointments are expected to continue indefinitely or for a significant period of time are entitled to military leave without pay when called to perform active military service. Employees with brief, non-recurrent appointments or appointments which are unlikely to continue indefinitely or for a significant period of time (generally one year or less in duration), such as 89-day hires, casual hires, etc. and graduate assistants, are not eligible. \n2. The duration of the military leave without pay shall be for not more than five (5) years; provided the leave does not exceed the ending date of the employee’s appointment period, and subject to the exceptions provided by the USERRA. \n3. Upon conclusion of the military leave without pay, eligible employees shall be entitled to reemployment rights in accordance with the USERRA.\nC. The employee shall be responsible for providing advance written or verbal notice to their supervisor for all military duty unless giving notice is impossible, unreasonable, or precluded by military necessity. The employee should provide notice as far in advance as is reasonable under the circumstances. All employees must furnish the employer with a copy of their official military orders, once available, to receive military leave with or without pay.\nD. An employee who engages in the performance of ordered military duty shall maintain the rights and benefits identified in Chapter 78-16.6, Hawai‘i Revised Statutes (e.g. vacation leave, holiday privileges) and shall not be prejudiced in matters involving promotion or continuance in office, employment, reappointment or reemployment."

Purpose  To implement Regents Policy (RP) 11.203 regarding the naming of facilities, properties, and programs subject to the approval of the Board or the President, as delegated in RP 11.203.  \n  \nTo establish a mechanism for the review of proposals for the thematic, functional, route, honorific or philanthropic naming of facilities, properties, programs and interior spaces.  \n  \nTo establish that the designation of descriptive or functional titles is delegated to the campus Chief Executive Officers (CEOs).    \nII. Definitions  “Philanthropic naming” is an act that purposefully designates a name or title for a facility, property, or program in order to honor or recognize a significant donor to the university whether a person, family, or other entity.   \n  \n“Honorific naming” is an act that purposefully designates a name or title for a facility, property, or program in order to honor, memorialize, or recognize a person or entity, of significance to the University.   \n  \n“Interior spaces” means classrooms, laboratories, offices, conference rooms, cafeterias, lounges, work spaces, locker rooms, competitive spaces, or external space directly associated with a specific facility such as a lanai, courtyard, or connecting walkways between facilities.   \n  \n“Program” means any academic, instructional, research, administrative, or public service program or enterprise operated or supported by the University intended to educate students, enhance the academic body of knowledge, support the overall health or well-being of students, faculty, or staff, or advance the State of Hawai‘i. This includes schools, colleges, divisions, departments, institutes, centers and other such designations.  Programs are further categorized as degree-granting or non-degree-granting depending on whether or not the program is responsible for the award of credit degrees and/or certificates.  \n  \n“Outdoor plant, tree, or space” means a plant, tree, or outdoor space not directly associated with a specific external facility space as defined by \"Internal spaces\", e.g., a bench or benches.    \nIII. Executive Policy  This Executive policy directs implementation of Board of Regents Policy, RP 11.203, Naming of University Facilities, Properties and Programs.  \n  \n1.

In accordance with their campus procedures, campus CEOs may recommend to the President names for University facilities, properties, and programs in keeping with the following guidelines.  No commitment for naming shall be made prior to approval of the proposed name.  \n3. The authority to designate descriptive or functional titles is delegated to the campus CEOs.  University facilities, properties, and programs not named honorifically or philanthropically are customarily designated based on function, occupancy, a coordinated system (e.g., plant names, Hawaiian words), or numbers/letters.\n4. The authority to designate naming for Lectureships, Faculty Research Funds, Post-Doctoral Fellowships, Graduate Fellowships, Undergraduate Scholarships, and Library or Archival Funds is delegated to the campus CEOs, provided that the UH Foundation shall participate in recommendations for philanthropic recognition.\n5. A matrix summarizing the necessary level of approval for honorific or philanthropic namings is provided below.  In addition, the UH Foundation shall be consulted on all philanthropic namings in accordance with Executive Policy 8.209 (Fund Raising).  \nIV. Delegation of Authority  There is no additional delegation of authority beyond that outlined in this policy.    \nV.

Purpose  To establish a definition, taxonomy, and broad guidelines for the development and issuance of micro-credentials.  \n  \nTo identify campus responsibilities in the creation of policies and practices designed to ensure academic standards and consistent practice in development and issuance of micro-credentials    \nII. Definitions  Definitions of all degrees and certificates offered by the University of Hawai‘i System are provided in EP 5.205.  \n  \n\n                            1. General Definitions:  \n\n                               1. Credential:  A credential is a general term that can be used to describe a degree, certificate, or other form of institutional-based acknowledgment.\n  \n\n                               2. Micro-Credential: A micro-credential is a small unit of study that provides specific competencies that contribute to the needs of communities, industries, and students. Micro-credentials have stand-alone value and may satisfy components of other micro-credentials or credentials (certificates, minors, or degrees) through assessment or recognition of prior learning. Micro-credentials may be issued for credit, non-credit, or other recognized and assessed prior learning achievements. Those that bear credit are of a lesser scale than degrees, majors, minors, certificates, and concentrations. All micro-credentials include an assessment based on clearly defined standards and measurable learning outcomes. Micro-credentials awarded by the University of Hawai‘i meet the standards required by the issuing UH campus.\n  \n\n                               3. UH Recognized Micro-Credential: UH recognized micro-credentials are those eligible for digital badging through the UH System and are managed within a coordinated framework. Recognized micro-credentials are validated learning achievements that support workforce development goals.\n  \n\n                               4. Digital Badge: A digital badge is the digital representation of an achievement, including but not limited to an earned micro-credential. The relationship of a digital badge to a micro-credential is similar to the relationship of a diploma to an earned degree. Digital badges are verifiable through embedded meta-data and meet Open Badges standards, which ensures portability and legibility across various platforms that adhere to these standards.\n  \n\n                            2. Hierarchy of Micro-Credentials  \n  \nAs micro-credentials are intended to recognize various levels of learner skills, the following hierarchy has been established:  \n\n                               1. Awareness - Requires the learner to demonstrate foundational knowledge related to a skill set.\n  \n\n                               2. Proficiency - Requires application and analysis of the target skill set.\n  \n\n                               3. Mastery – Requires a demonstrated ability to evaluate or create based on accomplished level of ability.\n  \n  \n\n                            3. Categories of Digital Badges  \n  \n\n                               1. Participation - Not a micro-credential but can be badged.\n  \n\n                               2. Skill - Badge issued for non-credit workforce training or professional development micro-credentials issued by UH.\n  \n\n                               3. Association - Badge issued for achievement of a micro-credential related to a third-party learning experience (e.g., Prior Learning Assessment, industry-issued badge or micro-credential).\n  \n\n                               4. Academic Achievement – Badge issued for a credit-bearing micro-credential.\n  \nIII. Executive Policy \n                            1. The authority to approve new instructional programs is detailed in RP 5.201, Instructional Programs, and EP 5.201, Approval of New Academic Programs and Review of Provisional Academic Programs, while the authority to award degrees and certificates is governed by EP 5.101, Authority to Award Degrees and Certificates for Programs Authorized by the Board of Regents. As micro-credentials are skill-based and may be awarded irrespective of course completion or the earning of credits, they are not classified as instructional programs under UH policy.\n  \n\n                            2. Micro-credentials shall be developed by faculty, according to procedures established by each campus. It is the purview and responsibility of each campus to develop and implement procedures for the creation of new micro-credentials. Each campus shall be responsible for ensuring the integrity and effectiveness of its micro-credential offerings through appropriate processes of assessment and evaluation.\n  \n\n                            3. Chancellors/Provost have the authority to approve the creation of micro-credentials and the issuance of digital badges and may delegate this authority to the chief academic officer or other designee at their campus, who is responsible for adhering to accreditation requirements.\n  \n\n                            4. The Office of the Vice President for Information Technology, in collaboration with the Office of the Vice President for Academic Strategy, provides system-level coordination of recognized micro-credentials offered across the UH campuses. Recognized micro-credentials are vetted to determine alignment with workforce development strategic initiatives, facilitate stackability of micro-credentials offered throughout the UH system, and coordinate systemwide data management. Recognized micro-credentials are eligible for digital badging, designed and issued through the UH System enterprise-level digital badging process.\n  \n\n                            5. Micro-credentials may be embedded in existing courses within the curriculum. Micro-credentials issued for credit may be constructed in such a manner that will allow students to be eligible for federal financial aid. Academic departments may include micro-credentials as part of a degree program, allowing for the micro-credential to count within students' Course Program of Study (CPOS), thereby facilitating transfer between UH institutions. In such cases, campuses shall follow the terms of [EP 6.204, Student Financial Assistance Program](https://www.hawaii.edu/policy/?action=viewPolicy&policySection=ep&policyChapter=6&policyNumber=204).\n  \n\n                            6. It is expected that micro-credentials, as defined and covered under this policy, will not require significant resources. Any prospective micro-credentials requiring significant resources require approval of the Board of Regents, as specified in [RP 5.201](https://hawaii.edu/policy/docs/temp/rp5.201.pdf).\n  \n\n                            7. As micro-credentials are linked to competencies and need not consist of sets of credit-bearing courses, they may provide campuses with opportunities to reach previously untapped markets of students. While each campus retains the purview to establish its own admissions policies and practices for micro-credentials, each campus must abide by the terms of [RP 5.211, Admissions](https://www.hawaii.edu/policy/index.php?action=viewPolicy&policySection=rp&policyChapter=5&policyNumber=211&menuView=closed), which establishes parameters for the admission of students into academic programs.\n  \n\n                            8. Micro-credentials may be stackable, which means that they can be accumulated over time in a structured sequence or pathway leading to a higher-order credential. Each campus shall determine criteria and processes for the incremental stacking of micro-credentials, including how they might lead to a credential.\n  \n\n                            9. Each campus shall be responsible for recording student enrollment and achievement data for its micro-credential offerings in a central repository, as well as reporting out on those data points, as required by institutional accrediting bodies and/or UH leadership. Each campus shall be responsible for adhering to the U.S. Department of Education Financial Value Transparency and Gainful Employment Rule reporting requirements, as applicable.\n  \nIV.

Establish clear lines of accountability and decision rights through the definition of roles and responsibilities related to data management;\n  \n5. Establish a set of standardized terms and definitions to promote consistent interpretations and implementations of policies, procedures, and practices related to data management.\n  \nII. Definitions \n1. “Data Sharing Request Process” – A process that governs the release of Institutional Data and provides an understanding of how the data is being used, by whom, and where it is being copied and stored.\n  \n2. “Data Users” – All UH employees, students, and affiliates who, in order to fulfill their job duties and responsibilities, require access to UH Institutional Data.\n  \n3. “Departmental/Unit/Local Data Repositories” – Various UH academic and administrative departments or units copy Institutional Data from Institutional Data Systems into their own departmental, unit, or local data repositories. Any Departmental/Unit/Local Data Repository that contains a copy of Institutional Data are subject to the same policies and procedures which govern the use of Institutional Data.  This policy applies to all repositories of Institutional Data, irrespective of where the repository is maintained (for example, a department may contract for cloud storage services to maintain its data repository).  \n\n“Departmental/Unit/Local Data Repositories” – Various UH academic and administrative departments or units copy Institutional Data from Institutional Data Systems into their own departmental, unit, or local data repositories. Any Departmental/Unit/Local Data Repository that contains a copy of Institutional Data are subject to the same policies and procedures which govern the use of Institutional Data.  This policy applies to all repositories of Institutional Data, irrespective of where the repository is maintained (for example, a department may contract for cloud storage services to maintain its data repository).\n  \n4. “Institutional Data” – Data elements which are created, received, maintained and/or transmitted by the University of Hawai‘i in the course of meeting its administrative and academic requirements.  \nInstitutional Data may be  \n  \n1. contained in any form, including but not limited to documents, databases, spreadsheets, email, and websites;\n  \n2. represented in any form, including but not limited to letters, numbers, words, pictures, videos, sounds, symbols, or any combination thereof;\n  \n3. communicated in any form, including but not limited to handwriting, printing, photocopying, photographing, and web publishing; and\n  \n4. recorded upon any form, including but not limited to papers, maps, films, prints, discs, drives, memory sticks, and other information systems.\n  \n5. “Institutional Data Systems” – UH systemwide data repositories that collect and store both transactional (operational) and reporting types of Institutional Data, including Systems of Record. In some cases, Institutional Data may be purged on a regular basis from an Institutional Data System. Institutional Data Systems are subject to the same policies and procedures that govern the use of Institutional Data. Examples of Institutional Data Systems are the Banner Student Information System, PeopleSoft, Kuali Financial System, STAR, Laulima, etc.  \n\nA list of Institutional Data Systems and associated System Executive Data Stewards is available on the UH data governance website. Note the list is not intended to be all-inclusive of the University’s Institutional Data Systems, but rather, represents Institutional Data Systems that are most likely to contain Protected Data.\n  \n6. “Protected Data” – Institutional Data that are subject to security and privacy considerations that range from moderate to very high (i.e., all non-public data). These data fall under the Institutional Data Classification Categories of “restricted,” “sensitive,” and “regulated.” For more information, refer to Executive Policy [EP 2.214, Institutional Data Classification Categories and Information Security Guidelines](http://hawaii.edu/policy/ep2.214).\n  \n7. “System of Record” – Institutional Data that are designated by a Data Steward as representing official values of the University. Official values are the data designated as the most accurate representation of the meaning and context of Institutional Data elements, which are recorded as facts. Official values are not necessarily the originally entered values, and as such, a System of Record may not necessarily be the system where values are originally entered. When questions arise over the meaning or interpretation of data elements or their values, the System of Record is used to resolve discrepancies.\n  \nIII. Executive Policy \n1. POLICY STATEMENTThe University holds itself accountable for the privacy and security of its Institutional Data and other data under its stewardship while keeping that data accessible for appropriate use. The data governance program strives to achieve this by fostering a culture of shared responsibility and active participation among members of the University community.  \n\n2. GOALSThe goals of data governance at the University are to:  \n  \n1. Protect the privacy and security of data and information under the stewardship of the University;\n  \n2. Support a culture of responsible data use for informed and actionable decision making;\n  \n3. Establish systemwide standards that enable holistic understanding of data across institutional boundaries;\n  \n4. Promote the efficient use of resources to meet the data and information needs of the University community;\n  \n5. Increase the University’s transparency and accountability to external stakeholders and the public by promoting access to relevant information.\n3. SCOPEThe scope of this institutional data governance policy applies to the following:  \n  \n1. Individuals employed by the University or any affiliates (including external agencies such as RCUH, Sodexo, third party vendors, etc.) with access to University-related data and information (i.e., Institutional Data);\n  \n2. All Institutional Data created, collected, analyzed, and reported on by UH units as part of their administrative and academic functions, regardless of where they are located and in what medium they are stored (e.g., physical or electronic), how they are accessed, and how they are transmitted;\n  \n3. Institutional Data, such as student demographics, used in surveys or studies  \n  \n4. Protected Data that has been created, collected, or analyzed for the purpose of research.\n  \nThis policy recognizes the legal responsibilities of individual campuses to protect the privacy and security of their students’ data according to FERPA requirements.\n4. PRINCIPLESThe following principles are set forth as minimum standards to govern the appropriate use and management of Institutional Data.  \n  \n1. Institutional Data is the property of the University of Hawai‘i and shall be managed as a key asset through defined governance standards, policies, and procedures.\n  \n2. Institutional Data will be safeguarded and protected according to security, privacy, and compliance rules and regulations established by the federal and state government (see section I-B), and University of Hawai‘i policies. This University of Hawai‘i executive policy is not intended to supercede federal and state rules and regulations, but to promote and reinforce them.\n  \n3. Access to Institutional Data will be based on defined roles. Users deemed to have a legitimate educational interest will be assigned appropriate access based on their roles.\n  \n4. Institutional representatives will be held accountable to their roles and responsibilities. Roles and responsibilities involving the management and use of Institutional Data will be clearly defined, and individuals assigned to specific roles will be held accountable for their data management responsibilities.\n  \n5. The use, storage, and exposure of protected data will be minimized whenever possible.\n  \n6. The University strives to ensure the safety and security of its employees and its data assets. It will employ strategies in multiple ways, including the use of technology, physical space, etc. The strategies will take into consideration the privacy of individuals and the protection of data based on the level of sensitivity.\n  \n7. The University’s technical resources will be used for institutional purposes only and not for personal and/or private gain or for malicious intent.\n5. BEST PRACTICES\n1. Minimal access will be granted to Data Users. Individuals, including non-UH personnel (e.g., third party contractors), will be granted the most restrictive set of permissions and privileges based on feasibility and a need-to-know. Not only will the minimal level of access to perform an operation be granted, that access will be granted only for the duration of time necessary to complete the operation.\n  \n2. Disclosure of Institutional Data that are considered protected and personally identifiable will be based on a need to know. When possible, Institutional Data being disclosed will be de-identified.\n  \n3. Quality standards for Institutional Data will be defined, implemented, monitored, and communicated by System Executive Data Stewards of Institutional Data Systems (defined in sections II, Definitions and III-F, Roles and Responsibilities). Examples of data quality standards include: data validation rules, timeliness of updates, defined error rates, etc.\n  \n4. Unnecessary duplication of Institutional Data is discouraged. Maintaining repositories of redundant data increases the risk of inadvertent disclosure or inappropriate access to Institutional Data. Executive Data Stewards and Data Custodians (defined in section III-F, Roles and Responsibilities) will exercise responsible records management practices, including minimizing redundant storage where reasonable and appropriate.\n  \n5. Data Users will complete mandatory training requirements on the appropriate handling of Protected Data before they are allowed access. For more information, refer to [AP 2.215, Mandatory Training and Continuing Education Requirements for Data Users](http://hawaii.edu/policy/ap2.215).\n  \n6. Resolution of issues related to Institutional Data will follow consistent and public processes. The Data Governance Committee (DGC) will coordinate the resolution of issues related to risks, costs, access, management, and use of Institutional Data with the appropriate Data Stewards and with UH leadership.\n  \n7. Institutional Data will only be released for student surveys that are being administered for institutional purposes (such as improving services for students) and/or for the benefit students. Campuses make the final decision on which surveys student contact information will be released.  \n\nAs part of the Data Sharing Request Process, requests involving the release of Institutional Data for student surveys will require an affirmative response from each Campus Executive Data Steward.\n  \n8. Institutional Data that was requested through the Data Sharing Request Process for a specific purpose cannot be used for another purpose.\n  \n9. UH data agreements involving software and/or services and the collection, management, sharing, exchange, use and/or release of Protected Data must meet the principles and best practices set forth in this policy, along with provisions in [EP 8.200, Policy on Contracts and Signing Authority](http://hawaii.edu/policy/ep8.200). Such agreements include, but are not limited to, vendor contracts, subscriptions, and memoranda of agreements/understanding. Appendix 9 of EP 8.200 features a template “Data Sharing Protections and Requirements” that can be incorporated into data agreements, as needed.\n  \n10. Guidelines and procedures for the effective management of Institutional Data throughout its lifecycle (from creation to destruction) will be established. Guidelines and procedures involving the creation or acquisition, storage and maintenance, use, archival, and destruction of Institutional Data will be available to direct Data Users and Data Custodians in their data management practices.\n  \n11. Activities that reduce the potential exposure of sensitive information will be implemented through an information security program. The University will establish an information security program that addresses the following areas, including, but not limited to, governance structures, security audits, risk assessments, identity management, access controls, education and training, and network monitoring. The program will perform ongoing audits of high risk areas and enforce remediation measures, as necessary.\n  \n12. Contingency plans for managing security breaches and disaster recovery will be established. The process for managing security breaches and other inappropriate uses of Institutional Data will be addressed in University policy. Types of information included will be a definition of a security breach, guidelines on the timing, contents, and means of notice to affected parties, etc. Disaster recovery plans will include contingencies for the physical security of affected sites containing Protected Data.\n  \n13. Accessing Institutional Data remotely (for example, off-campus) will be done in a secure manner. Individuals who will be electronically accessing Institutional Data from a location other than their usual work areas will ensure they are not using unprotected or public wireless connections.\n6. ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIESThe following roles and responsibilities are defined, for both individuals and groups, for the purpose of establishing clear governance and accountabilities over Institutional Data. The terms and conditions for appointments and assignments are outlined for each. Note that for University employees whose duties and responsibilities fall within a controlled access environment, this policy should not impact their daily activities, but rather, should clarify and formalize their roles and responsibilities.  \n  \n1. Vice President for Academic Planning and Policy (VPAPP) – The lead institutional officer responsible for developing and implementing the University’s data governance program. Authority and responsibility resides with the VPAPP on policy and system (multi-campus) issues. The VPAPP is the University’s authority to approve data commitments involving student success initiatives with other educational institutions or national education related non-profit organizations that require the collection, management, sharing, exchange, use and/or release of Protected Data.\n  \n2. Vice President for Information Technology and Chief Information Officer (VPIT/CIO) – The officer responsible for setting and enforcing standards and guidelines for data management technologies and systems related to computing infrastructures, data processing performance, data delivery and integration, data architectures and structures, metadata repositories, and access control mechanisms. The VPIT/CIO has custodial authority over centralized Institutional Data Systems, including the student, financial, and human resources databases. The VPIT/CIO is the University’s authority to approve software purchases or service contracts involving Protected Data and/or any type of data activity touching UH information systems. VPIT/CIO approval must be granted prior to the procurement process.\n  \n3. Chancellors and System Vice Presidents – Chancellors and system vice presidents (collectively referred to as “UH Leadership”) have authority and responsibility over policies and procedures regarding access and usage of data within their delegations of authority. The VPAPP will consult with UH leadership on strategic matters and conflict resolution issues. The DGC serves in an advisory capacity to UH leadership, providing recommendations for actions. Data Governance Committee (DGC) – A systemwide group dedicated to implementing a data governance program at the University. Committee members are invited by the VPAPP to join.   \n\nThe DGC’s charges are to:   \n  \n1. revise, recommend, and develop policies and standards that govern the University’s data and information management practices at the direction of UH leadership;\n  \n2. define clear and consistent structures, models, and processes that promote the efficient use of resources to meet the information needs of the University community;\n  \n3. provide guidance and recommendations concerning the University’s Institutional Data, including expanding access, improving quality, ensuring data security, and improving performance;\n  \n4. provide recommendations to UH leadership as part of a formal appeal process involving disputes around Institutional Data and Institutional Data Systems.\n  \n4. Student Data Oversight Committee (SDOC) – A DGC subcommittee focused on improving data quality and access and providing guidance on future directions, priorities, and uses of student Institutional Data Systems. The SDOC has the authority to make decisions on student data issues and may recommend to the DGC policies and principles on data management and use.\n  \n5. Institutional Research and Analysis Office (IRAO) Director – A member of the DGC, the IRAO Director oversees the office that is the official reporting entity for student-related data and information for the University of Hawai‘i. The IRAO Director coordinates the cross-functional reporting and analysis of student, finance, and human resource data. The IRAO Director leads the University’s efforts around data quality and works collaboratively with system and campus leadership to improve the consistency and accuracy of data residing within the University’s Institutional Data Systems. The IRAO Director is the System Executive Data Steward for Banner (student module) and its operational data store (ODS).\n  \n6. UH System Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) – A member of the DGC, the CISO leads the University’s Information Security Program. The Information Security Team reports to the CISO  within Information Technology Services (ITS), and works with system and campus leadership to improve the security posture of the University.   \n\nTo meet the requirements of the Information Security Program, ITS has the authority to require that all servers be registered and to implement standard security controls, such as network and server scanning, to identify security weaknesses in any University information system or network that may compromise protected data or the operations and availability of institutional services.   \n\nLikewise, ITS has the authority to enforce technical measures to ensure the protection of Protected Data that are stored or transmitted, whether intentionally or unintentionally, on University systems and networks, including but not limited to the immediate disconnection of compromised systems from the University network.   \n\nThe CISO convenes the systemwide Data Security Leadership Council and the UH Information Technology Security Leads group and updates the DGC on security and privacy issues.\n  \n7. Campus FERPA Officer – The campus registrar serves as a campus-wide technical resource and subject matter expert on FERPA issues, and provides interpretation as needed.\n  \n8. Data Stewards – Data Stewards act in accordance and ensure compliance with applicable federal and state rules and regulations and University policies involving Institutional Data. Data Stewards are responsible for minimizing the use, storage, and exposure of Protected Data, particularly personally identifiable information. They are expected to limit the exposure of such data to only situations that are deemed essential and appropriate.   \n\nThere are two levels of Data Stewards at the University of Hawai‘i: executive and functional.  \n  \n1. Executive Data Stewards are accountable for the use and management of Institutional Data at their respective campus or within the Institutional Data System under their purview.  \n  \n1. Campus Executive Data Stewards  \n  \n1. These Data Stewards are vice chancellors or appropriate administrators responsible for the major functional areas within a campus including, but not limited to, student affairs, academic affairs, and administration. They have the authority to govern the use of Institutional Data within their respective areas.\n  \n2. Campus Executive Data Stewards for student data have the responsibility of reviewing and approving data sharing requests within their respective campuses. As part of the review process, a Campus Executive Data Steward will notify relevant parties of data sharing requests for student-related data through an inclusive and open communication process. Human resource and financial data sharing requests are managed centrally by the UH System Offices of Human Resources and Financial Management.\n  \n2. System Executive Data Stewards  \n  \n1. These Data Stewards are primarily system level executives with functional responsibility for Institutional Data Systems (see section II, Definitions). They have the authority to govern the use of Institutional Data within these Institutional Data Systems.\n  \n2. System Executive Data Stewards review and approve Data Sharing Requests involving multiple campuses, external parties, and/or electronic linkages to Institutional Data Systems. As part of the review process, the System Executive Data Steward will notify relevant parties of Data Sharing Requests through an inclusive and open communication process.\n  \n3. System Executive Data Stewards also have the authority to grant access to Institutional Data Systems for system and campus personnel.\n  \n4. System Executive Data Stewards have the additional responsibility of responding to the data and information needs of the University community through the Institutional Data Systems they oversee. They sponsor and promote a shared understanding of data through clear data element definitions, and oversee data quality and performance improvements within these systems.\n\nRefer to the UH Data Governance website for a listing of Institutional Data Systems and associated Executive Data Stewards.\n  \n2. Functional Data Stewards are responsible for the day-to-day use, management, and distribution of Institutional Data. Functional Data Stewards exist among all levels and across all units within the University. Registrars, financial aid officers, fiscal managers, human resources specialists, and institutional researchers are among those considered Data Stewards.   \n\nFunctional Data Stewards engage in the following types of data related activities:  \n  \n1. Ensure Institutional Data is managed appropriately, according to policies and procedures;\n  \n2. Recommend enhancements for their respective program areas to improve data quality, access, security, performance, and reporting;\n  \n3. Serve as a conduit between functional and technical personnel to promote communication and a shared understanding of requirements;\n  \n4. Fulfill Data Sharing Requests.\n  \n9. Data Custodians – Data Custodians are the managers and/or administrators of systems or media on which protected data reside, including, but not limited to, personal computers, laptop computers, PDAs, smartphones, departmental servers, enterprise databases, storage systems, magnetic tapes, CDs/DVDs, USB drives, paper files, and any other removable or portable devices or off-site storage technologies. These may include, but are not limited to, cloud storage or cloud services. Information technology personnel are commonly regarded as Data Custodians, however, any authorized individual who downloads or stores sensitive information onto a computer or other storage device becomes a Data Custodian through that act.  \n\nData Custodians are responsible for the technical safeguarding of protected data, including implementing and administering controls that ensure the transmission of those protected data are secure and access controls are in place to prevent inappropriate disclosure. This can be as simple as utilizing [UH FileDrop](https://www.hawaii.edu/filedrop/) to transfer Protected Data.\n  \n10. Data Users – UH employees, students, and affiliates who, in order to fulfill their job duties and responsibilities, require access to protected data as defined in Executive Policy [EP 2.214, Institutional Data Classification Categories and Information Security Guidelines](http://hawaii.edu/policy/ep2.214). Data Users are responsible for understanding and complying with applicable University policies and procedures and all recognized federal and state laws for dealing with protected data.  \n\nTo ensure compliance and to meet the objectives of this policy, individuals must complete training requirements as outlined in [AP 2.215, Mandatory Training and Continuing Education Requirements for Data Users](http://hawaii.edu/policy/ap2.215). Those who do not comply will be denied access. Specific questions about the appropriate handling or usage of Institutional Data should be directed to the Executive Data Steward responsible for that area.\n  \nIV.

Purpose\n1. To promulgate provisions implementing Regents Policy 6.203 Fees.\n\nII. Definitions\n1. Chartered Student Organizations (CSOs) are defined by Regents Policy, Chapter 7, RP 7.201 (Student Organizations) and RP 7.202 (Chartered Student Organizations) and conduct activities directly financed through mandatory student fees, also known as mandatory student activity fees as authorized by Section 304A-2257, Hawaii Revised Statutes.\n\n2. Distance programs are programs of study where all courses in the credential are provided via distance technology, and the program has been approved for distance delivery.\n\n3. Definitions of the mandatory student fees\n\n1. Student Activity & Program Fees include those mandatory student activity fees used to foster a vibrant student life and to promote a unique and enriching student educational experience at UH campuses through a diversity of co-curricular student programs, activities, and services. On some campuses, where there is no distinct Student Government Fee, the Student Activity and Program Fees may support the cost of student government.\n\n2. Student Publication Fees include those mandatory student activity fees used to support and govern student publications such as the campus newspaper, literary magazines, e-publications, other print media, and related student advertising sales and promotions, affording students opportunities to write, edit, design, manage, do art, sell ads, conduct promotions, etc. that inform, educate and/or entertain the campus community.\n\n3. Campus Center & Student Recreation Fees include those mandatory student activity fees used to support student-governed, student-serviced, and student-administered facilities, programs, services, and activities that serve as the “living room, hearthstone, or community center” for students, faculty, staff, alumni, and guests of the campus. Taken together, these facilities, programs, services, and activities offer conveniences and amenities that campus community members desire in their daily lives and create a focal point or gathering place where cultural, educational, social, recreational leisure, personal wellness, and physical fitness needs may be met.\n\n1. These fees may also include those mandatory student activity fees used to support campus recreational facilities, programs, services, and activities that promote physical activity and wellness through student usage of indoor and outdoor recreational facilities and student participation in recreational opportunities such as intramural sports, fitness, outdoor adventures, aquatics, and other personal wellness or personal leisure activities.\n\n2. Separate fees may be established to fund principal and interest payments of bonds sold as well as other debt obligations incurred for the construction, repair, renovation, and/or furnishing for facilities; as well as fund the operations of services and programs within campus center and/or student recreational facilities including personnel costs.\n\n4. Student Government Fees include those mandatory student activity fees used to encourage and foster student input, voice, and advocacy of the needs, interests, and concerns of students on campus through purposeful participation in institutional governance. These fees may also support the student government’s sponsorship and funding of pertinent programs, services, and activities. Separate student government fees for undergraduates and graduates may be established given the composition of the campus student population.\n\n5. Campus Communication Fees / Student Broadcast Fees include those mandatory student activity fees used to support and govern student broadcast such as campus radio stations, television programs, film-making projects and other broadcast media, affording students opportunities to produce, engineer, and manage radio broadcasts as well as script write, edit, broadcast report, produce, and manage filmmaking that inform, educate and/or entertain the campus community.\n\n6. Student Health Fees include those mandatory student fees used to provide a level of campus health services which contribute to students’ physical, mental, and emotional well-being in order that they may persist towards their educational objectives.\n\n7. Student Technology Fees include those mandatory student fees used to support computing and technology needs of students through timely repair, replacement, and/or renewal of equipment, infrastructure, and software in a rapidly changing environment and to maintain state-of-the-art technology to aid in academic achievement.\n\n8. Student Transportation / UPASS Fees refer to those mandatory student fees used to support subsidized public transportation services negotiated with governmental entities operating such public transportation. These fees may also support other alternative transportation programs and services that promote sustainability through reduced consumption of fossil fuels among other approaches.\n\n9. Student Athletic Fees refer to those mandatory student fees used to enhance the campus intercollegiate athletic program’s revenue to assist with expenses such as scholarships, travel and subsistence, materials and supplies, and other expenses directly beneficial to student-athletes needed to offer a competitive intercollegiate athletic program given the campus’ designated conferences of competition. These fees shall partially offset ticket costs for seats allocated to students to attend home events, promoting campus spirit and pride. A negotiated portion of these fees shall support a variety of activities for students, including those activities designed to enhance the student experience related to athletics as well as the student’s athletic experience.\n\nIII. Executive Policy This policy shall apply to all campuses of the University of Hawai‘i.\n\n1. Mandatory student fees are clustered into major types: student organization fees and student program fees.\n\nThese mandatory student fees shall be generally assessed of all students. Exceptions are described in Section III.H and I. of this policy for students in distance programs, who are not able to take direct advantage of certain co-curricular programs and opportunities at their campus. A chancellor or provost may authorize exclusions for students in outreach and continuing education programs on their campuses or for students due to their geographic locations.\n\n1. Student Organization fees are generally managed and administered by a recognized student governance organization chartered by the University. These include organizations such as student government, student center board or programming council, student publications board, student broadcast board, and student activity or student life board. Collectively, student governance groups of the University are known as chartered student organizations (CSOs) and are advised and operationally supported by University-assigned faculty or staff typically in a student life / student activities office.\n\n2. Student Program fees are managed and operated by a University office, program, or department with substantive student input. These fees help to support such services as student health centers, student technology centers, student transportation services, and student athletics.\n\n2. A Mandatory Student Fees Schedule shall reflect fee amounts approved by the Board of Regents. Approved fee amounts are made a part of the Fees Schedule codified as appendices located at the end of this policy.\n\n3. Assessment & Collection of Student Fees: As authorized by Board policies and University rules, each campus shall continue its practice of collecting mandatory student fees on behalf of its CSOs, student activity programs, or student programs. These student fees shall automatically be assessed to the student account when a student registers for any course on a campus. A student who registers for courses at more than one campus shall be assessed mandatory student fees of those campuses unless exempted as described in Part III.H and I. of this policy below. Fees may be based on the students’ educational level, degree status, and enrollment status, among other factors.\n\n4. Changes to Student Fee Amounts: CSOs, student activity programs, or student programs may request that its student fee be increased or decreased, or that a new student fee be established. Such requests shall be submitted for Board approval with adequate justification via the appropriate campus chancellor or provost and via the University president. Requests shall clearly explain why the change is necessary and how the change will be used to further the purposes and goals of the CSO, student activity program, or student program. As required by Regents Policy, RP6.203 III.A, operational and financial plans shall accompany requests for new mandatory student fees. Requests shall outline appropriate consultative steps taken by the requesting body with constituents impacted by the fee change. Additionally, requests shall outline how this policy, particularly the Fee Schedule appendices will be amended. Should a multi-year student fee schedule be approved, ending rates for these fees shall remain in effect until the Student Fees Schedule is officially replaced by action of the Board or by delegated authority.\n\n5. Use and Expenditure of Mandatory Student Fees: CSOs, student activity programs, or student programs shall use and expend monies from the student activities revolving fund or other such student fee special or revolving fund for any purpose they deem necessary and proper to carry out and achieve their educational responsibilities, programs, and related activities, provided that the CSO, student activity program, or student program has met its own internal approval requirements and provided that any expenditure of funds is subject to the prior approval of the Board of Regents or its designated representative, the President or designee (HRS 304A-2257).\n\nIn balancing the right of the CSOs, student activity programs, or student programs to use and expend monies from its funds; the legal, fiduciary and administrative responsibility of the Board for such monies; and the co-curricular program objectives of affording students the opportunity to learn to exercise decision-making authority over such monies; all income and expenditures shall be in compliance with applicable laws, rules, policies and procedures of government and the University. As such, ultimate responsibility for the proper financial management of the financial resources and other assets of CSOs, student activity programs, or student programs shall rest with the University program head as defined by University policy.\n\nAll funding decisions regarding the use and expenditure of mandatory student fees must be made without regard to the viewpoint being expressed by a student organization. A student organization cannot be granted or denied funding on the basis of its viewpoint or because it advocates a particular opinion or view. Funding decisions must be based on procedures and criteria that are not tied to the viewpoint expressed by the CSO or the approval, disapproval, acceptance, or rejection of that viewpoint. Viewpoint neutral criteria and processes will be utilized during the decision-making process for any and all funding policies and procedures regarding the expenditure of mandatory student fees that involve expressive activities.\n6. Appeals Process: When concerns arise regarding the expenditure of funds generated by student fees, students may appeal the decision of the University program head to every succeeding level of authority on the campus. This may include both decisions about the expenditure or non-expenditure of funds, such as when the program head does not approve the use and expenditure of monies from the student activities revolving funds or other such student fee special or revolving fund, after the CSO, student activity program, or student program has properly approved such expenditure. Each succeeding level of authority from the program head up through the chancellor or provost of the campus shall render a decision on the appeal within five (5) working days of receiving the appeal. The chancellor or provost of the campus or designee will render a final decision on the appeal within seven (7) working days of receiving the appeal.\n\n7. Annual Budgets and Financial Report: The CSO, student activity program, or student program shall submit an annual budget for University approval as required by Regents Policy, RP7.202 III.C. In the event that a CSO is inactive, full-time personnel in student life, student activities, or student affairs may submit an operating budget to cover operating costs, fixed and otherwise, for approval by the chancellor or provost of the campus via the campus senior student affairs officer. In addition, an annual financial report of actual income and expenditures by the CSOs, student activity programs, or student programs shall be submitted at such time and in such a manner as prescribed by University policy (Executive Policy EP 7.101).\n\n8. Distance Program Students; Concurrently Enrolled Students: The quality and excellence of the University of Hawai‘i rests on both the curricular (academic) and co-curricular (non-academic) programs that campuses offer. Just as tuition assessed by the campus is invested to enhance the educational experience for all its students through its library, labs, technology resources, and classroom facilities, so too are mandatory student fees assessed to enhance the out-of-classroom educational experience for all students through such co-curricular programs as theater, intramural sports, band, intercollegiate athletics, student newspaper, campus radio station, student government, student center, student clubs and organizations, etc.\n\n1. The University values the transformative potential of educational experiences and opportunities offered by the co-curriculum that is available to students. The assessment of mandatory student fees is not dependent on whether a student actually uses specific fee-supported activities, programs, and services. Rather, the assessment of mandatory student fees enables the University to enrich the quality of campus life for its students, maintain its reputation and accreditation, and share the costs of the co-curriculum among all students.\n\n2. All students who register for a course on any campus, including those in distance programs are recognized as members of the student body of the campus offering their courses. As such, all students, including those in distance programs, universally contribute to creating, increasing, and maintaining high quality, affordable co-curricular educational programs.\n\n3. Students shall be required to pay mandatory student fees for student activity & programs, student publications, student government, campus communication/student broadcast, student health, and student technology at all campuses at which they are enrolled, regardless of course modality or program type. These fees support services that are accessible or provide direct benefits regardless of the student’s geographical location. Students enrolled in classes that take place at a UH facility, regardless of how many times the class meets, will additionally be assessed the following campus-based mandatory student fees: campus center & student recreation, student transportation/UPASS, and student athletic fees.\n\n4. Students in distance programs may be physically unable to take direct advantage of certain campus-based co-curricular programs and opportunities. Therefore, they shall be exempt from paying the following campus-based mandatory student fees: campus center & student recreation, student transportation/UPASS, or student athletic fees.\n\n9. Students registered for a course through Cross-Campus Course Sharing (C3S) shall be exempt from additional student fees charged at the offering campus.\n\nIV. Delegation of Authority Responsibility for implementation of this policy shall rest with the chancellor or provost of each campus.\nV.

Purpose University personnel records should be complete, accurate, up-to-date, and safe from improper disclosure. Federal and state laws require that certain information be gathered and maintained in secure personnel files. Sound personnel decisions require that the University collect and retain information concerning employment history and performance. This policy sets forth University expectations, regarding the establishment, use, and maintenance of an employee’s personnel records. \nII. Definitions Employee personnel records are defined to include the application for employment, and records which are used or have been used to determine an employee’s qualifications for promotion, compensation, termination, or disciplinary action. A detailed list of appropriate contents for University employees is provided in Administrative Procedures 9.075, Personnel Records – University of Hawai‘i Employees. \nIII. Executive Policy Due to the decentralized nature of personnel matters at the University, the documents which form an employee’s personnel records may be found (1) on computerized record-keeping systems (e.g., online Human Resources Information System, Online Leave System, online application and recruitment system, etc.) and/or digital imaging systems, (2) in hard copy format at secured spaces at campus or System offices, and (3) as a combination of digital and hard copy personnel documents. All such documents comprise an employee’s personnel records.  \n\nThe Human Resources Information System (e.g., PeopleSoft) is the University’s official repository of all personal data affecting employee’s status and pay.  \n\nAll system-directed changes to personnel records (e.g., change of funding, FTE, tenure status, etc.) and employee self-directed changes to personnel records (e.g., benefits coverage through the State of Hawaii Employee-Union Health Benefits Trust Fund (EUTF), and Employees’ Retirement System (ERS), address, name changes, etc.) shall be managed by the employee's designated HR Representative, except for the following, which are managed through the State of Hawai'i Payroll System: changes in tax withholdings and designation of beneficiary.  See [matrix](https://www.hawaii.edu/ohr/benefits-leave/life-events/) listing systems, forms, and/or documents requiring update based on changes or corrections to personnel records.  \n\nThe University permits an employee or their authorized representative to have access to all data in their personnel record in accordance with Administrative Procedure 9.025, Access to Personal Records. Limitations on access to and disclosure of employee personal records are in accordance HRS 92F.  \n\nPersonnel files are maintained in accordance with Executive Policy 2.216, Institutional Records Management. \nIV. Delegation of Authority Vice Presidents, Associate Vice Presidents, Chancellors, Provosts, Vice Chancellors, Vice Provosts, Deans and Directors who have been delegated personnel functions or their designees (henceforth referred to as the designated Human Resource (HR) Representative) are responsible for the University’s official personnel records and ensuring these records are complete, accurate, up-to-date, and maintained in accordance with applicable University policies and procedures and appropriate collective bargaining agreements. \nV.

Gender-inclusive facility  \n  \nA facility, including but not limited to, restrooms, showers, locker rooms, and changing facilities, that is usable by persons of all gender identities and that is not gender-specific.  \n  \nE.    Gender-specific  \n  \nDesignated for use solely by either men or women.  \n  \nF.    Wellness/Lactation room  \n  \nA private room, other than a restroom, designated for use by students or employees to express breast milk or to breastfeed a child.  \n  \nG.    Multi-stall restroom  \n  \nA restroom that has two or more toilets, each enclosed by its own stall.  \n  \nH.    Single-occupancy family restroom  \n  \nUsually a larger single-occupancy restroom designed to accommodate a person and their attendant, caregiver, or young child and may have baby changing facilities.  \n  \nI.    Single-occupancy restroom  \n  \nA restroom designated for use by one person.    \nIII. Executive Policy  A.  Planning and Establishing Priorities with Accountability.  \n  \nIn consultation with the respective campus student affairs offices, women’s centers, Title IX offices, the UH Commission on Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer+ (LGBTQ+) Equality, and LGBTQ+ Center Directors, each campus should inventory restrooms, showers, locker rooms, and changing facilities and assess current and potential gender-inclusive usability. The campus should also identify needed locations for wellness/lactation rooms accessible to students and employees.  \n  \nThe campus should assign a position or unit to monitor and promote implementation of this policy, and outline priorities for implementation in a transition plan.  \n  \nB.  Gender-Inclusive Facilities Conversion or Construction Guidelines.   \n  \n  1.  Existing Buildings.  \n  \nWhere feasible, all single-occupancy gender-specific restrooms in existing buildings should be converted to single-occupancy gender-inclusive restrooms. As budgets allow, existing buildings that have locker rooms or showers should be modified to have at least one gender-inclusive locker room or shower. If funding is limited, existing gender-specific facilities should be adapted, for example, by adding privacy options such as shower curtains or doors.  \n  \n  2.  Existing restrooms, showers, locker rooms, and changing facilities.  \n  \n  a.  The University will identify and designate existing single-occupancy restrooms as gender-inclusive or “all gender,” to the extent feasible. This will provide safe, comfortable options for persons regardless of their gender identity. This will also accommodate parents and caregivers who are a different gender from their children, as well as attendants and personal aides who are a different gender.  \n  \n  b.  With regard to existing gender-specific lockers, showers, and changing facilities, appropriate accommodations will be made to the extent feasible.  \n  \n  c.  With regard to wellness/lactation rooms, each campus should identify at least one appropriate space that is private and comfortable, other than a restroom.  \n  \n  3.  New Building Construction or Major Building Renovation.  \n  \n  a.  The University is also committed to increasing gender-inclusive and accessible options, including creating more single-occupancy gender-inclusive restrooms, Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) accessible restrooms and family restrooms, and gender-inclusive showers, locker rooms and changing facilities.  \n  \n  b. These facilities should be inclusively designed as feasible to be usable by and accessible to as many people as reasonably possible. Availability of inclusive facilities is optimal from the perspective of ADA universal design for persons who may need to be accompanied by personal attendants, and parents and caregivers with children of a different gender, as well as to provide safe and comfortable options for persons regardless of their gender identity.  \n  \n  c.  For each new building being constructed or each building undergoing major renovation, the scope of work should include at least one gender-inclusive restroom. Where feasible, the gender-inclusive restrooms should be located in close proximity to the gender-specific restrooms. If allowed by codes, the scope of work may incorporate multi-stall gender-inclusive restrooms in high traffic areas or buildings with high occupancy loads.  \n  \n  d.  If the building being constructed or renovated has or is anticipated to have locker rooms or showers, then to the extent feasible, the building should have at least one gender-inclusive locker room or shower in close proximity to the gender-specific locker room or shower.  \n  \n  e.  If it is reasonable to expect that a building being constructed or renovated will be patronized regularly by families, then the gender-inclusive restroom, where feasible, should be equipped with a baby changing table and sized with sufficient space to accommodate a caregiver and baby gear. Where feasible and as needed, the building being constructed or renovated should also have at least one wellness/lactation room in an accessible location. This should be a private locked room or other private space (not in a restroom) preferably with electrical outlets and in close proximity to a sink.  \n  \nC.  Other considerations.  \n  \n  1.  All design, new construction, renovation, or conversion of gender-inclusive facilities should comply with the applicable federal and state laws, and building codes.  \n  \n  2.  The UH Commission on LGBTQ+ Equality or LGBTQ+ Center Directors should be consulted regarding preferred floor location for single-occupancy gender-inclusive restrooms, since the first floor may not be ideal for single-occupancy gender-inclusive restrooms.  \n  \n  3.  The signage for gender-inclusive restrooms should state “RESTROOM” or “ALL GENDER RESTROOM,” with no other gender-specific designation. If the restroom is new or has been renovated, the sign should also include the ADA pictogram and be ADA and building code compliant.  \n  \n  4.  Single-use facilities should ideally have door hardware that displays the word “occupied” when in use.  \n  \n  5.  If gender-inclusive restrooms include multi-stall facilities, these should be designed to ensure optimum privacy, such as ensuring secured locks on restroom or stall doors. Other measures may include: installing flaps on the outer edge of stall doors to cover gap between the door and the stall wall and extending stall partitions to increase privacy (but not necessarily floor-to-ceiling).  \n  \n  6.  Location of all of these inclusive facilities should be posted on the respective campus websites for quick access and location.    \nIV.

Purpose\n1. To increase the educational opportunities available to all University of Hawai‘i students by leveraging the Universityʻs full academic portfolio. This will, in turn, facilitate studentsʻ timely graduation while supporting UH transfer pathways.\n\n2. To establish a procedure to allow for the full and effective utilization of the academic and non-academic resources of the University, especially so that students can meet academic program requirements within a reasonable period of time.\n\n3. To establish guidelines and procedures under which students may enroll at two or more University of Hawai‘i campuses in the same semester.\n\n4. To establish a procedure that allows a class taught at one campus to be made available for student registration at other campuses using cross-campus course sharing (C3S).\n\nII. Definitions\n1. “Concurrent Registration” means registration at a home campus and at one or more other campuses of the University of Hawai‘i in the same semester, according to the procedures outlined herein.\n\n2. “Concurrent Registrant” means a student who participates in concurrent registration.\n\n3. “Home Campus” means the campus at which a student is pursuing a certificate, a diploma, or a degree.\n\n4. “Cross-campus course sharing (C3S)” means classes that are taught at one campus (offering campus) and are linked and listed at another campus or campuses and available for students at other UH campuses to enroll. \n\n5. “Offering campus” means the campus where the instructor of record will teach the course.\n\nIII. Executive Policy\n1. Students who are enrolled at or admitted to any UH institution will be eligible to register at any of the community colleges without having to apply for admission at the other community college campuses.  Students will be able to take non-restricted courses at the community college campuses for which they qualify (e.g., meet prerequisite, major or other requirements).\n\n2. Students at any of the four-year UH institutions may register in unrestricted courses at the community colleges.  Community college students may register at other community colleges; however, community college students may not register for courses at the four-year universities unless they have been formally admitted or the class in question is made available to them through cross-campus course sharing.  Likewise, students at one four-year institution may not take regular courses at another four-year institution, unless they have been formally admitted or the class in question is made available to them through C3S.\n\n3. Cross-campus course sharing (C3S) may occur between or among any of the UH campuses.   \n\n1. From a student perspective, registration for classes shared across campuses follows the standard registration process except that the student will be notified that the course is not being taught at their home campus.\n\n2. The approval of the offering campus is required for each class included in the C3S.\n\n4. A concurrent registrant who is a recipient of financial aid must consult with their home campus Financial Aid Office to determine any impact on their financial aid resulting from concurrent enrollment.\n\n5. An international student who is a concurrent registrant must consult with their home campus advisor regarding U.S. Center of Immigration Services requirements.\n\n6. A concurrent registrant cannot pursue degrees from more than one campus simultaneously unless under the reverse transfer provision in EP 5.209.\n\nIV.

Purpose To implement Board of Regents policy, [RP 7.205](http://www.hawaii.edu/policy/index.php?action=viewPolicy&policySection=rp&policyChapter=7&policyNumber=205&menuView=closed), relating to student housing rate-setting procedures at the University of Hawai‘i.    \nII. Definitions No policy specific or unique definitions apply.    \nIII. Executive Policy 1. In accordance with [RP 7.205](http://www.hawaii.edu/policy/index.php?action=viewPolicy&policySection=rp&policyChapter=7&policyNumber=205&menuView=closed), the President delegates to the chancellors of the respective campuses the authority to establish student housing room rates, as well as meal plan rates, using the process set forth below.  \n2. The procedures shall ensure that: 1. Students and others are provided with timely notice, distribution, and explanation of student housing rate proposals, and  2. Students and others have the opportunity to provide input on University of Hawai'i student housing rate proposals.\n3. Student Housing Rate – Setting Procedure  In accordance with the policy requirements summarized above, University procedures for setting housing rates, including meal plan rates, are as follows.  1. Consistent with Board of Regents policy, the campus administration develops proposed student housing rate and meal plan schedules (collectively referred to hereafter as the rate proposal).  In determining the specific student housing rate and meal plan schedules, the campus administration shall use its best efforts to ensure that the student housing room and meal plan rates are fair and equitable with respect to the level and quality of services provided to those upon whom the rates are imposed, while ensuring sufficient funds and resources are available to fulfill such services and meet any unusual or unforeseen costs.    2. The rate proposal shall be distributed in written format at least 15 working days in advance of the open public meetings called for below.  Distribution of the rate proposal shall be made to the president and vice president for budget and finance/CFO, student housing residents and student government leaders electronically and through postings in common areas.  The published rate proposal shall include a request for written comments, which are to be submitted to the respective campus student housing office no later than 15 working days from the date of the public meeting.  3. The campus administration shall be available to respond to students and others on the rate proposal.  4. The campus administration shall conduct at least two open public meetings on the rate proposal.  Public meetings are announced at least 15 days in advance.  Meeting notices are disseminated via campus newspapers or other appropriate means, and should be provided together with the publication of the rate proposals as set forth in section C.2. above.  These public meetings shall take place on the campus impacted and be scheduled outside of vacation days and final exam week.  They are held for the purpose of:  1. Explaining the rate proposal to affected students (electronic media may be used to assist with this process); and   2. Affording affected students and other interested parties the opportunity to provide input on the rate proposal.  Members of the campus administration shall be present to respond to questions and receive input. 5. The campus vice chancellor for student affairs reviews comments and testimony received on the rate proposal, provides the vice chancellor for administration and chancellor with a summary of the feedback collected at the open public meetings, and recommends any revisions to the rate proposal as appropriate.  6. A final rate proposal should be presented to the campus chancellor for approval no later than thirty (30) days before the end of the semester preceding the semester in which the proposed rates would apply.  The chancellor may approve the proposal, modify it, or reject it.    7. Posting of approved new rates on the appropriate student housing websites should occur no later than the last day of the semester preceding the semester in which the approved rate applies, and optimally by March 1 for Fall semester increases.  The President and the Board of Regents’ Office shall be notified in writing of any approved new rates.\nIV. Delegation of Authority In accordance with [RP 7.205](http://www.hawaii.edu/policy/index.php?action=viewPolicy&policySection=rp&policyChapter=7&policyNumber=205&menuView=closed), the President delegates to the chancellors of the respective campuses the authority to establish student housing room rates, as well as meal plan rates, using the process set forth herein.    \nV.

Purpose  A.  Directs implementation of Regents Policy 5.201, Section III.E.  \n  \nB.  Provides for the systematic review and evaluation of all established academic  programs at the University of Hawai‘i.  \n  \nC.  Objectives of policy  \n  \n    1.  To facilitate an evidence-based process of periodic review of all established programs by faculty, disciplinary experts and administration. This process is designed to reveal strengths and challenges, and ensure program effectiveness with respect to the discipline, university policy, and external accreditation standards. It examines the extent to which established academic programs are meeting their stated objectives and whether these objectives are still relevant in relation to the campus, unit and university missions.  \n  \n    2.  To establish guidelines and procedures for the preparation and processing of reviews of established programs.  \n  \n    3.  To assure the administration and Board of Regents that appropriate follow-up activities are undertaken in response to concerns addressed by the review and that the program review is integrated into the planning and budgetary process of the campus.    \nII. Definitions  A.  Established Program: For the purposes of the program review, an established program is one that has been approved by the Board of Regents or is an instructional area that utilizes substantial University resources.  \n          \nB.  Stop-Out: Students are not admitted to a program because the program is being reevaluated.    \nIII. Executive Policy  A.     Review guidelines and schedule  \n  \n    1.    The Chancellors of the four-year institutions and the Vice President for Community Colleges shall develop implementing procedures and schedules appropriate for their campuses.  \n  \n    2.    All established programs are subject to review at a minimum of every seventh year for four-year institutions and every fifth year at the community colleges.  \n  \n    3.    Completed reviews are archived at each campus and shall be available upon request.  \n  \nB.    Program Review  \n  \n    1.    Includes a self-study that  \n  \n        a. Is aligned to regional accreditation standards.  \n  \n        b. Addresses at a minimum the guidelines in Appendix A.  \n  \n        c. Includes a quantitative profile of program activity (Appendix B) that is used for analysis.  \n  \n        d. Involves, as appropriate, students and faculty in the self-study process.  \n  \n    2.    Review of self-study by well-qualified internal and/or external reviewers.  \n  \n    3.    Results are discussed with administration and an action plan prepared.  \n  \n    4.    Results are integrated in the planning and budget process.  \n  \n    5.    There is regular follow-up of results, as needed.  \n  \nC.    Self-study documents completed as part of an accreditation review conducted by a federally-recognized accrediting body (including professional accreditation organizations) may be submitted in lieu of the program self-study detailed above.  \n  \nD.    If a program review identifies a need for more thorough examination of specific issues or areas of concern, the appropriate administrative office (dean/chair/director, etc.) will create a plan for addressing the recommendations and submit it to the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs. The unit will develop a mechanism for periodical revisits of the program plans to ensure that adequate progress is made on each of the identified areas of concern.  \n  \nE.    A list of the program reviews completed are submitted annually to the Board of Regents.  \n  \nF.    A review of a program may be undertaken at any time as deemed necessary by the faculty or administration. The Chancellor may, if he/she determines it appropriate, approve a “stop-out” admission of new students to a program undergoing a special review. Such a program shall be identified as “stopped-out” in appropriate publications and the like. Students already admitted to a program at the time of the stop-out shall be permitted to complete their studies.  \n  \nThe Office of the President will annually report stop-outs. The campuses assume responsibility for informing students, including new applicants, of stop-out actions. University admissions documents will be adjusted in as timely a fashion as possible. Stopped-out programs will be retained in the University’s official curricula listing, with appropriate notation.    \nIV. Delegation of Authority  A.  The Chancellors establish a schedule and internal procedures for carrying out the program review.  \n  \nB.  Chancellors may approve a “stop-out” of admission to a program.    \nV.

Purpose To provide guidance relating to the implementation of Board of Regents Policy RP 10.205, Use of University Owned Facilities.\nII. Definitions No policy specific or unique definitions apply.\nIII. Executive Policy A. Responsibilities and Priorities\n1. Chancellors are responsible for developing and implementing procedures governing the application and reservation for use of designated facilities under their respective jurisdictions (see Delegation of Authority EP 10.101).\n2. In order to implement the Regents Policy in the spirit with which it was adopted, the Chancellors shall seek input from campus organizations. Chancellors responsible for multiple campuses need to coordinate procedures and have them applied uniformly.\n3. User Categories: The Chancellor of the institution must define University affiliated organization and non-university affiliated organization. Written procedures must be developed to allow non-affiliated organizations to apply for affiliation.\n4. Facilities Use Agreement: The Chancellor of the institution is responsible for developing a facilities use agreement form and use rates. Use rates must cover the cost to operate and maintain the facilities during its use.\n5. Use Priorities: Use priorities must be consistent with the Board policy. First priority is given to regular educational functions followed by registered student, faculty & staff organizations and other University-affiliated organizations. Lower priority would be provided organizations without University affiliation. Priorities must be developed as part of the facilities use procedures for each campus.\n6. A University program should not make outgoing payments under an agreement for the use of a University-owned facility by a non- University affiliated organization. If a situation exists involving such use of a University-owned facility whereby a University program is also required to remit payment for goods and/or services to the non-University affiliated organization, the Administrative Procedures for Procurement shall apply and such payment shall be processed under a separate agreement. Exceptions to this procedure must be approved by the respective campus chancellor and the President.\nB. Organizations without University affiliation which have obtained approval to use campus facilities shall be required to:\n1. Observe established University and campus rules and policies.\n2. Indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the University and the State of Hawai‘i from any liability arising out of the actions of the organization or its agents incidental to the use of the facilities by the organization.\n3. Reimburse the University for any damage (beyond normal wear and tear) to the facilities resulting from their use.\n4. Compensate the University according to the terms provided in the agreement for use of University owned facilities.\n5. Provide evidence of appropriate and adequate insurance protection covering property damage, personal injury, or death arising out of the use of University owned facilities. The Chancellor may waive this requirement upon an adequate showing of responsibility by the organization.\n6. Remit to the University the full amount of the flat rate use fee prior to the event. If the facilities use agreement includes a flat rate fee amount plus a percentage of sales for the event, the full amount of the flat rate fee shall be paid to the University prior to the event. The percentage of sales shall be paid to the University within THIRTY (30) consecutive calendar days following the event.\nThese rules should be included in the Facilities Use Procedures for each campus.\nC. Public Forum Area\n1. The Chancellor shall designate one or more appropriate public forum areas on their respective campuses where individuals may assemble and engage in public speech activities.\n2. Individuals utilizing a designated public forum area on campus must comply with University and campus rules and policies.\n3. Procedures governing time, place, and manner of public speech activities and manner of such activities, including the location and use of sound amplification equipment, distribution of newspapers, notices, pamphlets and other printed or written material and posting of notices, posters, and other printed or written material. As determined by the Chancellor, consultations may be initiated with the Office of the General Counsel, as it relates to legal interpretations and other legal services, as appropriate.\nD. Solicitation: Procedures must be developed governing solicitation activities as well as excepted activities as provided in Hawai‘i Administrative Rules Section 20-13-7.\nE. Violation: Rules governing violation of the procedure must also be developed.\nF. Sponsorship: University affiliated organizations can sponsor other organizations and thereby qualify for use of University facilities. The Chancellor of the institution must stipulate these rules for sponsorship.\nG. Denial of Use: Organizations seeking use of University facilities should have an appeal process to follow if denied use. If organizations seeking approval are denied use, an appeal process must be available to hear the appeal of the organization. The appeal process must identify the individual position within the University of Hawai‘i who has the authority to render a final decision on the appeal.\nH. Enforcement: Chancellors shall designate an individual to enforce the policies and procedures, governing the use of campus facilities.\nIV. Delegation of Authority There is no policy specific delegation of authority.\nV.

    "text": "Executive Policy 1.206\n\nTitle  Whistleblower and Retaliation Policy    \nHeader  Executive Policy 1.206  \nWhistleblower and Retaliation Policy  \nExecutive Policy Chapter 1, General Provisions  \nExecutive Policy 1.206, Whistleblower and Retaliation Policy  \nEffective Date:  May 2019  \nPrior Dates Amended:  None  \nResponsible Office:  Office of Risk Management  \nGoverning Board of Regents Policy: [RP 2.205](https://www.hawaii.edu/policy?action=viewPolicy&policySection=Rp&policyChapter=2&policyNumber=205), Policy on Whistleblowing and Retaliation  \nReview Date:  May 2022    \nI. Purpose  This policy is intended to promote an atmosphere at the University of Hawai'i (“University”) that allows individuals to disclose in good faith violations of law, regulation or policy, and to protect individuals from retaliation by adverse academic or employment action taken as a result of a good faith report of suspected wrongful conduct.    \n  \nAs a public institution, the University and its members (faculty, staff, students and administrators) have a responsibility to conduct their affairs ethically and in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and policies.  \n  \nThis policy is intended to supplement and not supersede the Hawai'i Whistleblowers’ Protection Act, [Hawai'i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 378-62](https://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/hrscurrent/Vol07_Ch0346-0398/HRS0378/HRS_0378-0062.htm), and existing policies prohibiting retaliation for good faith reporting of violations of law, regulation and policy. This policy is not intended to provide an additional avenue for seeking redress on a claim that has already been adjudicated under another existing policy.    \nII. Definitions  “Good Faith Report” – An allegation of misconduct made to the University with a reasonable belief in the truth of the allegation.  An allegation is not made in good faith if it is knowingly false, or made with reckless disregard for or willful ignorance of facts that would disprove the allegation.  \n  \n“Interference” – Direct or indirect use of authority or influence to obstruct an individual’s right to make a protected disclosure.  \n  \n“Member of the University” – Faculty, staff, students, and administrators.  \n  \n“Misconduct” – A violation of state or federal law or regulation; a serious violation of University policy (including faculty and staff ethical standards or student conduct code), the substantive use of University property, assets, resources, equipment, authority, services or cash for personal gain or other non-University-related purposes except as provided under University policy; fraud; gross incompetence; economic waste or other forms of gross inefficiency; or conditions that may significantly endanger the health or safety of University  employees, students, and/or the general public.  \n  \n“Protected Disclosure” – A Good Faith Report about actual or suspected Misconduct carried out by a Member of the University based on reasonable belief that the conduct has both occurred and is wrongful under applicable law, regulation and/or University policy.    \n  \n“Retaliation” – Any adverse academic or employment action or credible threat of an adverse academic or employment action taken by the University or its Member(s), in response to a whistleblower’s Good Faith Report of Misconduct.  “Retaliation” does not include an institution’s decision to investigate a Good Faith Report of Misconduct.  \n  \n“Whistleblower” – An individual who makes a Good Faith Report, or indicates intent to make a Good Faith Report, or what is perceived to be a Good Faith Report of Misconduct by a Member of the University.    \nIII. Executive Policy 1. General Policy  \n  \nThe University is committed to compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and to promulgate policies and procedures to interpret and apply these laws and regulations in the University setting.  To achieve compliance, the policy of the University is to encourage and enable any Member of the University or the general public, to make Good Faith Reports of Misconduct as Protected Disclosures.  Individuals who make a Good Faith Report in accordance with this policy are protected from retaliatory academic or employment action including discharge, reassignment, demotion, suspension, harassment, or other discrimination. 2. Policy Implementation 1. Reporting  \n  \nAny individual having reason to believe that a Member of the University has engaged in Misconduct, can report suspected Misconduct to the appropriate contacts as they are so designated under applicable University policies and procedures.  Unless the complaining individual believes the responsible office or contact may be involved, suspected Misconduct should be reported to the University office or contact responsible for the policy area, e.g., allegations of financial fraud should be reported to the office of the chief financial officer for the campus or System level.    \n  \nA report should be made in writing to the extent possible, and should include a detailed description of the facts, supporting evidence, and any witnesses.    \n  \nIn the alternative, an individual may also report suspected Misconduct on an anonymous, confidential basis through the [University’s Whistleblower Hotline](https://secure.ethicspoint.com/domain/media/en/gui/40480/index.html), or by telephone at 1-855-874-2849. 2. Investigation of Allegations of Misconduct  \n  \nUpon the responsible office receiving a Good Faith Report of Misconduct, the University will determine appropriate action including any investigation and appropriate resolution of the matter, in accordance with applicable University policies.  If an investigation is conducted, the University will notify the individual UH Member suspected of the Misconduct and may interview members of the faculty, staff and student body or other relevant witnesses to gather all information necessary to investigate the matter.  The University regards confidentiality as fundamentally important for both whistleblowers and respondents, and will make every reasonable effort to conduct investigations in a confidential manner, subject to and in accordance with applicable policies, procedures, and collective bargaining agreements.    \n      \nAfter complaints are disclosed, Whistleblowers are advised to continue to perform assigned duties responsibly.  \n  \nSteps may be taken as interim measures, when situations warrant, to protect complainants during investigations, and examples may include temporary work relocation, temporary reassignment, temporary shift to another supervisor, change in graduate program chair or advisor (students), or alternative work schedule. 3. Protection from Retaliation  \n  \nAfter complaints are disclosed, Whistleblowers are advised to immediately report any perceived Retaliation.

Persons receiving medical or dental care from the University that is open to the general public.  \n\n  \nFor the purpose of this policy, a sheltered college class refers to credit and non-credit classes that are offered to a group solely comprised of high school students and are taught by college-approved faculty, regardless of location. Note that persons admitted to the University as a student and who are registered to participate in a non-sheltered college class (including but not limited to Running Start and Early Admit) are excluded from the definition of Covered Program Minors.\n  \n                            7. **Mandated Reporter** : All persons working in a Covered Program or who have contact with Covered Program Minors, including University employees, contractors, and volunteers, are required to immediately make an oral report to at least one of the following agencies when, in their professional capacity, they have reason to believe that child abuse and/or neglect has occurred or that there exists a substantial risk that child abuse and/or neglect will occur in the reasonably foreseeable future:  \n\n                               1.

This includes ensuring that Covered Program Minors are supervised by adults (including parents or guardians) at all times.  For purposes of this policy only, a University Community Member is any person who is:  \n\n                               1. An officer or other University official;\n  \n                               2.

Similar to University Community Members, Non-UH Volunteers are expected to foster and maintain an appropriate and secure environment for Covered Program Minors.  This includes ensuring that Covered Program Minors are supervised by adults (including parents or guardians) at all times.\n  \nIII. Executive Policy \n                            1. **Policy Statement**  \nThe University is committed to providing a safe environment for everyone participating in the University’s programs and activities, whether on or off campus, and in non-University programs and activities using University facilities, including but not limited to sports camps, academic and personal enrichment programs, and research studies.\n  \n                            2. **Scope**  \nThis policy applies to University Community Members, Applicants, Non-UH Volunteers, members of University-affiliated organizations, and contractors or other individuals employed or otherwise affiliated with non-University organizations who take part in Covered Programs.  The policy also establishes minimum standards for performing background checks and training for individuals who take part in a Covered Program.  \n  \nThis policy is not applicable to:  \n\n                               1. Events or activities that are open to the general public, where parents/guardians/teachers are expected to provide supervision of minors, e.g., fairs, festivals, entertainment events, sporting events, youth visiting the campus on their own or simply using University facilities;\n  \n                               2. Official University admissions-related activities for prospective students, including alumni interviews, visits by candidates for admission and pre-enrollment services, and visits by prospective students and student athletes; however, University Community Members engaged in such activities are responsible for understanding and complying with the Guidelines for Interacting with Minors (see Appendix 1). Covered Programs will provide copies of the guidelines to relevant parties and determine whether additional procedures, such as training and screening, are required;\n  \n                               3. Minors who are student employees are covered by other University policies pertaining to students and employees.  \n  \nNote, however, this policy may still be applicable to minors who are paid, e.g., paid internships, that are part of a Covered Program.  Hiring managers are responsible for understanding and complying with the Guidelines for Interacting with Minors (Appendix 1).  Covered Programs will determine whether additional procedures, such as training and screening, are required;\n  \n                               4. Research protocols involving minors as human subjects, which are subject to the requirements specified by the relevant Institutional Review Board; and\n  \n                               5. Educational activities offered to schools where teachers are expected to provide supervision of minors or other activities, e.g., field trips and campus tours by the Department of Education schools.\n  \n                               6. Programs conducted by outside entities within or involving UH Manoa conference housing.  From time to time, the University rents or otherwise makes available its conference housing facilities to outside entities that operate programs or activities not closely associated with an established University academic, scientific, research or educational program and which minors will be physically present and participate.  All such entities must sign an appropriate agreement with the University that governs their use of the conference housing facilities.  Outside entities are responsible for: (a) the appropriate conduct, training, certification and oversight of their employees, volunteers, participants, agents and third parties involved with the outside entity’s program or activity, including the use of conference housing facilities, (b) enforcing policies and standards for the protection and safety of minors established by the outside entity and conditions that may be required by the University for the protection and safety of minors and (c) ensuring the appropriate supervision of any minors who participate in their programs or activities, including during any stays at the conference housing facilities.\n  \n                            3. **Covered Programs**  \n\n                               1. Covered Programs shall develop specific policies and procedures tailored to the complexity and scale of their programs that meet or exceed the minimum standards set forth in this policy.  To the extent there are inconsistencies between this policy and the policies of such Covered Programs, the policies of such Covered Programs shall control.\n  \n                               2. If a Covered Program seeks to incorporate more rigorous background checks on Candidates than described herein, they may do so upon approval of the Responsible Campus Official.\n  \n                               3. Covered Programs must submit a new Covered Program registration request annually.\n  \n                               4. Covered Programs are responsible for covering the cost of expenditures associated with the background check process.\n  \n                            4. **Responsible Campus Official’s Responsibilities**  \nThe Provost/Chancellors of UH four-year campuses and the Vice President for Community Colleges shall designate an executive University employee as a Responsible Campus Official. The Responsible Campus Official shall:  \n\n                               1. Review, approve, and maintain registration requests for Covered Programs submitted by the Covered Program Administrators;  \n  \nIn cases where it is unclear whether a program can be considered a “Covered Program,” the Responsible Campus Official may consult with the Vice President for Academic Strategy or his or her designee;\n  \n                               2. Ensure that the Mandated Reporter requirements are followed and documented, as related in Section J, Reporting Abuse and Inappropriate Activity Involving Minors.  In cases where Mandated Reporter obligations may be triggered, the Responsible Campus Official should also consult with the appropriate Title IX Coordinator.\n  \n                            5. **Covered Program Administrator’s Responsibilities**  \nThe responsibilities of a Covered Program Administrator are to:  \n\n                               1. Register and obtain approval from the respective Responsible Campus Official to host a Covered Program.\n  \n                               2. Upon approval of the Covered Program, ensure all required permissions are obtained for:  \n\n                                  1. the use of any University facilities,\n                                  2. authorization by the Candidate to check the Candidate’s criminal history.\n  \n                               3. Ensure that Candidates are:  \n\n                                  1. vetted with up to three (3) reference checks prior to being screened in accordance with Section III.G, Background Checks. If there is a break in service greater than one (1) year between appointments to Covered Programs, Candidates will be subject to an additional background check, including fingerprinting.\n                                  2. deemed suitable for participation in the Covered Program; and \n                                  3. successfully trained as required in Section III.H.  The Covered Program Administrator is also responsible for creating and facilitating additional Covered Program-specific training, if applicable. \n  \n                               4. Notify relevant Candidates that their fingerprints will be retained by the Hawai‘i Criminal Justice Data Center (“HCJDC”) and the FBI.\n  \n                               5. Provide Covered Persons with the following:  \n\n                                  1. A copy of the Guidelines for Interacting with Minors (Appendix 1), as well as to other adult participants for broader circulation.\n                                  2. Identification to designate them as Covered Persons.\n  \n                               6. Ensure that Covered Persons have acknowledged that they have read and understood Executive Policy EP2.202, Safety and Protection of Minors prior to participating in the Covered Program.\n  \n                               7. Determine whether a Covered Person may be alone with a minor on a limited basis due to the pedagogical or health-related nature of the Covered Program. Examples may include tutoring, music lessons, speech therapy, and medical, dental or optical services which may require one-on-one contact with a minor.\n  \n                               8. Establish specific policies and procedures that promote the safety and well-being of participants in Covered Programs, including the development of emergency plans and requisite participation and consent forms commensurate with Covered Program characteristics such as type, participant profile, duration, etc.  \n  \nFor Covered Programs with residential and/or overnight components, additional considerations include curfews, quiet hours, overnight guests, overnight absences, residence supervision, restricted physical access, drugs and alcohol, gambling, parties, emergency contacts, etc.\n  \n                               9. Immediately contact the Responsible Campus Official to open an investigation if there is suspected physical abuse or sexual abuse and a reasonable cause to believe a crime has been committed;\n  \n                               10. Establish a grievance procedure to handle complaints from Covered Program participants, parents and/or guardians in a prompt and equitable manner.\n  \n                            6. **Background Check Coordinator’s Responsibilities**  \nThe responsibilities of a Background Check Coordinator (“BCC”) are to coordinate the background check process for programs, pursuant to Sections III.B and III.C of Administrative Procedure AP2.202, Background Check Process for University Community Members and Non-UH Volunteers.  The BCC will:  \n\n                               1. Clarify with the Candidate, as needed, the information the Candidate submitted during the background check process;\n  \n                               2. Ensure the background check was conducted in a manner consistent with State and federal criminal history record checks, which includes fingerprinting and searches of the Hawai‘i Sex Offender Registry and National Sex Offender Public Registry.\n  \n                               3. Be responsible for securing each Candidate’s background check results into the University’s repository.\n  \n                               4. Evaluate and issue a determination on a Candidate’s prospective suitability for a program with minors based on results of criminal background check.\n  \n                            7. **Background Check**  \n\n                               1. Candidates (i.e., University Community Members and Non-UH Volunteers) who qualify and wish to participate in a Covered Program will be required to submit background check application forms and must be cleared to serve.\n  \n                               2. University Community Members will be subject to the following:  \n\n                                  1. State criminal history record check;\n                                  2. National criminal history record check, which involves a fingerprinting requirement;\n                                  3. Sex offender registry check through the Hawai‘i Sex Offender Registry and National Sex Offender Public Registry;\n                                  4. Motor vehicle driving record search, if driving is a requirement of the Covered Program.\n  \n                               3. Non-UH Volunteers will be subject to the same requirements with the exception of item 2.b. No action is required by Non-UH Volunteers.  \n  \nSpecific responsibilities, requirements and procedures for background screening are set forth in Administrative Procedure AP2.202.\n  \n                               4. Any Covered Person participating in a program with the State of Hawai‘i Department of Education (“DOE”) including, but not limited to, Early College programs (where sheltered college classes are offered to groups of high school students) who has undergone a background check through the DOE does not need to complete a background check through the University.\n  \n                               5. Any Covered Person who has undergone a background check process with a Covered Program that uses the services of a third party, and whose process is consistent with this policy and Administrative Procedure AP2.202, may not need to complete a background check through the University.\n  \n                               6. The BCC will conduct the requisite criminal history record, sex offender, and motor vehicle driving record checks for Candidates.  A complete review of such checks/searches must be completed not more than ninety (90) calendar days prior to the commencement of a Covered Program.  The BCC will render a decision of suitability for participation in a program with minors.\n  \n                            8. **Training**       \nUniversity Community Members and Non-UH Volunteers who are specifically responsible for the custody, control or supervision of minors participating in University “Covered Programs” are expected to adhere to training and screening requirements.    \n\n                               1. University Community Members or Non-UH Volunteers who have been accepted to participate in a Covered Program are considered Covered Persons. Covered Persons must complete the University’s Safety and Protection of Minors training module prior to their start date. The training materials are available at https://www.hawaii.edu/minors-on-campus. The training program covers the following.  \n\n                                  1. University policies regarding interactions with Covered Program Minors;\n                                  2. Background check requirement under this policy;\n                                  3. Examples of appropriate and inappropriate behavior with minors, as outlined in the Guidelines for Interacting with Minors;\n                                  4. Behavioral signs that a minor may be a victim of abuse or neglect; and\n                                  5. Reporting requirements and procedures for suspicion that a minor may be a victim of abuse or neglect.\n  \n                               2. The training program pursuant to this policy is a minimum requirement.  The need for additional training specific to a Covered Program will be determined by the Responsible Campus Official, as appropriate.  Additional training regarding child abuse and neglect is offered by Department of Health and Human Services, Child Welfare Services.\n  \n                               3. The Covered Program Administrator shall be responsible for ensuring that all Covered Persons in their Covered Program(s) have successfully completed training prior to involvement in the Covered Program.  Training for Covered Persons must be retaken every two (2) years.\n  \n                               4. Training for Responsible Campus Officials and Covered Program Administrators must be retaken every two (2) years.\n  \n                            9. **Data Security and Retention**  \n\n                               1. Background check information is highly confidential; therefore access to the data is limited to only a handful of individuals who require it to fulfill their professional responsibilities. The data are classified as Sensitive and must therefore be protected according to EP2.214, Institutional Data Classification Categories and Information Security Guidelines.\n  \n                               2. Results from the state and federal criminal history record checks for Covered Persons who are University Community Members and Non-UH Volunteers shall be retained for three (3) years after which they shall be destroyed.\n  \n                            10. **Reporting Abuse and Inappropriate Activity Involving Minors**  \n\n                               1. For purposes of this policy, the applicable definition of “child abuse or neglect” is that used in Hawai‘i Revised Statutes Chapter 350 which provides in relevant part, “Child abuse or neglect” means “the acts or omissions of any person who, or legal entity which, is in any manner or degree related to the child, is residing with the child, or is otherwise responsible for the child's care, that have resulted in the physical or psychological health or welfare of the child, who is under the age of eighteen, to be harmed, or to be subject to any reasonably foreseeable, substantial risk of being harmed.”\n  \n                               2. Any Covered Person who has reason to believe that child abuse and/or neglect, as defined by Hawai‘i Revised Statutes Chapter 350, has occurred on University property or while off campus during official University business or at a University-sponsored event or has reason to believe that there exists a substantial risk that child abuse and/or neglect will occur in the reasonably foreseeable future shall have an affirmative obligation to immediately report such conduct to at least one of the following agencies:  \n\n                                  1. The Department of Human Services (Child Welfare Services) http://humanservices.hawaii.gov/ssd/home/child-welfare-services/; or\n                                  2. The police department.\n  \n                               3. After a report is made to the Department of Human Services (Child Welfare Services) and/or to the policy department, a report must then be made with the applicable campus or University’s public safety department. An initial verbal report shall be followed as soon as possible by a written report.  All written reports shall contain the name and address of the child and the child's parents or other persons responsible for the child's care, if known, the child's age, the nature and extent of the child's injuries, and any other information that the reporter believes might be helpful or relevant to the investigation of the child abuse or neglect.\n  \n                               4. Upon receiving a report, the applicable Responsible Campus Official shall promptly notify the applicable campus Provost/Chancellor and the Vice President for Academic Strategy or his or her designee of the incident(s). The Vice President for Academic Strategy or his or her designee will ensure the relevant policies and procedures have been followed.\n  \nIV. Delegation of Authority  The authority to oversee the Covered Programs’ compliance with the requirements and responsibilities set forth in this policy is delegated to the Provost/Chancellors of UH four-year campuses and the Vice President for Community Colleges who will appoint an executive University employee as the Responsible Campus Official for each respective campus.    \nV.

Board of Regents Policy      A. This section establishes the policy for a mechanism for translating the systemwide mission and strategic plan and the unit mission statements into specific programmatic plans guiding the development of each institution and campus. The board’s intent is to provide for detailed planning for each major unit that is consistent with the overall university mission and plan.  \n  \n    B.

    "text": "Board of Regents Policy 7.207\n\nTitle  Clinical & Mental Health Services; & International Student Health    \nHeader  Regents Policy Chapter 7, Student Affairs  \nRegents Policy [RP 7.207](https://www.hawaii.edu/policy?action=viewPolicy&policySection=Rp&policyChapter=7&policyNumber=207), Clinical & Mental Health Services; & International Student Health  \nEffective Date:  January 22, 2015  \nPrior Dates Amended:  Dec. 7, 1972; Oct. 31, 2014 (recodified)  \nReview Date:  August 2018    \nI. Purpose  To set forth a policy regarding provision of clinical and mental health care services for the university and to address student health insurance for international students.    \nII. Definitions  No policy specific or unique definitions apply.    \nIII. Board of Regents Policy  A.    Philosophy & Rationale  \n        1.    The provision of clinical and mental health care services is an educationally legitimate and critical function of any college or university given the dramatic rise in diagnosable physical and mental illness and related behavioral problems.  As a part of their attendance, college students are exposed to illness and to the hazard of injury resulting from the manipulation of various equipment or supplies or through participation in athletic, recreational and co-curricular activities.  Because they may be living away from home or domiciled on or near campus, many college students no longer have access to their customary clinical health services.  Consequently, establishing clinical health services on the campuses of the university can ensure access to medical care for its students by providing convenient treatment of injury and illness.  \n        2.    College attendance creates a unique set of circumstances and stressors that may trigger growth and development in significant ways.  College students often possess physical and emotional needs unique to their age group and environmental context.  It is typically during the college matriculation period that students experience change, need to address personal and identity development issues, work through psychosocial and interpersonal challenges, and deal with growth, development, and more change.  The presence and availability of mental health counseling services on the campuses of the university afford students the opportunity to address psychosocial and psychological concerns in more intentional and healthy ways.  \n        3.    In fostering students' general well-being to succeed academically, the university may also provide a variety of services and programs designed to remove physical and psychological impediments to educational success.  Besides the referral of students to specialized health resources unavailable on campus, clinical and mental health services professionals may need to increase their collaboration in order to address the complexity of problems students present.  As a part of this need to collaborate, the university may compile clinical and mental health records or require a variety of examinations, immunizations, psychological assessments or follow-up tests to assist students in dealing with severity of their presenting concerns.  \n        4.    Thus, in order to encourage students to take responsibility for maintaining their physical and psychological well-being, the university of Hawai‘i establishes policies for clinical and mental health services.  \nB.    Parameters  \n        1.    In providing for the safety, health and well-being of its students, the university, through its administration, shall comply with all applicable requirements of federal, state, and other governmental agencies as may be required by law or by rules and regulations.  \n        2.    The president or the president’s designee shall, by Executive Policy, set forth guidelines to determine the level of care for clinical and mental health services to be provided by the campuses.  \n        3.    Additionally, the president or the president’s designee shall, by Executive Policy, assure university-wide availability of a student health insurance plan(s).  \nC.    All non-immigrants on student visas are required to enroll in a university endorsed student health insurance plan or furnish proof of enrollment in a health insurance program whose benefits meet the minimum insurance requirements set by the president or the president’s designee by Executive Policy.    \nIV. Delegation of Authority  Setting the minimum insurance requirements is delegated to the president or the president’s designee. See RP 7.207(C).    \nV.

Purpose To set forth policy regarding fund raising.\nII. Definitions No policy specific or unique definitions apply.\nIII. Board of Regents Policy A. Fund raising campaigns conducted for the benefit of, and in the name of, the university, or any of its affiliate units, for whatever purpose, must be given prior approval in writing by the president. When board policy appears to be involved, or should the campaign require university funds or have a goal in excess of $50 million, the matter will be taken to the board for approval.\n\nB. The president may process applications from faculty members to local foundations for funds for various purposes if, in the opinion of the administration, the applications are worthy of support from foundations, with the understanding that these applications are not to take the place of the ones submitted by the administration.\n\nC. The University of Hawai‘i Foundation (“Foundation”) is a not-for-profit corporation established to raise funds for the university. The president is authorized to serve on the Board of Trustees of the foundation if requested to do so by the foundation.\n\nD. The board wishes to acknowledge the service of volunteer groups and nonprofit organizations and to encourage their support on behalf of the university. These entities provide valuable assistance in fundraising, public outreach, and other support for the university’s mission. The most common forms of such organizations are support groups and alumni chapters.\n\nAt the same time, as a public trust and the beneficiary of the funds raised, the university is obligated to require that the funds raised by such entities be adequately controlled and properly expended. The president shall promulgate such necessary policies and procedures that provide for the official recognition of groups and includes provisions that promote the fulfillment of the envisioned support of the university by the group and compliance with usual and common business and regulatory practices.\nIV. Delegation of Authority The president may process applications from faculty members to local foundations for funds for various purposes. See RP 8.210(B).\n\nThe president shall promulgate such necessary policies and procedures that provide for the official recognition of certain groups. See RP 8.201.\nV.
