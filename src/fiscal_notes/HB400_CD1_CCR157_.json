  "overview": "The final version of the bill, as amended by the conference committee, finalizes the Judiciary's budget for the 2025-2027 biennium. It restores certain operating funds that were removed in the previous version and changes the effective date from a placeholder to July 1, 2025. This makes the appropriations effective for the upcoming fiscal year.",
  "appropriations": "The conference committee increased the general fund operating budget compared to the previous version, appropriating $201,725,676 for fiscal year 2026 and $199,579,345 for fiscal year 2027. This represents an increase of approximately $2.9 million in the first year and $723,000 in the second year. Notably, this restores the $1.75 million annual appropriation for civil and immigration legal services that was described as removed in the prior fiscal note.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The financial projections were revised by the conference committee to reflect a compromise between the House and Senate versions of the budget. The methodology now incorporates the restoration of funding for specific programs, such as legal services. This indicates a revised assumption that these services are a priority for state funding.",
  "agency_impact": "The restoration of nearly $3 million in general funds for fiscal year 2026 will partially mitigate the severe operational impacts anticipated in the previous fiscal note. Reinstating the $1.75 million for legal services allows the Judiciary to proceed with contracting these services as planned. However, other operational requests for new positions and program expansions may remain unfunded, continuing some of the previously identified staffing and caseload challenges.",
  "economic_impact": "The restoration of the $1.75 million appropriation for civil and immigration legal services will have a positive economic impact on low-income individuals and families. These services help clients achieve housing and employment stability, which were at risk under the previous version of the bill. This funding is expected to generate economic benefits for the community by preventing homelessness and supporting work authorizations.",
  "policy_impact": "This final version reverses the policy shift described in the previous fiscal note. By restoring funding for external legal aid organizations, the measure reaffirms the legislature's policy of supporting access to justice for vulnerable populations through the Judiciary's budget. The billâ€™s final passage with an effective date of July 1, 2025, solidifies this as state policy for the biennium.",
  "revenue_sources": "",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The six-year outlook is significantly altered by the reinstatement of recurring costs for legal services. An annual expenditure of $1.75 million for civil and immigration legal services is now included in the Judiciary's baseline budget for future fiscal years. While this restores a key program, the lack of funding for other requested permanent positions means that pressures related to caseload growth and staffing shortages in the courts will likely persist and continue to appear in future budget requests. The capital improvement budget remains a one-time appropriation with no direct recurring costs, but the projects will incur future operational and maintenance expenses not accounted for in this budget. The overall general fund baseline for the Judiciary is now higher than anticipated in the previous version of the bill.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The ongoing fiscal obligations now include a sustained, annual $1.75 million general fund appropriation for legal services. This establishes a higher baseline for the Judiciary's budget moving forward. Long-term fiscal pressures from unfunded judicial and staff positions remain a concern and will likely require future legislative action.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The final conference draft increases the Judiciary's operating budget, reversing cuts described in the previous fiscal note. General fund appropriations are increased by approximately $2.94 million in fiscal year 2026 and $723,000 in fiscal year 2027. Most notably, this restores the $1.75 million annual appropriation for civil and immigration legal services. The bill's effective date was changed from July 1, 2050, to July 1, 2025, thereby enacting the appropriations, while the capital improvement budget of $12.9 million remains unchanged."
