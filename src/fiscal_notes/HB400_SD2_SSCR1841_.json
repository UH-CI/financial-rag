  "overview": "House Bill 400, Senate Draft 2, reflects amendments by the Senate Committee on Ways and Means. This version significantly alters the bill's appropriations by reducing the operating budget and increasing the capital improvement project (CIP) budget compared to the prior draft. Notably, the funding added in SD1 for civil and immigration legal services has been removed, and the effective date has been changed to facilitate further discussion.",
  "appropriations": "The Ways and Means Committee amended the operating budget to $198,782,736 in general funds for FY 2026 and $198,855,327 for FY 2027, a reduction of approximately $4.5 million from the introduced version and removing the $1.75 million for legal services added in SD1. The CIP appropriation in general obligation bond funds for FY 2026 was increased by $1,000,000, from $11.9 million to a new total of $12,900,000. This measure does not fund the Judiciary's operational requests for new positions or program expansions.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The revised appropriations are based on the fiscal priorities of the Committee on Ways and Means. The reduction in the operating budget indicates a decision not to fund new programs, staff expansions, or the continuation of certain pilot projects at this time. The increase in the CIP budget likely reflects a reprioritization of infrastructure needs or updated cost estimates for statewide projects.",
  "agency_impact": "The reduction in the operating budget will have a significant operational impact on the Judiciary, as it leaves numerous requests for critical staffing and program funding unaddressed. This includes the requested second district court judge in Kona, staff for the new WahiawƒÅ courthouse, and permanent positions for specialty courts like the Women's Court. Consequently, the Judiciary will face continued challenges in managing high caseloads and may experience delays in court services.",
  "economic_impact": "The removal of the $1.75 million appropriation for civil and immigration legal services eliminates the previously anticipated positive economic impacts for low-income residents, such as assistance with housing stability and work authorizations. Failure to fund requested judicial and staff positions may lead to continued court congestion and delays. This could create personal and financial hardships for litigants and businesses awaiting case resolution.",
  "policy_impact": "This measure reverses the policy direction established in SD1, which had created a state-level commitment to funding external legal aid organizations through the Judiciary's budget. The policy focus now returns to funding only the Judiciary's core internal operations and infrastructure. The decision not to fund requested expansions suggests a broader legislative strategy of fiscal constraint for the Judiciary's operational growth.",
  "revenue_sources": "",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The six-year fiscal outlook is altered by the removal of the recurring $1.75 million cost for legal services. However, it introduces a different long-term pressure: the Judiciary's unfunded operational needs are likely to persist and grow, leading to recurring budget requests in future fiscal years to address staffing shortages and program needs. Without this funding, pilot programs like the Women's Court face an uncertain future beyond the expiration of their initial funding, and caseload pressures in areas like Kona are expected to worsen. The CIP budget increase to $12.9 million represents a one-time bond-funded expenditure in FY 2026.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "This measure increases the authorized capital expenditures for the Judiciary in FY 2026. The appropriation for capital improvement projects is set at $12,900,000 in general obligation bond funds. This is an increase of $1,000,000 over the previous draft to address emerging building issues statewide.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The long-term fiscal implications now center on managing the consequences of an underfunded operating budget. The Judiciary will likely face ongoing challenges in meeting public service demands with existing resources. This creates a sustained pressure for future legislatures to address the growing gap between judicial workloads and staffing levels.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The primary update is the amendment by the Senate Ways and Means Committee, creating the SD2 version. The operating budget was significantly reduced, removing the $1,750,000 for civil and immigration legal services that was added in SD1; the new general fund totals are now approximately $4.5 million lower than in the introduced version. Conversely, the Capital Improvement Project appropriation for FY 2026 was increased by $1,000,000 to $12,900,000. The Judiciary's internal operating requests for new positions and specialty courts remain unfunded, and the bill's effective date was changed to July 1, 2050."
