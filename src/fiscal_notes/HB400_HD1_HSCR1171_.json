  "overview": "House Bill 400, House Draft 1, has been amended by the House Committee on Finance to increase the Capital Improvement Project (CIP) appropriation to $11.9 million in General Obligation Bond funds for FY 2026. This change formalizes a previously recommended increase to address funding needs for the relocation of the Children's Justice Center on O'ahu. Operating budget appropriations remain unchanged from the introduced version, despite detailed testimony requesting funds for specific programs like specialty courts, cybersecurity, and staffing for the new Wahiawā courthouse.",
  "appropriations": "The House Committee on Finance has amended the measure, increasing the Capital Improvement Project appropriation for FY 2026 from $9,900,000 to $11,900,000 in General Obligation Bond funds. This increase of $2,000,000 is intended for the Judiciary's lump sum CIP budget to cover costs for the relocation of the Children's Justice Center on O'ahu. Operating appropriations for FY 2026 ($203,319,009 General Funds) and FY 2027 ($203,391,600 General Funds) were not amended.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "",
  "agency_impact": "The Judiciary's testimony details significant operational impacts tied to its operating budget request, which has not yet been amended. Key impacts include establishing a permanent Women's Court (8.0 FTEs), fully staffing the new Wahiawā District Court (11.0 FTEs and security contracts), and adding a new District Court Judge and support staff in Kona (4.0 FTEs). The funding is also intended to enhance cybersecurity capabilities and make other pilot programs permanent, directly affecting court capacity, public safety, and access to justice.",
  "economic_impact": "",
  "policy_impact": "The Judiciary's requests, as detailed in testimony, aim to make several pilot programs permanent, thereby solidifying policy shifts towards rehabilitative justice. Establishing the Women’s Court and DWI Court as permanent programs moves them from temporary initiatives to core components of the state's strategy for addressing trauma, substance abuse, and recidivism. Expanding the Truancy Court further integrates the Judiciary with the Department of Education to provide early intervention for at-risk youth.",
  "revenue_sources": "",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The Judiciary's testimony outlines significant recurring costs that extend beyond the initial biennium, forming the basis of a multi-year fiscal outlook. Key annual recurring expenses include approximately $705,416 for the permanent Women's Court, $237,612 for the permanent DWI Court Program, and $360,048 for the new Kona District Court Judge and staff. The new Wahiawā District Court will require over $1 million annually for staffing and security contracts, including $192,408 for adult client services, $54,168 for a janitor, $486,967 for security, $52,908 for IT, and $317,448 for clerks and bailiffs. Additionally, the cybersecurity email upgrade represents a major recurring cost of $1,175,300 annually. Other requests, such as continuing the Criminal Justice Research Institute and restoring numerous defunded positions, also establish permanent, ongoing salary and operational costs. These figures do not account for future collective bargaining increases. The Capital Improvement Project funding of $11.9 million is a one-time expenditure, though new facilities will incur future operational and maintenance costs.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The House Committee on Finance has amended the bill to increase the total Capital Improvement Project appropriation to $11.9 million in General Obligation Bond funds for FY 2026. This reflects a $2 million increase over the introduced amount, specifically added to the lump sum bond fund request. This additional funding is intended to address a projected cost overrun for the relocation of the Children’s Justice Center on O‘ahu, bringing the total lump sum request to $7 million.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The establishment of permanent programs and staffing, such as the Women's Court, DWI Court, the new Wahiawā courthouse operations, and the additional Kona judgeship, creates ongoing fiscal obligations. These programs and positions will require sustained funding for salaries, benefits, and operational expenses beyond the six-year horizon. The continuation of these services will be dependent on recurring general fund appropriations.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The primary update is the formalization of the Capital Improvement Project (CIP) budget increase by the House Committee on Finance, which amended the bill to appropriate $11.9 million in GO Bonds, a $2 million increase from the introduced version. This moves beyond the prior note's mention of a 'recommendation' and confirms the funding for the Children's Justice Center relocation. In contrast, the operating budget appropriations remain unchanged, meaning the detailed funding requests for new positions, specialty courts, and the external request for $1 million for civil legal services have not been incorporated at this stage. This fiscal note also adds specific details from Judiciary testimony regarding long-term costs and the operational and policy impacts of its requests, which were not present in the previous note."
