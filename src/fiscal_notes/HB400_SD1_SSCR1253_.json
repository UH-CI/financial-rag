  "overview": "House Bill 400, House Draft 1 has been amended by the Senate Committee on Judiciary, creating Senate Draft 1. This new version increases the operating budget for Administration (JUD601) by $1,750,000. The additional funds are designated to support civil legal services and legal services for individuals in immigration-related court proceedings, responding to testimony from community legal aid organizations.",
  "appropriations": "The Senate Committee on Judiciary amended the measure to increase the appropriation for Administration (JUD601) by $1,750,000. This increase is intended to provide $1,000,000 for civil legal services and $750,000 for legal services for individuals in immigration-related court proceedings. The Capital Improvement Project appropriation of $11.9 million in General Obligation Bond funds for FY 2026 remains unchanged from the previous version.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The addition of $1,750,000 in operating funds is based on testimony from community organizations like Volunteer Legal Services Hawai‘i and The Legal Clinic. These organizations documented unmet needs for civil and immigration-related legal aid in the community. The amounts directly reflect the specific funding increases requested by these providers to address service gaps and the potential impacts of federal policy changes.",
  "agency_impact": "The Judiciary's Administration (JUD601) will be tasked with expending the newly appropriated $1,750,000 for civil and immigration legal services. This creates a new administrative responsibility to manage contracts or grants with external legal service providers. The operational impacts related to the Judiciary's internal requests for staffing and programs, such as for the Wahiawā court and Kona judgeship, are not addressed by this amendment, as those items remain unfunded.",
  "economic_impact": "The appropriation for civil and immigration legal services is expected to yield positive economic impacts for the community. By funding legal assistance, the measure can help prevent evictions and homelessness, maintain family unity, and assist individuals in obtaining work authorizations. These outcomes contribute to community and economic stability for low-income residents.",
  "policy_impact": "This measure, as amended, signals a new policy direction by dedicating state funds to mitigate the local impacts of federal immigration policies and to address the broader justice gap for low-income residents. By funding legal services for civil and immigration cases through the Judiciary's budget, the Legislature is establishing a state-level commitment to ensuring access to justice. This moves beyond funding the Judiciary's internal operations to also supporting external legal aid infrastructure.",
  "revenue_sources": "",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The amendment introduces a new recurring cost of $1,750,000 per fiscal year for civil and immigration legal services. This establishes a new baseline for the Judiciary's budget that will likely be requested in subsequent years to maintain these services. This is in addition to the previously identified recurring costs associated with the Judiciary's internal operational requests, which remain unfunded in this version of the bill.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The establishment of state funding for civil and immigration legal services creates an ongoing fiscal obligation. To sustain the program and continue addressing community needs, this $1,750,000 annual appropriation will likely need to be continued beyond the six-year fiscal planning horizon. The long-term sustainability will depend on future general fund appropriations.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The primary update is the Senate Judiciary Committee's amendment creating the SD1 version of the bill, which increases the operating budget. The previous fiscal note stated that the operating budget was unchanged from the introduced version; this version adds $1,750,000 to the Administration (JUD601) appropriation to fund civil legal services ($1,000,000) and immigration-related legal services ($750,000). While the Capital Improvement Project appropriation remains unchanged at $11.9 million, the Judiciary's internal operating requests for new positions and specialty courts still have not been incorporated into the bill's appropriations."
