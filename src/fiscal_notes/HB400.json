{
  "overview": "House Bill 400, House Draft 1, appropriates operating and capital improvement funds for the Judiciary for the 2025–2027 fiscal biennium. The measure funds the expansion and permanence of specialty courts, staffing for the new Wahiawā District Court, and a new judgeship in Kona. It also addresses critical cybersecurity upgrades, continues the Criminal Justice Research Institute, and restores essential positions defunded during the pandemic.",
  "appropriations": "The bill appropriates additional operating funds of $6.17 million for 18.0 FTEs in FY 2026 and $6.25 million in FY 2027. It also requests $11.9 million in bond funds for Capital Improvement Projects (CIP) in FY 2026. These funds are intended for staffing specialty courts, the new Wahiawā courthouse, a new Kona judgeship, cybersecurity upgrades, contractual services, and restoring various positions across the circuits.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "Projections are based on projected resource needs to address increased caseloads, staff new facilities, and make successful pilot programs permanent. Cost calculations for personnel are based on established salary schedules for the 18.0 requested FTEs. Technology costs are based on vendor pricing for specific upgrades like Microsoft M365 G5 email subscriptions and network switch replacements, while CIP costs are based on design and construction estimates.",
  "agency_impact": "The measure will significantly enhance the Judiciary's operational capacity by making the Women’s Court and DWI Court permanent, fully staffing the new Wahiawā District Court, and adding a judge to alleviate unsustainable caseloads in Kona. Restoring 19 positions defunded during the pandemic will address critical staffing shortages in court clerk, IT support, and social worker roles, improving efficiency and public service. The funding also strengthens the Judiciary's cybersecurity posture and supports data-driven policy through the Criminal Justice Research Institute.",
  "economic_impact": "The bill is expected to generate positive economic effects by providing alternatives to incarceration through the Women's Court, potentially reducing long-term correctional costs. Funding for programs like the DWI Court aims to reduce recidivism and improve public safety, while the Truancy Court collaboration represents an early intervention strategy to improve educational outcomes. Efficiently functioning courts in Kona and Wahiawā will reduce costly delays for individuals and businesses interacting with the justice system.",
  "policy_impact": "This measure solidifies several key policy initiatives by transitioning pilot projects, such as the Women’s Court, from temporary status to permanent programs within the state's justice system. It advances the policy of improving access to justice in growing and rural communities by funding new facilities and staff in Wahiawā, Kona, and South Kohala. Furthermore, continued funding for the Criminal Justice Research Institute reinforces the state's commitment to using centralized data for evidence-based policymaking in the criminal justice field.",
  "revenue_sources": "The operating budget requests are to be funded by general fund appropriations from the state. The Capital Improvement Project requests, totaling $11.9 million for FY 2026, are to be financed through the issuance of general obligation bonds. The provided testimony does not identify any new fees, grants, or other dedicated revenue streams to support these specific budget requests.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The bill requests additional operating funds of $6.17 million in FY 2026 and $6.25 million in FY 2027. Most of these costs are recurring, primarily for the 17.0 permanent FTE positions and technology subscriptions. These personnel costs for the Women's Court ($705k annually), Wahiawā Court staffing (over $900k annually), Kona Judge and staff (over $360k annually), and other restored positions will continue beyond the biennium and are expected to increase with salary adjustments. The cybersecurity email upgrade ($1.175 million annually) and cybersecurity staff/tools ($458k annually) are also recurring operational expenses. The network switch replacement ($560k in FY26, $420k in FY27) is a short-term project, but similar replacement costs will arise again in 5-8 years. The capital request of $11.9 million in FY 2026 is a one-time bond-funded expenditure for specific projects. However, the completion of the South Kohala Courthouse will result in new, ongoing operational and maintenance costs in subsequent years that are not yet quantified in this request. The overall fiscal impact will be a permanent increase to the Judiciary's base operating budget of over $6 million annually, which is expected to persist and grow in the four years following the initial biennium.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The proposed measure is not expected to have a direct impact on the Judiciary's operating revenues. The bill appropriates funds for expenditures and does not introduce new fees, fines, or other revenue-generating mechanisms. Therefore, no significant change in operating revenue is anticipated as a result of this bill.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The bill includes a significant capital expenditure request of $11.9 million in bond funds for FY 2026. Key projects include $4.0 million for the design of a new South Kohala District Courthouse to address safety and capacity issues. Additionally, it requests $900,000 to replace an A/C chiller at Pu‘uhonua Kaulike on Kaua‘i and a $7.0 million lump sum for statewide projects, including a $2.0 million allocation for the relocation of the Children’s Justice Center on O‘ahu.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The fiscal implications beyond the six-year period will be substantial and ongoing, as the bill establishes 17.0 permanent positions and makes several programs permanent. The annual operating costs of over $6 million for salaries, benefits, and technology subscriptions will become part of the Judiciary's base budget indefinitely. Additionally, new facilities like the Wahiawā and future South Kohala courthouses will require perpetual funding for maintenance, utilities, and lifecycle replacements.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "No previous fiscal note was provided in the context documents for comparison."
