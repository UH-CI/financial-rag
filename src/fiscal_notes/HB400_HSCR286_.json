  "overview": "House Bill 400 appropriates operating and capital improvement funds for the Judiciary for the 2025â€“2027 fiscal biennium to support specialty courts, staffing, and technology upgrades. Testimony received supported the measure and included a significant request from legal aid organizations for an additional $1,000,000 in funding for statewide civil legal services. The House Committee on Judiciary & Hawaiian Affairs recommended an increase to the capital improvement budget to support the relocation of the Children's Justice Center.",
  "appropriations": "While the Judiciary's testimony requests $9.9 million in bond funds for Capital Improvement Projects (CIP) in FY 2026, the House Committee on Judiciary & Hawaiian Affairs has recommended considering an increase to a total of $11.9 million. This increase consists of an additional $2 million in lump sum funds to cover the relocation of the Children's Justice Center. Additionally, testimony from legal aid organizations urged the legislature to add $1,000,000 to the line item for statewide civil legal services.",

  "economic_impact": "In addition to the impacts from the Judiciary's programs, testimony suggests that increasing funding for civil legal services by $1,000,000 would yield positive economic benefits. These services help prevent costly outcomes like eviction, homelessness, and family separation. This funding acts as a critical component of the social safety net, potentially reducing state expenditures in other areas.",
  "policy_impact": "Beyond the Judiciary's direct initiatives, the proposal to increase funding for civil legal services by $1,000,000 reflects a broader policy goal of enhancing access to justice for indigent residents. This funding supports the state's safety net for vulnerable populations facing critical civil legal issues. This aligns with the Judiciary's role in administering access to justice programs.",

  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The Judiciary's initial CIP request was $9.9 million for FY 2026, including a $5 million lump sum for statewide projects. However, the House Committee on Judiciary & Hawaiian Affairs recommended that the Committee on Finance consider increasing the lump sum portion to $7 million. This change is to specifically account for an additional $2 million needed for the relocation of the Children's Justice Center, raising the potential total CIP funding to $11.9 million.",

  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The primary updates involve Capital Improvement Project (CIP) funding and a new request for civil legal services. The CIP appropriation has been clarified: the Judiciary initially requested $9.9 million, but a committee recommendation may increase this to $11.9 million by adding $2 million to the lump sum specifically for the Children's Justice Center relocation. Secondly, strong testimony from multiple legal aid organizations introduced a new request for an additional $1,000,000 to be appropriated for the statewide civil legal services line-item, a point not reflected in the previous note."
