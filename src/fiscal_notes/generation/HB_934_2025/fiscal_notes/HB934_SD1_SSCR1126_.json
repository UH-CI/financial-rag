  "overview": "This measure transfers the Hawaii Broadband and Digital Equity Office from the Department of Business, Economic Development, and Tourism to the Office of Enterprise Technology Services in the Department of Accounting and General Services. As amended, the bill renames the office to the \"Broadband Office,\" changes the proposed \"Broadband and Digital Equity Special Fund\" to the \"Broadband Revolving Fund,\" and repeals the Broadband Assistance Advisory Council. The bill appropriates funds for the new revolving fund and for the reimbursement of contracts.",
  "appropriations": "The legislative document appropriates out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $200,000 (HB934_SD1_.HTM.txt) for fiscal year 2025-2026 to be deposited into the broadband revolving fund. A second appropriation out of the broadband revolving fund for $200,000 (HB934_SD1_.HTM.txt) is made for fiscal year 2025-2026 for the reimbursement of contracts executed by the broadband office. The bill also inserts a blank appropriation amount to establish a blank number of digital navigator positions.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The appropriation is based on testimony from the Lieutenant Governor which proposes a \"one-time appropriation of $200,000 (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_EDT_03-11-25_.PDF.txt) into the newly created broadband revolving fund.\" The methodology is for this appropriation to serve as seed money for a revolving fund, enabling \"timely reimbursement to non-profit organizations while the Broadband Office draws down on federal funding.\" A key assumption is that \"The intent is to return the full amount back to the General Fund in 5 years (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_EDT_03-11-25_.PDF.txt).\"",
  "agency_impact": "The Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs (DCCA) supports the bill and requests amendments to consolidate the stateâ€™s broadband functions into the HBDEO through the repeal of HRS Section 440G-11.5 and Act 199. DCCA states that consolidating duties under one state agency would \"conserve taxpayer resources\" and \"reduce confusion by having one state office in which the public can be referred to.\" The Office of Enterprise Technology Services notes that the HBDEO had previously requested $777,090 (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_EDT_03-11-25_.PDF.txt) for FY 26 and asks that this funding be included in the bill.",
  "economic_impact": "Testimony from Hawaiian Telcom states the state's share of BEAD funding is $149.5M plus $46M in state matching funds to increase broadband infrastructure. Charter Communications states that in 2023, it invested $96 (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_EDT_03-11-25_.PDF.txt) million across the state. Testimony from the Lieutenant Governor states that federal and state governments have committed over $400 (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_EDT_03-11-25_.PDF.txt) million to modernize infrastructure.",
  "policy_impact": "This measure has been amended to enact significant policy consolidation as suggested in testimony. The bill now repeals the broadband duties assigned to the Director of the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs and disbands the Hawaii Broadband Assistance Advisory Council. The committee report notes concerns from stakeholders \"regarding the exclusion of broadband infrastructure for retail services under the State's digital equity goals\" but retains the restrictive language in the bill.",
  "revenue_sources": "The bill codifies revenue sources for the new broadband revolving fund that were previously only suggested in testimony. The legislative document specifies the fund shall be deposited with the \"(1) Proceeds of leases of broadband infrastructure owned by the State; (2) Appropriations by the legislature to the revolving fund; and (3) Gifts, donations, and grants from public agencies and private persons (HB934_SD1_.HTM.txt).\" Testimony from the Lieutenant Governor anticipates the state will generate \"revenue from negotiated lease agreements (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_EDT_03-11-25_.PDF.txt)\" from new subsea broadband infrastructure.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The legislative document appropriates $200,000 (HB934_SD1_.HTM.txt) from general revenues into the new broadband revolving fund for FY 2025-2026. From that fund, $200,000 (HB934_SD1_.HTM.txt) is appropriated in the same fiscal year for contract reimbursements. According to testimony from the Lieutenant Governor, the intent is for this to be a one-time infusion, as the state intends \"to return the full amount back to the General Fund in 5 years (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_EDT_03-11-25_.PDF.txt).\" This differs from the needs expressed by the Office of Enterprise Technology Services (ETS). ETS testimony states the HBDEO had requested \"$777,090 (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_EDT_03-11-25_.PDF.txt) for FY 26 with $452,302 (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_EDT_03-11-25_.PDF.txt) for personal services, and $324,788 (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_EDT_03-11-25_.PDF.txt) for other expenses.\" ETS believes these figures provide for a sound budget and requests the funding be included. The bill also contains a blank appropriation for an unspecified number of digital navigator positions, which could represent future recurring costs.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The bill formalizes a positive impact on operating revenue by establishing the broadband revolving fund. The legislative document states this fund shall receive the \"Proceeds of leases of broadband infrastructure owned by the State (HB934_SD1_.HTM.txt).\" Testimony from the Lieutenant Governor anticipates that \"with the construction of new subsea broadband infrastructure, our state anticipates generating revenue from negotiated lease agreements (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_EDT_03-11-25_.PDF.txt).\"",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The long-term fiscal implications have been clarified by testimony indicating the initial general fund appropriation is intended as a loan to the revolving fund. Testimony from the Lieutenant Governor states, \"The intent is to return the full amount back to the General Fund in 5 years (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_EDT_03-11-25_.PDF.txt).\" Therefore, after the initial period, the ongoing fiscal obligations for the office's projects will depend on the revolving fund's ability to be self-sustaining through lease proceeds, grants, and other non-general fund sources.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The appropriation is no longer unspecified; the bill now appropriates a specific $200,000 (HB934_SD1_.HTM.txt) for FY 2025-2026, intended as a loan to be repaid in 5 years. The proposed special fund has been changed to a \"Broadband Revolving Fund,\" and significant policy changes now consolidate state broadband duties by repealing the Broadband Assistance Advisory Council and transferring functions from the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs. The committee report now formally acknowledges stakeholder concerns regarding the \"retail service\" restriction, and the bill codifies revenue streams from infrastructure leases into the new revolving fund."
