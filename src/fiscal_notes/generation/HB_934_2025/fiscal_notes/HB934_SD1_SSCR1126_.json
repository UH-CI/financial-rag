  "overview": "This measure transfers the Hawaii Broadband and Digital Equity Office from the Department of Business, Economic Development, and Tourism to the Office of Enterprise Technology Services.

[9] [9] [9] It also repeals broadband duties assigned to the Director of Commerce and Consumer Affairs. [8]",
  "appropriations": "The legislative document specifies an appropriation of $200,000 (HB934_SD1_.HTM.txt) out of the general revenues for fiscal year 2025-2026 to be deposited into the broadband revolving fund. [8] The bill also appropriates $200,000 (HB934_SD1_.HTM.txt) from the broadband revolving fund for the reimbursement of contracts executed by the broadband office. [8] An additional blank appropriation is included for the establishment of an unspecified number of full-time equivalent digital navigator positions. [8]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "Testimony proposes a one-time appropriation of $200,000 (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_EDT_03-11-25_.PDF.txt) for the reimbursement of contracts to enable timely reimbursement to non-profit organizations while the Broadband Office draws down on federal funding.

  "economic_impact": "The federal and state governments have committed over $400 million (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_EDT_03-11-25_.PDF.txt) to modernize subsea and terrestrial infrastructure. [7] Hawaii is slated to receive over $200 million in federal grants for broadband infrastructure in the immediate future via the Broadband, Equity, Access, and Deployment Program.

  "policy_impact": "The S.D. 1 version of the bill repeals Chapter 206S, Hawaii Revised Statutes, and section 440G-11.5, Hawaii Revised Statutes.

[7] [7] ETS states the HBDEO had asked for $777,090 (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_EDT_03-11-25_.PDF.txt) for FY 26, consisting of $452,302 (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_EDT_03-11-25_.PDF.txt) for personal services and $324,788 (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_EDT_03-11-25_.PDF.txt) for other expenses.

  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The Broadband and Digital Equity Special Fund is intended to prioritize funding for projects related to broadband adoption and affordability programs, rather than retail infrastructure projects. [7] [7] Testimony was received expressing concern with language excluding the deployment of broadband infrastructure for the provision of retail service, stating the term is undefined and could restrict community-led initiatives. [7] [7] [7] Other testimony notes the intent of the amendment was to ensure that new competition enters the market on a fair and equal playing field. [7]",
