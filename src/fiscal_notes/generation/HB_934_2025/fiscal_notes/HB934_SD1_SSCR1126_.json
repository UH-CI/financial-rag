{
  "overview": "The proposed measure has been amended to implement several structural changes, including renaming the Hawai ªi Broadband and Digital Equity Office to the Broadband Office and changing the special fund to a revolving fund (HB934_SD1). It also now repeals broadband-related duties previously assigned to the Director of the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs (HB934_SD1_SSCR1126_). Additionally, the measure disbands the Hawaii Broadband Assistance Advisory Council to centralize statewide broadband responsibilities (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_EDT_03-11-25_).",
  "appropriations": "The bill now appropriates a specific sum of $200,000 (HB934_SD1) from general revenues for fiscal year 2025-2026 to be deposited into the new Broadband Revolving Fund. It then appropriates $200,000 (HB934_SD1) from that revolving fund for the reimbursement of contracts executed by the Broadband Office. A new, unfunded provision has been added to appropriate a blank amount for an unspecified number of full-time equivalent digital navigator positions (HB934_SD1).",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The new appropriation of $200,000 (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_EDT_03-11-25_) is based on a request from the Lieutenant Governor's office. This one-time appropriation is intended to serve as a reimbursement mechanism for contracts with non-profit organizations while the office awaits federal funding drawdowns. Testimony indicates the intent is to return the full amount to the General Fund in five years (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_EDT_03-11-25_).",
  "agency_impact": "This measure now consolidates state broadband functions, which will have a direct impact on the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs (DCCA) by repealing its broadband-related duties (HB934_SD1). Testimony from the DCCA indicates this transfer of duties will not negatively impact public services. It is expected to reduce public confusion by creating a single point of contact for broadband matters (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_EDT_03-11-25_).",
  "economic_impact": "New testimony indicates the state and federal governments have committed over $400 million (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_EDT_03-11-25_) to modernize Hawaii's broadband infrastructure. Additional private investment data shows that Charter Communications invested $96 million (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_EDT_03-11-25_) across the state in 2023, extending its network to 9,000 additional homes and businesses. Through federal affordability programs, the company helped connect over 59,000 (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_EDT_03-11-25_) eligible households in Hawaii.",
  "policy_impact": "The measure now enacts significant policy consolidation by repealing the statutory duties of the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs related to broadband services and disbanding the Broadband Assistance Advisory Council (HB934_SD1). This centralizes the state's broadband policy and planning within the newly renamed Broadband Office under the Office of Enterprise Technology Services. The bill also changes the funding mechanism from a special fund to a revolving fund to manage anticipated revenues from infrastructure leases (HB934_SD1_SSCR1126_).",
  "revenue_sources": "The bill now specifies a general fund appropriation of $200,000 (HB934_SD1) for fiscal year 2025-2026. Testimony clarifies this is a one-time infusion that is intended to be repaid to the General Fund within five years (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_EDT_03-11-25_). The newly established Broadband Revolving Fund is designed to be sustained by revenues from sources including the proceeds of leases of state-owned broadband infrastructure (HB934_SD1).",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The bill now includes a specific appropriation of $200,000 (HB934_SD1) for FY26 for contract reimbursements, which is intended as a one-time infusion to be repaid within five years (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_EDT_03-11-25_). However, testimony from the Office of Enterprise Technology Services (ETS) maintains a request for a substantially larger operating budget of $777,090 (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_EDT_03-11-25_) for FY26 to adequately manage the office. This creates a significant funding gap between the agency's stated needs and the current appropriation for the initial years of operation. Furthermore, the measure introduces a new unfunded requirement to establish an unspecified number of digital navigator positions, which will add to future personnel costs without a specified funding source (HB934_SD1). The revolving fund is intended to generate revenue from infrastructure leases to cover future costs, but the timeline and amount of this revenue are not yet determined. The current budget for the existing office is $360,000 (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_EDT_03-11-25_) for four staff members. The ETS request of $777,090 (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_EDT_03-11-25_) includes $452,302 (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_EDT_03-11-25_) for personal services and $324,788 (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_EDT_03-11-25_) for other expenses. Without further appropriations, the office will be significantly underfunded compared to its requested operational budget.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The measure now establishes the Broadband Revolving Fund, which is authorized to collect revenue from the 'Proceeds of leases of broadband infrastructure owned by the State' (HB934_SD1). Testimony from the Lieutenant Governor's office anticipates that the state's investment in new subsea broadband infrastructure will generate revenue from these negotiated lease agreements (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_EDT_03-11-25_). This creates a new potential stream of operating revenue for the State, which will be deposited into the revolving fund to support broadband initiatives.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The long-term fiscal plan is now clearer with the establishment of a revolving fund designed to be self-sustaining through revenues generated from leases of state-owned broadband assets (HB934_SD1). Testimony from the Lieutenant Governor's office confirms the intent to repay the initial $200,000 (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_EDT_03-11-25_) general fund appropriation within five years, indicating a shift toward reliance on the revolving fund. Ongoing costs will include defraying internet service costs and funding technical assistance positions, supported by these anticipated revenues (HB934_SD1).",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "This fiscal note is updated based on amendments that make significant structural changes, including renaming the office to the 'Broadband Office', changing the funding mechanism to a revolving fund, and consolidating state authority by repealing the broadband duties of the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs and disbanding the Broadband Assistance Advisory Council (HB934_SD1_SSCR1126_). A specific appropriation of $200,000 (HB934_SD1) for FY26 contract reimbursements replaces the previous unspecified amount, and its purpose as a temporary, repayable fund is now defined (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_EDT_03-11-25_). The bill now adds a blank appropriation for new digital navigator positions (HB934_SD1). New economic data includes an aggregated government investment figure of over $400 million (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_EDT_03-11-25_) and specific private investment of $96 million (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_EDT_03-11-25_) from Charter Communications."
