  "overview": "This measure renames the Hawaii Broadband and Digital Equity Office to the Broadband Office and transfers it to the Department of Accounting and General Services (DAGS), rather than the Office of Enterprise Technology Services as previously proposed (HB934_CD1). It establishes the Broadband Revolving Fund and appropriates funds for six full-time equivalent Digital Navigator positions (HB934_CD1). The bill also repeals the Broadband Assistance Advisory Council and transfers certain broadband infrastructure notice duties to the new office (HB934_CD1_CCR222_).",
  "appropriations": "The final version of the bill inserts a specific appropriation of $800,000 (HB934_CD1) out of the newly established Broadband Revolving Fund. These funds are designated for fiscal year 2025-2026 to establish and fund six full-time equivalent (1.0 FTE) permanent Digital Navigator positions (HB934_CD1). The purpose of these positions is to provide digital literacy support to the community (HB934_CD1_CCR222_).",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "",
  "agency_impact": "The operational impact has shifted, as the Broadband Office will now be established within the Department of Accounting and General Services (DAGS) and advise the Comptroller, not the Office of Enterprise Technology Services and the Chief Information Officer (HB934_CD1). DAGS will be responsible for the administrative oversight of the office and the management of six new permanent Digital Navigator positions (HB934_CD1). Expenditures from the revolving fund are now subject to prior approval by the Comptroller, adding a new layer of fiscal supervision (HB934_CD1_CCR222_).",
  "economic_impact": "The measure is expected to have a direct positive economic impact on the community through the creation of six Digital Navigator positions (HB934_CD1). These positions are designed to improve digital literacy and help residents access online services, education, and employment opportunities. This investment in digital equity aims to provide long-term economic benefits by increasing the workforce's digital skills and ensuring more residents can participate in the digital economy (HB934_CD1_CCR222_).",
  "policy_impact": "The measure amends state policy by establishing a new governance and oversight structure for broadband-related expenditures. All expenditures from the Broadband Revolving Fund must now be advised by the Information Technology Steering Committee and receive prior approval from the Comptroller (HB934_CD1). This change centralizes fiscal control within the Department of Accounting and General Services, altering the policy framework from previous versions of the bill (HB934_CD1_CCR222_).",
  "revenue_sources": "",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The six-year fiscal outlook is significantly altered by the introduction of a new, recurring personnel cost. The bill appropriates $800,000 (HB934_CD1) for fiscal year 2025-2026 to fund six permanent Digital Navigator positions. This establishes an ongoing annual expenditure that was not present in previous versions of the measure. This recurring cost will be drawn from the Broadband Revolving Fund, placing immediate and continuous pressure on the fund's balance. Given earlier concerns about the fund's ability to be self-sustaining, this new annual personnel expense of $800,000 (HB934_CD1_CCR222_) increases the likelihood that the fund may require supplemental general fund appropriations in the future to remain solvent while also covering other operational or contract costs.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The creation of six permanent, full-time equivalent positions establishes a significant long-term fiscal obligation. The annual cost of these positions, funded at $800,000 (HB934_CD1) for the first year, will continue indefinitely beyond the six-year fiscal planning period. This makes the long-term sustainability of the Broadband Office highly dependent on the revolving fund's ability to generate sufficient recurring revenue to cover these personnel costs in addition to other operational needs (HB934_CD1_CCR222_).",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "This fiscal note is updated to reflect significant changes in the final version of the bill. A new appropriation of $800,000 (HB934_CD1) from the Broadband Revolving Fund has been added to establish six permanent Digital Navigator positions. The Broadband Office will now be housed within the Department of Accounting and General Services (DAGS), not the Office of Enterprise Technology Services, and will advise the Comptroller (HB934_CD1_CCR222_). A new governance structure has been implemented, requiring Comptroller approval for all expenditures from the revolving fund (HB934_CD1)."
