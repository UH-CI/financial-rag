  "overview": "This measure renames the Hawaii Broadband and Digital Equity Office to the Broadband Office and transfers it to the Department of Accounting and General Services, advising the Comptroller. It establishes a Broadband Revolving Fund and appropriates funds from it to create six new Digital Navigator positions. The measure also repeals the Broadband Assistance Advisory Council and certain duties of the Director of Commerce and Consumer Affairs.",
  "appropriations": "The bill now includes a specific appropriation of $800,000 for fiscal year 2025-2026 from the newly established Broadband Revolving Fund. This funding is explicitly designated to establish and support six full-time equivalent (6.0 FTE) permanent Digital Navigator positions. This new appropriation directly addresses the staffing and operational costs of the office.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "Fiscal projections are now based on the explicit appropriation of $800,000 to fund six positions, directly addressing the operational funding needs previously identified as a shortfall. This eliminates the prior assumption of an unfunded mandate, with costs now calculated based on legislatively mandated staffing levels. The analysis assumes this appropriation covers the full first-year personnel costs for the new positions.",
  "agency_impact": "The Department of Accounting and General Services is now tasked with establishing the new Broadband Office and funding six Digital Navigator positions. A new governance structure is implemented, requiring expenditures from the revolving fund to be advised by the Information Technology Steering Committee and receive prior approval from the Comptroller. The office's advisory role is redirected from the Chief Information Officer to the Comptroller, altering internal reporting lines.",
  "economic_impact": "The creation of six state-funded Digital Navigator positions is expected to generate positive economic benefits by increasing digital literacy and broadband adoption in underserved communities. This program aims to improve residents' access to telehealth, remote work opportunities, and online education, potentially reducing long-term social support costs. These positions represent a direct investment in the state's digital equity infrastructure.",
  "policy_impact": "The measure's policy focus shifts significantly toward proactive digital equity initiatives through the establishment and funding of a statewide Digital Navigator program. This codifies a commitment to direct community assistance, moving beyond infrastructure and administrative functions. Furthermore, placing expenditure approval under the Comptroller and requiring advice from the IT Steering Committee integrates broadband spending into the state's central financial and technological oversight framework.",
  "revenue_sources": "The primary funding source for the new operational staff is the Broadband Revolving Fund. An initial appropriation of $800,000 will be made from this fund to support the six Digital Navigator positions. The long-term viability of these positions will depend on the revolving fund's ability to generate sufficient ongoing revenue.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The fiscal outlook now includes a recurring annual cost of approximately $800,000 for six permanent positions, beginning in fiscal year 2026. This appropriation directly addresses the operational funding shortfall noted in the previous analysis. The financial viability of the Broadband Office over the next six years is now contingent on the Broadband Revolving Fund's capacity to generate sufficient revenues to sustain these personnel costs annually. If the fund is unable to cover these expenses, the office will require future general fund appropriations to avoid a reduction in force. The previous concern about an unfunded mandate of over $500,000 has been resolved by this new, specific appropriation, which aligns closely with previously requested operational funding levels.",

  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The long-term fiscal obligation is now clarified as a recurring annual cost of approximately $800,000 to sustain the six Digital Navigator positions. The fiscal stability of this program beyond the six-year horizon is entirely dependent on the performance and revenue generation of the Broadband Revolving Fund. A structural deficit will emerge if the fund's revenues do not consistently meet or exceed this ongoing personnel expenditure.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The most significant change is the insertion of an $800,000 appropriation from the Broadband Revolving Fund to establish and fund six permanent Digital Navigator positions, addressing the previously identified operational funding gap. The administrative placement of the Broadband Office is finalized within the Department of Accounting and General Services, advising the Comptroller, rather than within the Office of Enterprise Technology Services. A new expenditure governance model has been added, requiring advice from the Information Technology Steering Committee and prior approval from the Comptroller for use of the revolving fund."
