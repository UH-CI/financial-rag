  "overview": "This bill transfers the Hawaii Broadband and Digital Equity Office from the Department of Business, Economic Development, and Tourism (DBEDT) to the Office of Enterprise Technology Services within the Department of Accounting and General Services (DAGS). The measure renames the office to the Broadband Office and establishes a new Broadband Revolving Fund to support its activities. It also repeals certain broadband-related duties of the Director of Commerce and Consumer Affairs and dissolves the Broadband Assistance Advisory Council, centralizing the state's broadband strategy.",
  "appropriations": "The bill appropriates $200,000 (HB934) from the state's general revenues for fiscal year 2025-2026 to be deposited into the newly created Broadband Revolving Fund. It then appropriates $200,000 (HB934) from that revolving fund for the same fiscal year to be used for the reimbursement of contracts executed by the Broadband Office. An unspecified amount is also appropriated from the revolving fund for an unspecified number of full-time equivalent digital navigator positions.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal projections are based directly on the appropriation amounts specified in the legislative text for fiscal year 2025-2026. The document does not provide the underlying methodology, data sources, or assumptions used to determine the specified funding levels for the revolving fund and contractual reimbursements. Similarly, there is no information on how the costs for the new digital navigator positions were calculated, as the amount and number of positions are left blank in the bill.",
  "agency_impact": "This measure will have a significant operational and administrative impact by transferring the entire Hawaii Broadband and Digital Equity Office, including its functions, staff, and resources, from DBEDT to DAGS. This move centralizes broadband coordination within the state's primary technology office, the Office of Enterprise Technology Services. The Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs will see a reduction in duties with the repeal of its broadband responsibilities and the dissolution of the advisory council it chaired.",
  "economic_impact": "The bill is intended to produce positive economic effects by creating a focused office dedicated to increasing broadband affordability, penetration, and competitive availability throughout the State. By promoting the development of broadband infrastructure and supporting the digital economy, the measure aims to enhance access to critical services like telehealth and distance education. These efforts are expected to improve Hawaii's economic competitiveness and provide long-term benefits to the community through improved digital equity.",
  "policy_impact": "This bill significantly alters state policy by consolidating broadband authority within the Office of Enterprise Technology Services, moving it from DBEDT. It amends Hawaii Revised Statutes by adding a new part to establish the Broadband Office and its revolving fund, while also repealing Chapter 206S and Section 440G-11.5, which removes previous statutory authorities related to broadband from other departments. This represents a strategic shift to centralize and streamline the state's efforts to expand digital infrastructure and equity.",
  "revenue_sources": "The initial funding for the program is sourced from an appropriation of $200,000 (HB934) from the general revenues of the State of Hawaii. This amount will capitalize the newly established Broadband Revolving Fund. Ongoing financial support for the office's activities will come from this revolving fund, which is authorized to receive proceeds from leases of state-owned broadband infrastructure, future legislative appropriations, and grants or donations from public and private sources.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The bill provides appropriations only for fiscal year 2025-2026. It allocates $200,000 (HB934) from the general fund to establish the Broadband Revolving Fund. From this fund, it appropriates $200,000 (HB934) for contract reimbursements in that same year. A separate, unspecified appropriation is authorized for an unspecified number of permanent digital navigator positions. While the bill does not provide a six-year forecast, the establishment of permanent positions implies recurring personnel costs in subsequent years. The creation of the office as a permanent entity suggests ongoing operational expenses beyond the initial fiscal year. The long-term fiscal impact will depend on the number of positions ultimately funded and the level of future legislative appropriations into the revolving fund. The revolving fund is designed to receive other revenues, such as from leases and grants, but no projections for these sources are provided. Therefore, costs beyond FY2026 are indeterminate based on this document.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The measure is expected to have a positive impact on state operating revenues by establishing the Broadband Revolving Fund. This fund is authorized to collect revenue from the proceeds of leases on state-owned broadband infrastructure, as well as gifts, donations, and grants. This creates a new, dedicated revenue stream to support the state's broadband initiatives, although the potential amount of this new revenue is not estimated in the bill.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "This bill does not contain any appropriations for capital expenditures. The funding allocated is for depositing into a revolving fund, reimbursing contracts, and establishing personnel positions. While the Broadband Office's duties involve promoting infrastructure development, the measure does not provide direct funding for capital investments in facilities, equipment, or technology infrastructure.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "After the initial six-year period, there will be ongoing fiscal obligations to sustain the Broadband Office and its personnel, including the strategic broadband coordinator and digital navigator positions. The annual operating costs will depend on the final staffing levels and program activities. The long-term sustainability of the office's funding will rely on future legislative appropriations and the success of the Broadband Revolving Fund in generating revenue from infrastructure leases and securing external grants.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "No previous fiscal note was provided for comparison."
