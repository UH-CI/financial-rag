All appropriations, records, equipment, and other personal property related to the transferred functions are also moved to the department of accounting and general services.",
  "economic_impact": "In furtherance of the State's objectives and policies for the economy, the broadband office is tasked to develop and implement plans to 'aggressively increase broadband affordability, penetration, and competitive availability in the State'. The office will also support public and private entities to 'enhance or facilitate the deployment of and access to competitively priced, advanced electronic communications services'. The measure also seeks to 'encourage public-private partnerships to increase the deployment and adoption of broadband services and applications'.",
  "policy_impact": "This act transfers the Hawaii Broadband and Digital Equity Office, renaming it the Broadband Office, and moves it from the Department of Business, Economic Development, and Tourism to the Office of Enterprise Technology Services. The bill repeals Chapter 206S, Hawaii Revised Statutes, and section 440G-11.5, Hawaii Revised Statutes, which outlines certain broadband duties of the director of commerce and consumer affairs. It also repeals the Broadband Assistance Advisory Council and establishes a new Broadband Revolving Fund.",
  "revenue_sources": "The bill establishes the broadband revolving fund, which is to be administered by the broadband office. Sources for this fund include 'Appropriations by the legislature to the revolving fund', 'Proceeds of leases of broadband infrastructure owned by the State', and 'Gifts, donations, and grants from public agencies and private persons'. The bill makes an initial appropriation of $200,000 (HB934_.HTM.txt) from the 'general revenues of the State of Hawaii' to be deposited into the fund.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The bill's specified fiscal implications are confined to fiscal year 2025-2026. For that year, there is an appropriation of $200,000 (HB934_.HTM.txt) from general revenues for deposit into the new broadband revolving fund. A subsequent appropriation of $200,000 (HB934_.HTM.txt) from the broadband revolving fund is made for 'the reimbursement of contracts executed by the broadband office'. An additional appropriation of an unspecified amount is authorized from the revolving fund to establish 'full-time equivalent (FTE) digital navigator positions'. The bill does not provide a fiscal projection beyond FY 2025-2026. However, the establishment of the broadband revolving fund creates an ongoing fiscal mechanism intended to support broadband projects, defray internet service costs, and fund technical assistance personnel. The fund is designed to receive future legislative appropriations, lease proceeds, and grants, but no multi-year projections for these revenues or expenditures are provided.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "This measure is expected to create a new source of operating revenue through the establishment of the 'broadband revolving fund'. This fund will collect 'Proceeds of leases of broadband infrastructure owned by the State' and 'Gifts, donations, and grants from public agencies and private persons'. Furthermore, 'All interest earned or accrued on moneys deposited into the revolving fund shall become a part of the revolving fund'.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The bill does not appropriate funds directly for capital expenditures. However, it authorizes moneys in the 'broadband revolving fund' to be used for 'Supporting broadband projects'. Additionally, the duties of the new broadband office include promoting 'the landing of trans-Pacific submarine cable, including the development of a shared access cable station,' which implies future capital investment.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "Ongoing fiscal obligations after the initial six-year period would consist of the operational costs for the broadband office, including salaries for the strategic broadband coordinator and the digital navigator positions. The broadband revolving fund is established as a permanent financial mechanism, with its long-term viability dependent on future appropriations and its ability to generate revenue from leases and grants. The Act's effective date of July 1, 3000, suggests indefinite fiscal implications.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "No previous fiscal note was provided for comparison."
