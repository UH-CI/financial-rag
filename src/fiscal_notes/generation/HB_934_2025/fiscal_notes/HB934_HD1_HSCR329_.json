  "overview": "The proposed measure now establishes the Hawaii Broadband and Digital Equity Special Fund, replacing the previously mentioned revolving fund. A key amendment to the bill prohibits the special fund from being used for the deployment of broadband infrastructure for retail services (HB934_HD1). Testimony clarifies the bill centralizes functions but does not repeal certain duties of the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs as previously understood (HB934_TESTIMONY_ECD_02-05-25_).",
  "appropriations": "The bill has been amended to change the specific appropriation to an unspecified amount (HB934_HD1). However, a committee report requests the Finance Committee to consider an appropriation of $200,000 (HB934_HD1_HSCR329_) to be deposited into and expended from the special fund. Testimony from the Office of Enterprise Technology Services indicates the office's actual operating budget request is $777,090 (HB934_TESTIMONY_ECD_02-05-25_) for FY 26.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal outlook is now informed by testimony from the Office of Enterprise Technology Services, which projects an operating budget need of $777,090 (HB934_TESTIMONY_ECD_02-05-25_) in FY 26, increasing to $964,815 (HB934_TESTIMONY_ECD_02-05-25_) by FY 31. These projections are based on the agency's estimated costs for personnel services and other expenses. The broader financial context includes over $400 million (HB934_TESTIMONY_ECD_02-05-25_) in federal and state commitments for infrastructure modernization.",
  "agency_impact": "While the transfer of the office remains, testimony highlights a significant gap between the recommended funding and the agency's needs. The Office of Enterprise Technology Services has identified a required FY 26 operating budget of $777,090 (HB934_TESTIMONY_ECD_02-05-25_) to successfully manage the program's responsibilities. DBEDT testimony requests that if a $200,000 (HB934_TESTIMONY_ECD_02-05-25_) appropriation is made, it should be to the general fund for operations rather than the special fund.",
  "economic_impact": "The economic context has been clarified with testimony indicating a federal and state commitment of over $400 million (HB934_TESTIMONY_ECD_02-05-25_) for infrastructure modernization. Private investment is also significant, with one provider investing $96 million (HB934_TESTIMONY_ECD_02-05-25_) in Hawaii in 2023. Additionally, Hawaii is expected to receive over $200 million (HB934_TESTIMONY_ECD_02-05-25_) in federal grants through the Broadband, Equity, Access, and Deployment Program.",
  "policy_impact": "A significant policy change has been made through an amendment that excludes the deployment of broadband infrastructure for retail service from the authorized uses of the new special fund (HB934_HD1). Contrary to the previous understanding, this measure does not repeal Section 440G-11.5, Hawaii Revised Statutes, leaving the Broadband Assistance Advisory Committee's authority intact (HB934_TESTIMONY_ECD_02-05-25_). The fund has been established as a Special Fund, not a Revolving Fund.",
  "revenue_sources": "While the initial general fund appropriation is now unspecified, new information identifies future revenue sources for the Special Fund. The fund is expected to generate revenue from negotiated lease agreements on new subsea broadband infrastructure (HB934_TESTIMONY_ECD_02-05-25_). Testimony also notes that the state is slated to receive over $200 million (HB934_TESTIMONY_ECD_02-05-25_) in federal grants for broadband infrastructure.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "New, specific long-range fiscal projections have been introduced through testimony from the Office of Enterprise Technology Services (ETS). The agency's operating budget request for the office is $777,090 (HB934_TESTIMONY_ECD_02-05-25_) for FY 26. This amount is projected to increase annually, reaching $964,815 (HB934_TESTIMONY_ECD_02-05-25_) by FY 31. These figures for personal services and other expenses represent a significant unfunded need when compared to the committee's recommended appropriation of $200,000 (HB934_HD1_HSCR329_). ETS testimony suggests the special fund would need to cover all staff salaries, benefits, and operational expenses for five years until it can become self-sustaining.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The potential for revenue generation has been more clearly defined, with testimony specifying that the new Special Fund will collect revenue from \"negotiated lease agreements\" (HB934_TESTIMONY_ECD_02-05-25_) associated with the construction of new subsea broadband infrastructure. This provides a more specific mechanism for revenue generation than previously described. The funds are intended to reduce internet service costs and support broadband projects.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The ongoing fiscal obligations are now quantified by projections from the Office of Enterprise Technology Services. The office's operating budget is expected to be approximately $964,815 (HB934_TESTIMONY_ECD_02-05-25_) by FY 31. The long-term sustainability will depend on the Special Fund's ability to generate sufficient revenue from leases to cover these recurring costs.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "This fiscal note reflects several key updates based on new committee reports and testimony. The specific appropriation of $200,000 has been removed from the bill and is now an unspecified amount, though it remains a committee recommendation (HB934_HD1). Agency testimony has introduced a significantly higher operational budget need, projecting costs of $777,090 (HB934_TESTIMONY_ECD_02-05-25_) for FY26 rising to $964,815 (HB934_TESTIMONY_ECD_02-05-25_) by FY31. The fund's purpose has been narrowed to exclude funding for retail infrastructure, and it has been established as a \"Special Fund,\" not a \"Revolving Fund.\" Additionally, testimony clarified that certain duties of the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs are not repealed by this bill, correcting a point in the previous analysis."
