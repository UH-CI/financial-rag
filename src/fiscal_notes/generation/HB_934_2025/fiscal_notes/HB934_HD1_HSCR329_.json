  "overview": "The purpose of this measure is to transfer the Hawaii Broadband and Digital Equity Office from the Department of Business, Economic Development, and Tourism to the Office of Enterprise Technology Services in the Department of Accounting and General Services and establish the Broadband and Digital Equity Special Fund. [4] This measure was amended by changing the appropriations to unspecified amounts and changing the effective date to July 1, 3000, to encourage further discussion. [4] The authorized uses of the Broadband and Digital Equity Special Fund were also amended to exclude the deployment of broadband infrastructure for the provision of retail service. [4]",
  "appropriations": "The appropriations in the bill for fiscal year 2025-2026 have been changed to unspecified amounts. [4] The Committee on Economic Development & Technology respectfully requests the Committee on Finance to consider the appropriation amount of $200,000 (HB934_HD1_HSCR329_.htm.txt) to be deposited into and appropriated out of the Broadband and Digital Equity Special Fund. [4] The Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism asked that the $200,000 (HB934_TESTIMONY_ECD_02-05-25_.PDF.txt) appropriation in the measure be added to the general fund line item as opposed to the special fund. [2]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "Testimony from the Office of Enterprise Technology Services indicates that the FY 26 operating budget request by the HBDEO is $777,090 (HB934_TESTIMONY_ECD_02-05-25_.PDF.txt) for personal services and other expenses. [2] This requested amount increases to $964,815 (HB934_TESTIMONY_ECD_02-05-25_.PDF.txt) by FY 31. [2] These figures contrast with the committee's recommended appropriation of $200,000 (HB934_HD1_HSCR329_.htm.txt). [4]",
  "agency_impact": "According to testimony, taking over the responsibility of running and managing the Hawaiʻi Broadband and Digital Equity Office would be a huge endeavor for the Office of Enterprise Technology Services (ETS). [2] To be successful in this transfer, ETS recommends that the special fund needs to fully cover all staff salaries and benefits, program priorities, operational expenses and any additional overhead, for five years until the special fund may become self-sustaining. [2] ETS also recommends adding language to the bill for “Funding positions for personnel and other necessary operating expenses to provide technical assistance to the community.” [2]",
  "economic_impact": "The federal and state governments have committed over $400 million to modernize our subsea and terrestrial infrastructure. [2] Hawaii is slated to receive over $200 million in federal grants for broadband infrastructure in the immediate future. [2] In 2023, Charter extended its network to reach an additional 9,000 homes and small businesses in Hawaii, investing $96 million (HB934_TESTIMONY_ECD_02-05-25_.PDF.txt) across the state. [2]",
  "policy_impact": "This measure was amended to change the effective date to July 1, 3000, to encourage further discussion. [4] A key policy change is the exclusion of the deployment of broadband infrastructure for the provision of retail service from the authorized uses of the Broadband and Digital Equity Special Fund. [4] The bill also repeals Chapter 206S, Hawaii Revised Statutes. [3]",
  "revenue_sources": "While the bill allows for appropriations by the legislature to the special fund, the latest version of the bill changed the appropriation out of general revenues to an unspecified amount. [3] With the construction of new subsea broadband infrastructure, our state anticipates generating revenue from negotiated lease agreements. [2] The fund can also receive gifts, donations, and grants from public agencies and private persons. [3]",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "Although the bill's appropriation for fiscal year 2025-2026 is unspecified, testimony from the Office of Enterprise Technology Services (ETS) provides a different fiscal outlook. [4] The FY 26 operating budget request by the Hawaii Broadband and Digital Equity Office (HBDEO) is $777,090 (HB934_TESTIMONY_ECD_02-05-25_.PDF.txt) for personal services and other expenses, which increases to $964,815 (HB934_TESTIMONY_ECD_02-05-25_.PDF.txt) by FY 31. [2] ETS recommends that, in order for the program to be successful with the responsibilities outlined in the bill, the special fund needs to fully cover all staff salaries and benefits, program priorities, operational expenses and any additional overhead, for five years until the special fund may become self-sustaining. [2] The transfer of employees will be without loss of salary, seniority, or other benefits. [3] The comptroller may prescribe the duties and qualifications of these employees and fix their salaries without regard to chapter 76, Hawaii Revised Statutes. [3]",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The state anticipates generating revenue from negotiated lease agreements with the construction of new subsea broadband infrastructure. [2] These proceeds of leases of broadband infrastructure owned by the State shall be deposited into the broadband and digital equity special fund. [3] The special fund will also receive gifts, donations, grants, and any interest earned or accrued on moneys deposited into the fund. [3]",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The amended measure specifies that moneys in the broadband and digital equity special fund shall be used for supporting broadband projects, but explicitly excludes the deployment of broadband infrastructure for the provision of retail service. [3] This change was made to ensure that broadband adoption efforts and broadband availability efforts are each given the independent attention needed to properly address these very different issues. [2] All existing equipment, machines, and other personal property of the Hawaii broadband and digital equity office will be transferred with the functions to which they relate. [3]",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "Testimony from the Office of Enterprise Technology Services states the operating budget request by the HBDEO increases to $964,815 (HB934_TESTIMONY_ECD_02-05-25_.PDF.txt) by FY 31, indicating a significant ongoing fiscal obligation beyond the initial six-year period. [2] The special fund is designed to become self-sustaining through revenues from leases and other sources. [2] The long-term success of the office will depend on the special fund's ability to fully cover all staff salaries and benefits, program priorities, and operational expenses. [2]",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The primary updates from the previous fiscal note are based on amendments to the bill and new information from testimony. [4] The appropriations for FY 2025-2026, previously set at $200,000, have been changed to unspecified amounts in the bill text, although the committee report recommends considering the appropriation amount of $200,000 (HB934_HD1_HSCR329_.htm.txt). [4] The bill's effective date has been changed to July 1, 3000, to encourage further discussion. [4] A significant policy change excludes the deployment of broadband infrastructure for the provision of retail service from the authorized uses of the special fund. [4] Furthermore, testimony introduced substantially higher budget projections for the Hawaii Broadband and Digital Equity Office, with a requested operating budget of $777,090 (HB934_TESTIMONY_ECD_02-05-25_.PDF.txt) for FY 2026, increasing to $964,815 (HB934_TESTIMONY_ECD_02-05-25_.PDF.txt) by FY 2031.
