  "overview": "The purpose of this measure is to transfer the Hawaii Broadband and Digital Equity Office from the Department of Business, Economic Development, and Tourism to the Office of Enterprise Technology Services in the Department of Accounting and General Services and establish the Broadband and Digital Equity Special Fund. Unlike the previous version, the office is not renamed, and testimony indicates certain statutes related to the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs are not repealed. The fund is now designated as a Special Fund, not a Revolving Fund.",
  "appropriations": "The amended bill changes the appropriations to unspecified amounts. Your Committee on Economic Development & Technology respectfully requests your Committee on Finance, should it deliberate on this measure, to consider the appropriation amount of $200,000 (HB934_HD1) to be deposited into and appropriated out of the Broadband and Digital Equity Special Fund. The Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism asks that the $200,000 (HB934_TESTIMONY_ECD_02-05-25_.PDF.txt) appropriation in the measure be added to the general fund line item as opposed to the special fund.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "Testimony from the Office of Enterprise Technology Services (ETS) provides new data for fiscal projections, noting that the FY 26 operating budget request by the Hawaii Broadband and Digital Equity Office (HBDEO) is $777,090 (HB934_TESTIMONY_ECD_02-05-25_.PDF.txt) for personal services and other expenses. This contrasts with the committee's recommended appropriation of $200,000 (HB934_HD1_HSCR329_). The Department of Budget and Finance notes it is difficult to determine whether the Broadband and Digital Equity Special Fund would be self-sustaining.",
  "agency_impact": "The Office of Enterprise Technology Services (ETS) would take over the responsibility of running and managing the Hawai ªi Broadband and Digital Equity Office. ETS testimony seeks clarity on vague or general duties and recommends that the strategic broadband coordinator be hired by the Chief Information Officer rather than the governor. ETS also recommends adding language to allow the special fund to cover 'personnel and other necessary operating expenses to provide technical assistance to the community.'",
  "economic_impact": "",
  "policy_impact": "This measure establishes the Broadband and Digital Equity Special Fund, rather than a revolving fund as previously stated. Testimony indicates that, unlike prior versions, this bill does not repeal Section 440G-11.5, Hawaii Revised Statutes, thus not removing the 'facade of DCCA participation'. The amended bill also adds a new restriction, excluding 'the deployment of broadband infrastructure for the provision of retail service from the authorized uses of the Broadband and Digital Equity Special Fund' (HB934_HD1).",
  "revenue_sources": "The bill establishes the Broadband and Digital Equity Special Fund, and the Department of Budget and Finance questions whether the fund would be financially self-sustaining. As a matter of general policy, the Department of Budget and Finance does not support the creation of any special fund which does not meet the requirements of Section 37-52.3, HRS.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "While the bill has been amended to include unspecified appropriations, new testimony provides a multi-year fiscal outlook for the Hawaii Broadband and Digital Equity Office (HBDEO). According to the Office of Enterprise Technology Services, the FY 26 operating budget request by the HBDEO is $777,090 (HB934_TESTIMONY_ECD_02-05-25_.PDF.txt) for personal services and other expenses. This requested budget increases to $964,815 (HB934_TESTIMONY_ECD_02-05-25_.PDF.txt) by FY 31. ETS recommends that the special fund needs to fully cover all staff salaries and benefits, program priorities, operational expenses and any additional overhead, for five years until the special fund may become self-sustaining. The committee report requests the Committee on Finance consider an appropriation of $200,000 (HB934_HD1), which is significantly less than the operating budget request.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The amended measure explicitly restricts the use of the Broadband and Digital Equity Special Fund by 'Excluding the deployment of broadband infrastructure for the provision of retail service from the authorized uses' (HB934_HD1). This change limits the scope of capital projects the fund can support, focusing instead on broadband adoption and affordability programs.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "Ongoing fiscal obligations will be based on the operating budget for the Hawaii Broadband and Digital Equity Office, which is projected to be $964,815 (HB934_TESTIMONY_ECD_02-05-25_.PDF.txt) by FY 31. The long-term sustainability of the office's functions will depend on future appropriations to the special fund, as testimony from the Department of Budget and Finance questions if the fund can be self-sustaining.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The updated bill and testimony introduce several key changes from the previous fiscal note. The fund is now the 'Broadband and Digital Equity Special Fund,' not a revolving fund, and its use is restricted from funding retail broadband infrastructure. Specific appropriations have been changed to 'unspecified amounts,' with the prior $200,000 (HB934_HD1_HSCR329_) figure now a recommendation from the committee. New testimony provides a detailed six-year operating budget request for the office, starting at $777,090 (HB934_TESTIMONY_ECD_02-05-25_.PDF.txt) for FY 26 and rising to $964,815 (HB934_TESTIMONY_ECD_02-05-25_.PDF.txt) by FY 31. Additionally, the office is no longer being renamed, and testimony clarifies that certain statutes related to the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs are not being repealed as previously thought."
