{
  "overview": "A specific duty from the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs—collecting and posting broadband infrastructure notices—is now explicitly transferred to the new Broadband Office. The measure also includes detailed administrative language to ensure a smooth transition of staff, records, and functions from the Department of Business, Economic Development, and Tourism to the Office of Enterprise Technology Services. This codifies the mechanics of the transfer to maintain operational continuity.",
  "appropriations": "While the measure appropriates $200,000 for contract reimbursements, testimony from the Office of Enterprise Technology Services (ETS) indicates this amount is insufficient for full operational needs. ETS highlighted that the Hawaii Broadband and Digital Equity Office's original budget request for fiscal year 2026 was $777,090, suggesting a potential operational funding shortfall. The bill does not address this larger requested amount for personnel and other operating expenses.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "It is now assumed that the current appropriations may not cover the full operational costs of the transferred office, based on agency testimony. The fiscal analysis must now account for a potential unfunded mandate, as the receiving agency has indicated its original budget request was significantly higher than the amounts provided in the bill. This discrepancy implies that additional funding may be sought to fully implement the office's functions as envisioned.",
  "agency_impact": "The impact on the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs is more clearly defined, with the specific duty of managing broadband infrastructure notices under Act 151, SLH 2011, being formally transferred to the new Broadband Office. Furthermore, the bill now includes explicit transition language to manage the transfer of civil service employees, records, and existing rules from the Department of Business, Economic Development, and Tourism to the Department of Accounting and General Services. This ensures legal and administrative continuity for staff and ongoing operations.",
  "economic_impact": "",
  "policy_impact": "A significant policy constraint has been added, explicitly prohibiting the Broadband Revolving Fund from being used for \"the deployment of broadband infrastructure for the provision of retail service.\" This change narrows the fund's scope, potentially limiting support for community-based or last-mile projects, a point of contention in public testimony. This amendment prioritizes funding for non-retail applications such as digital literacy, affordability programs, and community anchor institutions.",
  "revenue_sources": "",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The fiscal outlook is now impacted by a potential significant operational shortfall identified by the Office of Enterprise Technology Services (ETS). Agency testimony revealed a requested operational budget of $777,090 for fiscal year 2026, which is substantially greater than the $200,000 appropriated for contracts. This creates a potential unfunded pressure of over $500,000 annually for personnel and other operating costs that is not addressed in the bill. This shortfall would need to be covered by either future general fund appropriations or revenue generated by the revolving fund, which may not be immediately available. The long-term viability of the office's expanded duties without this additional funding is a key fiscal concern.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The sustainability of the office is now more uncertain, given the identified gap between appropriated funds and requested operational costs. If revenues from infrastructure leases deposited into the revolving fund are insufficient to cover the nearly $800,000 annual operational budget requested by the agency, the office will face a recurring structural deficit. This would necessitate future requests for general fund subsidies to maintain its staffing and programmatic functions beyond the initial six-year period.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The bill now contains a major policy restriction prohibiting the revolving fund from financing retail broadband infrastructure deployment. A specific duty of the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, collecting and posting infrastructure notices, is now explicitly transferred to the new office. Finally, detailed administrative provisions have been added to ensure the orderly transfer of employees, records, and rules, and agency testimony has revealed a significant potential funding shortfall, with the office's requested FY26 budget of $777,090 far exceeding the bill's current appropriations."
