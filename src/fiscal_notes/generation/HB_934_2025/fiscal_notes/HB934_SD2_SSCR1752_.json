  "agency_impact": "The Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs' (DCCA) request to consolidate duties has been incorporated into the bill. The Department of Budget and Finance (B&F) now expresses concern, stating that as a matter of general policy, B&F \"does not support the creation of any revolving fund, which does not meet the requirements of Section 37-52.4, HRS\" (HB934_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-01-25_.PDF.txt), and finds it \"difficult to determine whether the BRF would be self-sustaining\" (HB934_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-01-25_.PDF.txt). Testimony from the Office of Enterprise Technology Services (ETS) adds that with the current budget of $360,000 (HB934_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-01-25_.PDF.txt), the \"HBDEO has been operating with essentially no operating expenses for the past two fiscal years\" (HB934_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-01-25_.PDF.txt).",

  "policy_impact": "This measure has been further amended to transfer the duty of collecting and posting certain broadband infrastructure notices from the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs to the Broadband Office, as confirmed in the latest committee report (HB934_SD2_SSCR1752_.pdf). The Waianae Coast Comprehensive Health Center's testimony explicitly requests the removal of language \"excluding the deployment of broadband infrastructure for the provision of retail service” (HB934_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-01-25_.PDF.txt) to restore the bill's original intent. The bill now includes new sections ensuring the continuity of rules, personnel, and contracts during the office's transfer from the Department of Business, Economic Development, and Tourism to the Department of Accounting and General Services (HB934_SD2_.HTM.txt).",

  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The appropriations remain the same, but new testimony from the Office of Enterprise Technology Services (ETS) adds context to its larger funding needs. According to ETS testimony, the Hawaii Broadband and Digital Equity Office’s (HBDEO) original request in the upcoming biennium budget noted that “With the current budget of $360,000 (HB934_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-01-25_.PDF.txt) to fund four staff and operating expenses, HBDEO has been operating with essentially no operating expenses for the past two fiscal years\" (HB934_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-01-25_.PDF.txt). ETS reiterates that the HBDEO had requested $777,090 (HB934_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-01-25_.PDF.txt) for FY 26, consisting of $452,302 (HB934_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-01-25_.PDF.txt) for personal services and $324,788 (HB934_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-01-25_.PDF.txt) for other expenses. ETS believes these figures provide for a sound budget for the office.",
