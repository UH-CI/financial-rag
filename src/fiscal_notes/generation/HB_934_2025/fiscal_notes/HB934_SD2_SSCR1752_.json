{
  "overview": "The measure has been amended to transfer the specific duty of collecting and posting broadband infrastructure notices from the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs to the new Broadband Office (HB934_SD2). New language has been added to the bill to clarify the administrative continuity of rules, policies, and personnel during the office's transfer from the Department of Business, Economic Development, and Tourism to the Department of Accounting and General Services (HB934_SD2). These changes aim to consolidate all state broadband functions into a single entity to reduce public confusion (HB934_SD2_SSCR1752_).",
  "appropriations": "",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "While the state appropriations remain the same, new testimony provides context that Hawaii is expected to receive over $200 million (HB934_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-01-25_) in federal grants for broadband infrastructure through the Broadband, Equity, Access, and Deployment Program. However, the Department of Budget and Finance has expressed uncertainty about whether the Broadband Revolving Fund will be financially self-sustaining as intended (HB934_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-01-25_). This casts some doubt on the long-term assumptions underpinning the fund's design.",
  "agency_impact": "The Office of Enterprise Technology Services (ETS) has now identified that it will incur additional operational and administrative costs associated with managing the transferred staff and services. Specifically, ETS will bear new costs for the management of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) grant number 15-31-DS042 (HB934_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-01-25_). The bill codifies the transfer of the duty to collect and post broadband infrastructure notices from the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs to the Broadband Office (HB934_SD2). The bill now also includes detailed provisions to ensure the continuity of employees, records, and contracts during the transfer from DBEDT to DAGS (HB934_SD2).",
  "economic_impact": "In addition to previously noted investments, new testimony indicates that Hawaii is slated to receive over $200 million (HB934_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-01-25_) in federal grants specifically for broadband infrastructure via the Broadband, Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) Program. This significant federal investment is expected to supplement private and state efforts to expand broadband access. Testimony recommends these funds be prioritized for adoption and affordability programs rather than retail infrastructure projects (HB934_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-01-25_).",
  "policy_impact": "The measure now codifies the specific transfer of the duty to collect and post broadband infrastructure notices from the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs to the Broadband Office, further centralizing state broadband policy (HB934_SD2). A new policy debate has emerged in testimony concerning a clause added to the bill that prohibits the revolving fund from being used for 'the deployment of broadband infrastructure for the provision of retail service' (HB934_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-01-25_). Community advocates argue this new restriction could hinder innovative projects in unserved and underserved areas (HB934_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-01-25_).",
  "revenue_sources": "While the revolving fund is designed to be sustained by leases of state-owned infrastructure, new testimony from the Department of Budget and Finance questions whether the fund will be financially self-sustaining, raising concerns about its long-term viability without further general fund appropriations (HB934_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-01-25_). The state's overall broadband efforts will be significantly supported by external revenue, including an anticipated influx of over $200 million (HB934_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-01-25_) from the federal BEAD program. These federal funds are separate from the state's Broadband Revolving Fund.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The significant funding gap between the agency's needs and the bill's appropriations is now larger due to newly identified costs. The Office of Enterprise Technology Services (ETS) testified it will incur additional, unquantified administrative costs to manage the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) grant number 15-31-DS042 (HB934_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-01-25_). This is in addition to its previously stated need for a $777,090 (HB934_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-01-25_) operating budget for FY26, which includes $452,302 (HB934_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-01-25_) for personnel and $324,788 (HB934_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-01-25_) for other expenses. The bill only appropriates $200,000 (HB934_SD2) out of the revolving fund for contract reimbursements in FY26. This discrepancy, compounded by the new grant management costs, suggests the office will be substantially underfunded, potentially impacting its ability to carry out its expanded duties.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "New testimony from the Department of Budget and Finance raises concerns about the Broadband Revolving Fund's ability to be financially self-sustaining (HB934_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-01-25_). This introduces doubt as to whether anticipated revenues from leases of state-owned broadband infrastructure will be sufficient to cover the fund's intended expenditures without future legislative support. The long-term impact on operating revenue is therefore less certain.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The long-term fiscal sustainability of the Broadband Office is now in question, as the Department of Budget and Finance has raised doubts about the revolving fund's ability to be financially self-sustaining (HB934_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-01-25_). This suggests that ongoing general fund appropriations may be required to support the office's operations after the initial six-year period. The viability of the fund will depend on the actual revenue generated from infrastructure leases, which is currently undetermined.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "This fiscal note is updated to reflect that the bill now codifies the transfer of a specific duty—collecting and posting infrastructure notices—from the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs to the new Broadband Office (HB934_SD2). New testimony reveals the Office of Enterprise Technology Services will incur additional, unquantified costs for managing a NIST grant, exacerbating the previously identified funding gap (HB934_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-01-25_). The Department of Budget and Finance now formally questions the long-term self-sustainability of the new revolving fund (HB934_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-01-25_). Furthermore, new data shows Hawaii anticipates receiving over $200 million (HB934_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-01-25_) in federal BEAD grants, and a new policy debate has emerged over a clause restricting funding for retail service infrastructure (HB934_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-01-25_)."
