  "overview": "",
  "appropriations": "Testimony from the Office of Enterprise Technology Services (ETS) provides a specific breakdown for its funding request of $777,090 (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_) for FY 26, allocating $452,302 (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_) for personal services and $324,788 (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_) for other expenses. The latest committee report does not include the previous recommendation for a specific appropriation amount (HB934_HD1_HSCR987_). The bill continues to appropriate an unspecified amount in general funds for deposit into the special fund and an unspecified amount from the special fund for expenditures in FY 26.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The methodology is further informed by testimony from ETS, which notes the Hawaiʻi Broadband and Digital Equity Office (HBDEO) currently operates with a budget of $360,000 (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_) and has had minimal operating expenses for two years, providing a baseline for the requested increase. Additionally, testimony specifies the state's share of federal Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) funding is $149.5M (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_), which requires $46M (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_) in state matching funds. These figures provide a more detailed financial context than previously available.",
  "agency_impact": "The Office of Enterprise Technology Services (ETS) has articulated a new potential risk, stating that without proper funding, the transfer would not only fail to improve the office's function but would negatively impact critical services (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_). ETS also raised a new concern that the increased public outreach responsibilities may dilute the agency's internal focus on executive branch IT projects (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_). The Department of Budget and Finance provided new comments questioning the creation of a special fund that may not be self-sustaining (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_).",
  "economic_impact": "New testimony provides more precise figures for federal and private investment in Hawaii's broadband infrastructure. The state's share of BEAD funding is now specified as $149.5M (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_), supplemented by $46M (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_) in state matching funds. A significantly larger private investment figure has been introduced, with testimony from Hawaiian Telcom detailing a historic $1.7B (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_) investment to expand broadband infrastructure across the state.",
  "policy_impact": "The Department of Budget and Finance introduced a new policy concern, stating it does not support the creation of the special fund because it may not meet the requirements of Section 37-52.3, HRS, and questioned whether the fund would be self-sustaining (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_). New testimony from individuals provides context for the amendment prohibiting the use of funds for retail services, suggesting it was requested by a private communications utility for anti-competitive purposes (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_).",
  "revenue_sources": "More specific details on federal revenue sources are now available, with testimony identifying $149.5M (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_) in federal BEAD Program funds, which are contingent upon $46M (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_) in state matching funds. The bill appropriates an unspecified amount of general funds for FY 26 to be deposited into the Broadband and Digital Equity Special Fund (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_). However, the Department of Budget and Finance has raised new concerns about the fund's long-term ability to be financially self-sustaining (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_).",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The six-year outlook is updated with new context from the Office of Enterprise Technology Services (ETS), which states the Hawaiʻi Broadband and Digital Equity Office's (HBDEO) current budget is $360,000 (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_) for four staff members. This provides a clearer baseline for the requested FY 26 budget of $777,090 (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_), which includes $452,302 (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_) for personal services and $324,788 (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_) for other expenses. The most recent committee report does not contain the previous recommendation for a specific funding amount, meaning the funding gap now exists between the agency's request and an unspecified appropriation (HB934_HD1_HSCR987_).",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The long-term fiscal outlook is newly informed by conflicting testimony regarding the sustainability of the special fund. The Department of Budget and Finance raised doubts about whether the fund would be financially self-sustaining, as required by statute (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_). Conversely, the University of Hawaiʻi testified that the fund is necessary to ensure the long-term sustainability of the state's broadband infrastructure assets (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_).",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "This fiscal note is updated with new details from recent testimony, including a specific breakdown of the Office of Enterprise Technology Services' $777,090 (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_) budget request and context from the office's current $360,000 (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_) budget. The previous committee recommendation for a $200,000 appropriation is not present in the latest report (HB934_HD1_HSCR987_). New, more precise economic figures have been provided, including $149.5M (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_) in federal BEAD funds and a $1.7B (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_) private investment from Hawaiian Telcom. Additionally, the Department of Budget and Finance has introduced a new policy objection, questioning the special fund's compliance with state law and its ability to be self-sustaining (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_)."
