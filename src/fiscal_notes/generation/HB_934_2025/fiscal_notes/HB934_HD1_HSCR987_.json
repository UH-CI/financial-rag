  "overview": "The purpose of this measure is to transfer the Hawaii Broadband and Digital Equity Office, establish the Broadband and Digital Equity Special Fund, and appropriate funds. [6] Your Committee on Finance is in accord with the intent and purpose of H.B. No. 934, H.D. 1, and recommends that it pass Third Reading. [6] Testimony was received that an amendment prohibiting the provision of retail service was made for anti-competitive purposes at the request of Charter, a regulated communications utility. [5]",
  "appropriations": "The bill appropriates an unspecified amount in general funds and an unspecified amount in special fund ceiling for FY 26. [5] Testimony from the Office of Enterprise Technology Services (ETS) indicates the HBDEO had asked for $777,090 (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_.PDF.txt) for FY 26. [5] This request consists of $452,302 (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_.PDF.txt) for personal services, and $324,788 (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_.PDF.txt) for other expenses, and ETS asks that this funding be included in the bill. [5] [5]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The funding request is based on the HBDEO’s Form A request for Fiscal Year 25-27. [5] Testimony indicates that with the current budget of $360,000 (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_.PDF.txt) to fund four staff and operating expenses, HBDEO has been operating with essentially no operating expenses for the past two fiscal years. [5] ETS believes that the requested figures provide for a sound budget that will enable the office to meet its objectives, especially in community outreach to rural, non-Oahu areas of the state. [5] [5]",
  "agency_impact": "The Office of Enterprise Technology Services (ETS) warns that without proper funding for both salaries and operations, moving the HBDEO to DAGS-ETS would not improve its functioning and would negatively impact critical services. [5] ETS also has concerns that this shift may dilute its internal focus by diverting resources needed for this public outreach. [5] The University of Hawai‘i supports the transfer, stating it will properly align the functions of the HBDEO with other statewide technology infrastructure oversight, management and operations. [5]",
  "economic_impact": "The Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (“BEAD”) Program allocates $42.45 billion (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_.PDF.txt) to expand high-speed internet access. [5] The State share of BEAD funding is $149.5M plus $46M in state matching funds to increase broadband infrastructure and promote digital literacy services. [5] Additionally, Hawaiian Telcom continues to invest hundreds of millions of dollars annually to expand broadband infrastructure across the State. [5]",
  "policy_impact": "The transfer of the Hawaii Broadband Office provides an opportunity to consolidate and centralize broadband responsibilities currently dispersed across state government. [5] The transfer would place the office within the management and oversight of the State Chief Information Officer. [5] Testimony has been submitted stating that the bill was amended for anti-competitive purposes at the request of Charter and asks to restore the original bill’s language to allow for supporting broadband projects without restriction. [5] [5]",
  "revenue_sources": "The state anticipates generating revenue from negotiated lease agreements with the construction of new subsea broadband infrastructure. [5] The bill appropriates an unspecified amount in general funds for FY 26 to be deposited into the special fund. [5] However, the Department of Budget and Finance notes it is difficult to determine whether the Broadband and Digital Equity Special Fund would be self-sustaining. [5]",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "According to testimony, the Hawaiʻi Broadband and Digital Equity Office's (HBDEO) current budget is $360,000 (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_.PDF.txt) to fund four staff and operating expenses. [5] The office has been operating with essentially no operating expenses for the past two fiscal years. [5] The HBDEO had asked for $777,090 (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_.PDF.txt) for FY 26. [5] This includes $452,302 (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_.PDF.txt) for personal services and $324,788 (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_.PDF.txt) for other expenses. [5] The Office of Enterprise Technology Services (ETS) believes that these figures provide for a sound budget and asks that this funding be included in the bill. [5] ETS believes that without proper funding for both salaries and operations, moving the HBDEO to DAGS-ETS would negatively impact critical services delivered through its existing program. [5]",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "With the construction of new subsea broadband infrastructure, our state anticipates generating revenue from negotiated lease agreements. [5] The creation of a special fund will ensure these funds are used to reduce the cost of internet services, provide technical assistance to communities, and support broadband projects. [5] The Department of Budget and Finance stated that it is difficult to determine whether the Broadband and Digital Equity Special Fund would be self-sustaining. [5]",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "Testimony was submitted in opposition to the amendment in HD1 that prohibits the special fund from supporting the provision of retail service. [5] One testifier suggests that possible interpretations of this language could prevent even small, innovative projects in unserved or underserved communities. [5] Another testifier suggests the amendment was made for anti-competitive purposes and that the State should begin to thoughtfully consider local information needs that are not met by the commercial marketplace. [5] [5]",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "Establishment of the special fund is intended to support long term sustainability of the state's broadband infrastructure assets. [5] However, as a matter of general policy, the Department of Budget and Finance does not support the creation of the special fund. [5] Regarding this bill, the Department of Budget and Finance stated it is difficult to determine whether the special fund would be financially self-sustaining. [5]",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "New testimony provides a significantly higher appropriation request of $777,090 (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_.PDF.txt) for FY26, justified by the office's current $360,000 (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_.PDF.txt) budget having essentially no operating expenses for two years. [5] [5] The Office of Enterprise Technology Services now warns that without this proper funding, the transfer could negatively impact its existing critical services. [5] There is significant new testimony opposing the special fund's exclusion of 'retail service' projects, calling the amendment anti-competitive and requesting its removal. [5] [5] The Department of Budget and Finance has expressed new doubts about whether the proposed special fund can be financially self-sustaining. [5] The House Committee on Finance has now received testimony and recommends that the bill pass Third Reading. [6]"
