  "appropriations": "While the bill appropriates an unspecified amount, the Office of Enterprise Technology Services (ETS) testimony indicates that the Hawaiʻi Broadband and Digital Equity Office (HBDEO) had asked for $777,090 (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_.PDF.txt) for FY 26. This request is composed of $452,302 (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_.PDF.txt) for personal services and $324,788 (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_.PDF.txt) for other expenses. ETS asks that this funding be included in the bill to ensure the office can meet its objectives.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal projections are based on the HBDEO's Form A request for Fiscal Year 25-27. According to testimony, the current budget is $360,000 (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_.PDF.txt) to fund four staff and operating expenses. The testimony notes that with this funding, the \"HBDEO has been operating with essentially no operating expenses for the past two fiscal years.\"",
  "agency_impact": "The Office of Enterprise Technology Services (ETS) testimony states that \"Taking over the responsibility of running and managing the Hawaiʻi Broadband and Digital Equity Office will be a huge endeavor for ETS.\" The testimony warns that without proper funding, moving the HBDEO to DAGS-ETS \"would not improve the functioning of the HBDEO but would in fact negatively impact critical services delivered through our existing program.\" Testimony from the University of Hawai‘i supports the transfer, stating it \"will properly align the functions of the HBDEO together with other statewide technology infrastructure oversight, management and operations.\"",
  "economic_impact": "Testimony from the Lieutenant Governor states that federal and state governments have committed over $400.00 (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_.PDF.txt) to modernize infrastructure. The state anticipates generating revenue from negotiated lease agreements which will be used to reduce the cost of internet services and support broadband projects. Additionally, testimony notes the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (“BEAD”) Program allocates $42.45 (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_.PDF.txt) billion to expand high-speed internet access.",
  "policy_impact": "New testimony provides context on the bill's restriction prohibiting the special fund from supporting the provision of retail service. One individual's testimony suggests this change \"was made at the request of Charter Communications\" and that \"Possible interpretations of Charter’s language could prevent even small, innovative projects in unserved or underserved communities.\" Another individual testified that the amendment was for \"anti-competitive purposes at the request of Charter, a regulated communications utility serving the Islands.\"",
  "revenue_sources": "A new potential revenue source for the Broadband and Digital Equity Special Fund is identified in testimony from the Lieutenant Governor. It states, \"With the construction of new subsea broadband infrastructure, our state anticipates generating revenue from negotiated lease agreements.\" The Department of Budget and Finance reiterates in its testimony that \"it is difficult to determine whether the BDESF would be self-sustaining.\"",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "New testimony from the Office of Enterprise Technology Services (ETS) provides updated context for the fiscal implications, contrasting the current budget with future needs. According to the HBDEO’s Form A request, the office has a \"current budget of $360,000 (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_.PDF.txt) to fund four staff and operating expenses.\" The testimony states that with this budget, \"HBDEO has been operating with essentially no operating expenses for the past two fiscal years.\" To address this, the HBDEO requested $777,090 (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_.PDF.txt) for FY 26, which includes $452,302 (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_.PDF.txt) for personal services and $324,788 (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_.PDF.txt) for other expenses. ETS testimony states that \"Proper funding will enable the office to meet its objectives, especially in community outreach to rural, non-Oahu areas of the state.\" The agency believes these figures provide for a sound budget and asks that the funding be included in the bill. Without proper funding, ETS believes moving the office would \"negatively impact critical services.\"",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "Testimony from the Lieutenant Governor indicates a potential positive impact on operating revenue. It states that \"With the construction of new subsea broadband infrastructure, our state anticipates generating revenue from negotiated lease agreements.\" These funds are intended to be deposited into the new special fund to support broadband initiatives.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "Regarding long-term sustainability, testimony from the University of Hawai‘i states the special fund will help \"ensure the funds are used to support long term sustainability of the state's broadband infrastructure assets.\" However, the Department of Budget and Finance testimony reiterates that \"it is difficult to determine whether the BDESF would be self-sustaining.\" The ongoing fiscal obligations will depend on future appropriations and the revenue generated for the special fund.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "New testimony introduces a specific FY 26 budget request of $777,090 (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_.PDF.txt), comprising $452,302 (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_.PDF.txt) for personnel and $324,788 (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_.PDF.txt) for operations, and provides the current budget of $360,000 (HB934_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_.PDF.txt) for context. The Office of Enterprise Technology Services now explicitly warns that the transfer without this funding would \"negatively impact critical services.\" A new potential revenue stream from \"negotiated lease agreements\" on subsea infrastructure is identified. Finally, testimony provides new critical context on the policy change restricting retail service, attributing the amendment to Charter Communications and raising anti-competitive concerns."
