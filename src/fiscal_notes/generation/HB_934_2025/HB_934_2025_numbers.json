Reliable, affordable high speed internet access is essential for ensuring greater educational, economic, and social opportunities for all. The federal and state governments have committed over $400 million to modernize our subsea and terrestrial infrastructure and equip residents with the tools and knowledge to safely navigate the internet. With the construction of new subsea broadband infrastructure, our state anticipates generating revenue from negotiated lease agreements and the creation of a special fund will ensure these funds are used to reduce the cost of internet services, provide technical assistance to communities, and support broadband projects. Given the increasingly vital role of broadband in our daily lives, the transfer of HBDEO from DBEDT to ETS provides an opportunity to consolidate and centralize broadband responsibilities currently dispersed across state government,",

Reliable, affordable high speed internet access is essential for ensuring greater educational, economic, and social opportunities for all. The federal and state governments have committed over $400 million to modernize our subsea and terrestrial infrastructure and equip residents with the tools and knowledge to safely navigate the internet. With the construction of new subsea broadband infrastructure, our state anticipates generating revenue from negotiated lease agreements and the creation of a special fund will ensure these funds are used to reduce the cost of internet services, provide technical assistance to communities, and support broadband projects. Given the increasingly vital role of broadband in our daily lives, the transfer of the Hawaii Broadband Office from DBEDT to ETS provides an opportunity to consolidate and centralize broadband responsibilities currently dispersed",
