Testimony on 
H.B. 934 - RELATING TO THE HAWAII BROADBAND AND  
DIGITAL EQUITY OFFICE 
 
Chair Ilagan, Vice-Chair Hussey, and Members of the Committees: 
 
Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony in support of H.B. 934 which transfers 
the Hawaii Broadband and Digital Equity Office (HBDEO) from the Department of 
Business, Economic Development, and Tourism (DBEDT) to the Office of Enterprise 
Technology Services (ETS) in the Department of Accounting and General Services, 
establishes the Hawaii Broadband and Digital Equity Special Fund, and appropriates 
additional funding. 
 
Reliable, affordable high speed internet access is essential for ensuring greater 
educational, economic, and social opportunities for all. The federal and state 
governments have committed over $400 million to modernize our subsea and terrestrial 
infrastructure and equip residents with the tools and knowledge to safely navigate the 
internet. With the construction of new subsea broadband infrastructure, our state 
anticipates generating revenue from negotiated lease agreements and the creation of a 
special fund will ensure these funds are used to reduce the cost of internet services, 
provide technical assistance to communities, and support broadband projects. 
 
Given the increasingly vital role of broadband in our daily lives, the transfer of HBDEO 
from DBEDT to ETS provides an opportunity to consolidate and centralize broadband 
responsibilities currently dispersed across state government, including those of the 
Hawaii Broadband Assistance Advisory Council and other reporting requirements. Our 
office will work closely with the relevant departments to compile all broadband functions 
for the Legislature’s consideration. 
 
Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony in support of H.B. 934.

Time 10:00AM

In consideration of  
HB934 
RELATING TO THE HAWAII BROADBAND AND DIGITAL EQUITY OFFICE.  
 
Chair Ilagan, Vice Chair Hussey and members of the Committee.  The 
Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism (DBEDT) provides the 
following comments on HB934 that transfers the Hawaii Broadband and Digital Equity 
Office (HBDEO) to the Office of Enterprise Technology Services in the Department of 
Accounting and General Services.   
HBDEO has provided steady leadership in state broadband and digital equity. I 
am confident that regardless of where the Office resides in state government, the Office 
will continue to provide the necessary leadership and accountability in carrying out its 
statutory responsibilities and in deployment and management of federal funds. DBEDT 
will continue to collaborate with the Office as it is an important piece to the future of 
digital workforce and economic development. 
We ask that the $200,000 appropriation in the measure be added to the general 
fund line item as opposed to the special fund as the funds are necessary for standard 
operations and to support the processing of contract invoices. 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify.

Dear Representative Ilagan, and Committee Members: 
 
SUBJECT: HB934 Relating to the Hawai’i Broadband and Digital Equity Office 
The Hawai῾i State Council on Developmental Disabilities SUPPORTS HB934, transfers the 
Hawaiʻi Broadband and Digital Equity Office from the Department of Business, Economic Development, 
and Tourism to the Office of Enterprise Technology Services in the Department of Accounting and 
General Services. Establishes the Hawaiʻi Broadband and Digital Equity Special Fund. Appropriates 
funds.1 
Access to broadband and digital technology is critical for individuals with intellectual and 
developmental disabilities (I/DD) to fully participate in society. Reliable internet connectivity and digital 
literacy are essential for accessing telehealth services, engaging in educational opportunities, securing 
employment, and participating in community life. HB934 strengthens the State's infrastructure to ensure 
digital equity, especially for underserved and vulnerable populations. 
The proposed restructuring and the establishment of the special fund will enhance the State’s 
ability to develop and implement strategies to improve broadband access and affordability. The 
emphasis on supporting broadband projects, and funding positions for technical assistance aligns with 
the needs of the I/DD community, which often faces significant barriers to digital inclusion. 
Thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony in support of HB934.  
Sincerely,

TO THE HOUSE COMMITTEE ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT & TECHNOLOGY 
ON 
HOUSE BILL NO. 934 
 
February 5, 2025 
10:00 a.m. 
Room 423 and Videoconference 
 
 
RELATING TO THE HAWAII BROADBAND AND DIGITAL EQUITY OFFICE 
 
The Department of Budget and Finance (B&F) offers comments on this bill. 
 
House Bill (H.B.) No. 934:  1)  transfers the Hawai‘i Broadband and Digital Equity 
Office (HBDEO) from the Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism 
to the Office of Enterprise Technology Services in the Department of Accounting and 
General Services; 2) establishes the Broadband and Digital Equity Special Fund 
(BDESF) to be administered by HBDEO for the purposes of supporting broadband 
projects, defraying the cost of internet services, and funding positions for personnel to 
provide technical assistance for the community; 3) appropriates $200,000 in general 
funds for FY 26 to be deposited into the BDESF; and 4) appropriates $200,000 in 
special fund ceiling for the BDESF for FY 26.   
 
As a matter of general policy, B&F does not support the creation of any special 
fund, which does not meet the requirements of Section 37-52.3, HRS.  Special funds 
should:  1) serve a need as demonstrated by the purpose, scope of work, and an 
explanation why the program cannot be implemented successfully under the general  
 
 

 
-2- 
 
 
 
fund appropriation process; 2) reflect a clear nexus between the benefits sought and 
charges made upon the users or beneficiaries or a clear link between the program and 
the sources of revenue; 3) provide an appropriate means of financing for the program or 
activity; and 4) demonstrate the capacity to be financially self-sustaining.  Regarding 
H.B. No. 934, it is difficult to determine whether the BDESF would be self-sustaining. 
 
Thank you for your consideration of our comments.

Before the 
 
HOUSE COMMITTEE ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPENT & TECHNOLOGY 
Wednesday, February 5, 2025 
 
HOUSE BILL NO. 934 
RELATING TO THE HAWAIʻI BROADBAND AND DIGITAL EQUITY OFFICE 
  
Dear Chair Ilagan, Vice Chair Hussey, and members of the committee:  
  
The Office of Enterprise Technology Services (ETS) would humbly offer comments for this bill 
that transfers the Hawaiʻi Broadband and Digital Equity Office (HBDEO) from the Department of 
Business, Economic Development, and Tourism to the Office of Enterprise Technology Services 
in the Department of Accounting and General Services, establishes the Hawaiʻi Broadband and 
Digital Equity Special Fund, and appropriates funds. 
  
ETS strongly supports Connect Kākou, led by Governor Josh Green and Lieutenant Governor 
Sylvia Luke, to ensure that every resident of Hawai’i has access to broadband Internet – plus the 
skills and devices they need to use the Internet.  
  
Taking over the responsibility of running and managing the Hawaiʻi Broadband and Digital Equity 
Office would be a huge endeavor for ETS. To be successful in this transfer we would need to be 
very clear about the objectives and goals for achieving the aspirations of the bill. 
  
In several sections of the bill the definitions and/or directives are too vague or general for a clear 
understanding. Where the bill discusses the duties of the office, we would ask for more detailed 
guidance to understand the scope of the requests and to be certain about fulfilling the directives of 
the legislature.  
  
For example, on page 2, line 11, the bill asks for support for the efforts of public and private entities 
to enhance or facilitate the deployment of and access to competitively priced broadband products 
and services. On line 18 the bill seeks to promote the landing of the trans-Pacific submarine cable. 
We seek clarity on what this involves. 
  
A few other sections, including on page 3 sections (4) and (5) are also vague and we would

CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER 
LUNA ʻENEHANA      

[Type here] 
 
appreciate more specifics on what would be needed to successfully complete the goals and 
objectives the HBDEO would be assigned.  
  
On page 4, section 5, the bill asks for advise on other states’ best practices involving remote work 
and strategies for making affordable broadband services available to every home and business.  
We are seeking clarity if these responsibilities regarding remote work and strategies to make 
broadband affordable, are better aligned with departments focused on economic development and 
broadband affordability regulation.   
  
On page 6, line 11, ETS recommends adding the language to “Funding positions for personnel and 
other necessary operating expenses to provide technical assistance to the community.” 
  
On page 6, line 15, ETS recommends changing language to “subject to input by the information 
technology steering committee.”  This change would be consistent with HRS 27.43 enabling the 
information technology steering committee to assist the chief information officer in developing 
the State’s information technology standards and policies. 
  
On page 6, SECTION 3, the bill appropriates $200,000 for fiscal year 2025-2026 to support the 
special fund however, the FY 26 operating budget request by the HBDEO  is $777,090 for personal 
services and other expenses, which increases to $964,815 by FY 31.  ETS recommends that, in 
order for the program to be successful with the responsibilities outlined in the bill, the special fund 
needs to fully cover all staff salaries and benefits, program priorities, operational expenses and any 
additional overhead, for five years until the special fund may become self-sustaining. 
  
ETS also respectfully recommends the following specific changes for the committee’s 
consideration: 
  
• Page 1, line 14, please add “the Department of Accounting and General Services” before 
the Office of Enterprise Technology Services. 
• Page 1, lines 15 and 16, we ask that the strategic broadband coordinator be hired by the 
Chief Information Officer (CIO) rather than the governor. 
  
Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony on this measure.

University of Hawai‘i System 
HB 934 – RELATING TO THE HAWAII BROADBAND AND DIGITAL EQUITY OFFICE 
Chair Ilagan, Vice Chair Hussey, and Members of the Committee: 
The University of Hawai‘i, representing the interests of the State in the implementation 
of federally funded broadband investments, supports HB 934 which transfers the 
Hawaiʻi Broadband and Digital Equity Office (HBDEO) from the Department of 
Business, Economic Development, and Tourism (DBEDT) to the Office of Enterprise 
Technology Services (ETS) in the Department of Accounting and General Services, and 
establishes the Hawai‘i Broadband and Digital Equity Special Fund.  Transfer of the 
HBDEO under ETS, would place it within the management and oversight of the State 
Chief Information Officer, and will properly align the functions of the HBDEO together 
with other statewide technology infrastructure oversight, management and operations.  
The measure additionally provides for suitable governance under the statutorily 
established Information Technology Steering Committee. 
Establishment of the Hawaiʻi Broadband and Digital Equity Special Fund provides for 
the ability to collect and expend funds received as a beneficial outcome of the public 
investment in broadband infrastructure assets; and to ensure the funds are used to 
support long term sustainability of the state's broadband infrastructure assets and the 
ability of our community to benefit from those infrastructure assets.  Placing the 
ownership of the assets resulting from the federal broadband investments under the 
State Chief Information Officer, together with the Information Technology Steering 
Committee, will help to ensure the public's interest is protected and the benefits to 
Hawaiʻi maximized over the lifetime of these assets.  To help provide clarity over the 
intent of the use of the funds, we suggest the fund be titled the Hawaiʻi Broadband 
Special Fund. 
Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony in support of HB 934.

HOUSE COMMITTEE ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT & TECHNOLOGY  
Hawaii State Capitol 
Wednesday, February 5, 2025 
 
COMMENTS ON H.B. 934 – RELATING TO THE HAWAII BROADBAND AND DIGITAL EQUITY OFFICE 
 
Chair Ilagan, Vice Chair Hussey, and Members of the Committee. 
Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments and proposed amendments on H.B. 934, 
a bill that would transfer the Hawaii Broadband and Digital Equity Office to the Office of Enterprise 
Technology Services and establishes the Hawaii Broadband and Digital Equity Special Fund.  
As the largest broadband provider in the state, Charter supports efforts to promote digital 
equity and broadband access and we support the intent of this bill. A key aspect of reducing the digital 
divide is by investing in broadband infrastructure, digital navigators and literacy tools, affordability 
programs, and access to hardware.  
Charter believes that every Hawaii resident should have reliable access to the Internet. We will 
continue to help bring the benefits of broadband and access to the internet to those who need it most. 
Hawaii is slated to receive over $200 million in federal grants for broadband infrastructure in the 
immediate future (via the Broadband, Equity, Access, and Deployment Program), in addition to private 
investments already being made by the industry. The Broadband and Digital Equity Special Fund 

 
2 
 
should prioritize funding projects related to broadband adoption and affordability programs, rather 
than retail infrastructure projects, which are separately supported by federal funding.  
Charter requests amending the bill to better define the scope of broadband projects supported 
by the special fund by excluding broadband infrastructure projects for retail service. This will ensure 
that broadband adoption efforts and broadband availability efforts are each given the independent 
attention needed to properly address these very different issues. Infrastructure availability and digital 
equity are both important, but they are different problems requiring different, independent solutions. 
Specifically, we suggest the following amendments: 
• Page 6, Line 9, insert the following new language:  
(1) Supporting broadband projects, excluding the deployment of broadband infrastructure for 
the provision of retail service;  
In 2023, Charter extended its network to reach an additional 9,000 homes and small businesses 
in Hawaii, investing $96 million across the state. Charter participated in the FCC’s Emergency 
Broadband Benefit Program (EBB) and Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP), which helped connect 
over 59,000 eligible households in Hawaii with high-speed broadband. Broadband internet access is 
more important than ever and Charter offers a variety of affordable high-speed internet packages to 
meet all the connectivity and budget needs of our customers. With Spectrum Internet Assist, 
qualifying low-income families and seniors can receive high-speed internet for only $15 per month.  
Mahalo for the opportunity to provide proposed amendments to H.B. 934.

Supporting HB934 - "Relating to the Hawaii Broadband Digital Equity Office" 
 
Thank you for this opportunity to share testimony regarding HB934.  In sum, I support the intent 
of HB934 and hope you will amend the measure to address the State's need for consumer 
protection and public interest advocacy to achieve digital equity for the Islands. 
 
This measure would reorganize the Hawaii Broadband Digital Equity Office (HBDEO) currently 
under DBEDT by moving the functions to DAGS under the State’s Chief Information Officer and 
creating a “Broadband and Digital Equity Fund” to manage accounts.  An “Information 
Technology Steering Committee” appointed by the State would ensure transparency and 
accountability, one hopes. 
 
Unlike SB1045, this Bill does not remove the facade of DCCA participation by repealing Section 
440G-11.5, Hawaii Revised Statutes and disbanding the Broadband Assistance Advisory 
Committee under Act 23 of Session Laws of 2016.  Hopefully the Legislature has reviewed 
those required reports to assess DCCA’s legacy efforts in this regard.  If DCCA oversight lacks 
integrity, perhaps best to drop the pretense and find a new solution. 
 
The most notable weakness in Hawaii’s broadband investment regime is the lack of consumer 
protection and dearth of advocacy for public interests.  Essential network infrastructure is owned 
by distant corporations without local control.  Regulatory agencies lack capacity or clear 
direction.  As a result, no effective mechanism exists to ensure that State agencies consider 
consumer protections or community needs - and inequity persists.  
 
Ideally, the State will thoughtfully consider local information needs that are not met by the 
commercial marketplace, including:  public health & safety; education; community based 
economic development; culture & arts; and, civic engagement.   
 
If the proposed reforms for HBDEO are matched with effective regulation and enforcement of a 
clear social contract to benefit Hawaii’s people, this measure could go far to address the lack of 
information equity.  That is a pretty big “if.” 
 
Thanks for your thoughtful consideration of this testimony and please feel free to contact me if 
you would like more information or perspective on this issue.
