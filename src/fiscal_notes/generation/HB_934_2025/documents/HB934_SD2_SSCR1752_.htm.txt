RE:
H.B. No. 934
H.D. 1
S.D. 2
Honorable Ronald D. Kouchi
President of the Senate
Thirty-Third State Legislature
Regular Session of 2025
State of Hawaii
Sir:
Your Committee on
Ways and Means, to which was referred H.B. No. 934, H.D. 1,
S.D. 1, entitled:
"A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO THE HAWAII BROADBAND
AND DIGITAL EQUITY OFFICE,"
begs leave to report as follows:
The
purpose and intent of this measure is to consolidate and centralize government
functions relating to broadband internet access.
Specifically, this
measure:
(1)
Renames the Hawaii Broadband and Digital
Equity Office as the Broadband Office and transfers the office from the
Department of Business, Economic Development, and Tourism to the Office of
Enterprise Technology Services;
(2)
Repeals broadband duties assigned to the
Director of Commerce and Consumer Affairs;
(3)
Repeals the Broadband Assistance Advisory
Council;
(4)
Establishes positions; and
(5)
Makes appropriations.
Your Committee
received written comments in support of this measure from the Office of the
Lieutenant Governor, Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, University of
Hawaii System, Hawaii State Council on Developmental Disabilities, Charter
Communications, Waianae Coast Comprehensive Health Center, and two individuals.
Your Committee
received written comments on this measure from the Department of Budget and
Finance; Department of Business, Economic Development, and Tourism; and Office
of Enterprise Technology Services.
Your Committee
finds that it would be prudent and beneficial to consolidate broadband internet
access and related duties under a single agency.
This consolidation would reduce confusion by
having a single state office to which the public can be referred and contact regarding
broadband issues and matters.
Your Committee has
amended this measure by:
(1)
Transferring the duty of collecting and
posting certain broadband infrastructure notices pursuant to Act 151, Session
Laws of Hawaii 2011, as amended, from the Department of Commerce and Consumer
Affairs to the Broadband Office;
(2)
Inserting language that clarifies the effect
that the transfer of the Broadband Office will have on the continuity of rules,
policies, and documents;
(3)
Correcting the text of section 3 of Act 199,
Session Laws of Hawaii 2010, as amended, to reflect the printed version of the
Session Laws of Hawaii; and
(4)
Making technical nonsubstantive amendments for
purposes of clarity and consistency.
As affirmed by the
record of votes of the members of your Committee on Ways and Means that is
attached to this report, your Committee is in accord with the intent and
purpose of H.B. No. 934, H.D. 1, S.D. 1, as amended herein, and
recommends that it pass Third Reading in the form attached hereto as H.B.
No. 934, H.D. 1, S.D. 2.
Respectfully submitted on behalf
of the members of the Committee on Ways and Means,
