  "overview": "Beginning 1/1/2026, this bill requires pharmacy technicians to be registered with and obtain a certificate of registration from the Board of Pharmacy. It imposes a duty on pharmacists-in-charge to report violations conducted by registered pharmacy technicians. The measure also specifies that supervising registered pharmacists are responsible for the actions of registered pharmacy technicians and pharmacy interns.",
  "appropriations": "The provided legislative documents do not specify any appropriations for this measure. The program is expected to be supported by the fees it generates.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal analysis is based on the fee and fine structure established in the bill. The bill sets a registration fee for a pharmacy technician at $20 (HB72) and specifies that any person who violates the provisions shall be fined no less than $100 (HB72_.HTM.txt) and no more than $1,000 (HB72_.HTM.txt) for each violation. The total revenue impact is indeterminate as the number of pharmacy technicians who will register and the number of potential violations are unknown.",
  "agency_impact": "The Board of Pharmacy will be required to \"issue certificates of registration for registered pharmacy technicians\" (HB72). The board will also manage biennial renewals and will have the authority to \"fine, suspend, or revoke any license, registration, or permit\" (HB72) for non-compliance. These new responsibilities will increase the administrative and operational workload of the board.",
  "economic_impact": "This measure imposes a \"registration fee for a pharmacy technician\" of $20 (HB72), which will be paid biennially. Additionally, any person who violates the provisions of this chapter \"shall be fined no less than $100 and no more than $1,000 for each violation\" (HB72_.HTM.txt). These fees and potential fines represent a new cost for pharmacy technicians.",
  "policy_impact": "This bill amends Chapter 461, Hawaii Revised Statutes, by adding a new requirement for pharmacy technicians to be registered beginning January 1, 2026. It establishes a formal \"certificate of registration\" (HB72) and amends several sections of the statute to define the roles and responsibilities of a \"registered pharmacy technician\" (HB72). This creates a new regulatory framework for the profession under the Board of Pharmacy.",
  "revenue_sources": "The primary revenue source for this program will be \"The registration fee for a pharmacy technician,\" which \"shall be $20\" (HB72). Additional revenue may be generated from disciplinary actions, as the bill allows for fines of \"no less than $100\" (HB72_.HTM.txt) and \"no more than $1,000\" (HB72_.HTM.txt) for each violation. These revenues are intended to cover the administrative costs of the registration program.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "Beginning January 1, 2026, the Board of Pharmacy will implement the new registration requirement for pharmacy technicians. The bill states, \"Each certificate of registration shall be valid through December 31 of each odd-numbered year,\" (HB72) establishing a biennial renewal cycle. Revenue from the $20 (HB72) registration fee will be collected in the fiscal years corresponding to these odd-numbered year renewals. Within a six-year period from implementation, revenues would be collected in FY27, FY29, and FY31. The total revenue is indeterminate as the number of registered pharmacy technicians is unknown. The state may also see intermittent revenue from fines ranging from $100 (HB72_.HTM.txt) to $1,000 (HB72_.HTM.txt). The Board of Pharmacy will incur ongoing administrative costs for processing applications, managing renewals, and handling disciplinary actions related to the new registration requirements.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "This measure will generate a new source of operating revenue for the Board of Pharmacy. The revenue will come from a biennial $20 (HB72) \"registration fee for a pharmacy technician\" (HB72). Additional, but less predictable, operating revenue may result from fines for violations, which are set at \"no less than $100 and no more than $1,000 for each violation\" (HB72_.HTM.txt).",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The legislative documents provided do not identify any capital expenditures associated with this bill. It is possible that minor investments in software or technology may be required to manage the new registration process for pharmacy technicians. However, no specific funding for capital projects is mentioned.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The fiscal implications of this measure are expected to be ongoing beyond the initial six-year period. The biennial registration requirement will provide a recurring source of revenue from the $20 (HB72) fee. The Board of Pharmacy will have continuing administrative costs associated with managing the registration program for pharmacy technicians.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "No previous fiscal note was provided for comparison. This is the initial fiscal analysis for this measure."
