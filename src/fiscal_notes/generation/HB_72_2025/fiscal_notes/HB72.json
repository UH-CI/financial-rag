  "overview": "This bill proposes to regulate pharmacy technicians by requiring them to obtain a certificate of registration from the Board of Pharmacy starting January 1, 2026. The bill establishes a biennial registration process, sets a registration fee, and outlines the duties and responsibilities of registered technicians and their supervising pharmacists. It also assigns enforcement and disciplinary authority to the Board of Pharmacy over this new class of registrants.",
  "appropriations": "This bill does not appropriate any state funds for its implementation. The operations of the new registration program are expected to be funded by the fees collected from registrants. No specific appropriations for staffing, technology, or other administrative costs are included in the measure.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal projections are based on the assumption that the Board of Pharmacy will incur new administrative costs for rule-making, application processing, and enforcement for a new registrant population. Revenue is calculated based on the biennial registration fee of $20 (HB72) per technician, as specified in the bill. The total fiscal impact is indeterminate because the number of pharmacy technicians who will register is unknown.",
  "agency_impact": "The Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs' Board of Pharmacy will experience a significant impact, as it will be responsible for developing and managing the new registration program. This includes promulgating rules, creating application forms, processing registrations and renewals, and handling disciplinary actions for pharmacy technicians. The board's workload for investigations and administrative support will likely increase.",
  "economic_impact": "The measure will have a direct economic impact on pharmacy technicians, who will be required to pay a biennial registration fee of $20 (HB72). Pharmacies may incur administrative costs to verify the registration status of their employees. These costs are expected to be minimal, while the enhanced regulation aims to increase public safety and confidence in pharmacy services.",
  "policy_impact": "This bill amends Chapter 461, Hawaii Revised Statutes, to formally recognize and regulate pharmacy technicians, bringing them under the direct oversight of the Board of Pharmacy. It establishes a new professional standard that aligns Hawaii with many other states that register or license pharmacy technicians. This policy change aims to enhance patient safety by ensuring that individuals performing technician duties meet specific requirements and are accountable for their actions.",
  "revenue_sources": "The sole revenue source identified in the bill to support the new regulatory program is the registration fee. The legislative document specifies that the registration fee for a pharmacy technician shall be $20 (HB72). These fees will be collected by the Board of Pharmacy on a biennial basis and will be used to offset the administrative costs of the program.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The fiscal implications over the next six years are contingent on the number of pharmacy technicians who register. The program is set to begin on January 1, 2026, which falls in fiscal year 2026. In FY2026, the Board of Pharmacy will incur initial costs for program setup, including rule development and IT system modifications. Revenue will begin to be collected in FY2026 and FY2027 as technicians register for the first biennial cycle. The first renewal cycle will occur before December 31, 2027 (FY2028), generating another wave of revenue. Recurring costs will include staff time for processing applications, renewals, and handling complaints or disciplinary actions. While the revenue from the specified $20 (HB72) fee is intended to cover program costs, the total revenue and expenditure amounts are indeterminate. If the number of registrants is substantial, additional staffing may be required for the Board of Pharmacy to manage the increased workload. The program's costs are expected to stabilize after the initial implementation phase, becoming predictable recurring operational expenses in subsequent fiscal years (FY2029-FY2031).",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "This measure is expected to generate new operating revenue for the state. The revenue will be derived from the collection of a biennial registration fee from each pharmacy technician, which the legislative document establishes at $20 (HB72). The total increase in revenue is indeterminate as it depends on the number of individuals who register as pharmacy technicians.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "No significant capital expenditures are anticipated as a result of this bill. The Board of Pharmacy may incur minor costs related to modifying its existing IT and licensing database to accommodate the new registration category for pharmacy technicians. These modifications are likely to be treated as operational expenses rather than major capital investments.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "After the initial six-year period, the fiscal implications will consist of ongoing operational costs for the Board of Pharmacy to administer the pharmacy technician registration program. These recurring costs will include personnel expenses for processing biennial renewals, conducting investigations, and managing disciplinary actions. Revenue from the $20 (HB72) biennial registration fee is expected to continue and should be sufficient to sustain the program's long-term operational needs.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "Not applicable as no previous fiscal note was provided."
