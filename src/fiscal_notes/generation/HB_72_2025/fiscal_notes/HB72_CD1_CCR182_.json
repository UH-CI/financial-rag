[15] The Board of Pharmacy's duty to issue certificates of registration will be an ongoing administrative cost. [15] The Board may also fine, suspend, or revoke any registration, which will incur costs related to proceedings conducted pursuant to chapter 91. [15] [15] The state will forgo biennial revenue due to the deletion of the $20 (HB72_CD1_CCR182_.htm.txt) registration fee.

  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The requirement for pharmacy technicians to obtain and renew a certificate of registration is ongoing, as renewals are required biennially on or before December 31 of each odd-numbered year. [15] The administrative costs for the Board of Pharmacy to issue certificates, renew registrations, and conduct disciplinary actions will continue indefinitely. [15] [15] Revenue from fines for violations will also be a recurring, though unpredictable, fiscal component. [15]",
