[16] It also specifies that supervising registered pharmacists are responsible for the actions of registered pharmacy technicians and pharmacy interns. [16]",
  "appropriations": "The provided legislative documents do not contain any specific appropriations for this measure. [15] Your Committee on Conference has amended this measure by deleting the $20 (HB72_CD1_CCR182_.htm.txt) registration fee for pharmacy technicians. [CHUNK_66, NUMBER_0] The bill does not specify any intended uses for funding. [15]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The provided documents do not contain financial projections or a detailed cost estimation methodology. [15] The bill establishes that any person who violates the provisions of the chapter shall be fined no less than $100 (HB72_CD1_.HTM.txt) and no more than $1,000 (HB72_CD1_.HTM.txt) for each violation. [CHUNK_56, NUMBER_1, NUMBER_2] However, there is no methodology provided to estimate the revenue from these fines. [15]",
  "agency_impact": "The Board of Pharmacy will be required to issue certificates of registration for registered pharmacy technicians. [15] A new duty is imposed on the pharmacist-in-charge to notify the board, in writing, if a registered pharmacy technician is suspected to have violated any law or rule regarding the practice of pharmacy. [15] The board may also deny, revoke, or suspend any registration for causes including professional misconduct or violation of federal or state drug laws. [15]",
  "economic_impact": "This measure establishes financial penalties for non-compliance. [15] Any person who violates any of the provisions of this chapter or the rules adopted pursuant to this chapter shall be fined no less than $100 (HB72_CD1_.HTM.txt) and no more than $1,000 (HB72_CD1_.HTM.txt) for each violation. [CHUNK_56, NUMBER_1, NUMBER_2] The documents do not specify any other direct economic impacts, cost savings, or benefits to the community. [15]",

[15] It specifies that supervising registered pharmacists are responsible for the actions of registered pharmacy technicians. [15] The bill also clarifies that the supervising registered pharmacist shall supervise the actions of the pharmacy intern. [15]",
  "revenue_sources": "This measure has been amended to delete the $20 (HB72_CD1_CCR182_.htm.txt) registration fee for pharmacy technicians, removing a potential source of revenue. [CHUNK_66, NUMBER_0] The only potential revenue source identified in the bill is from disciplinary fines. [15] These fines shall be no less than $100 (HB72_CD1_.HTM.txt) and no more than $1,000 (HB72_CD1_.HTM.txt) for each violation. [CHUNK_56, NUMBER_1, NUMBER_2]",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The provided documents do not include a six-year fiscal projection. [15] A previous funding mechanism has been removed by deleting the $20 (HB72_CD1_CCR182_.htm.txt) registration fee for pharmacy technicians. [CHUNK_66, NUMBER_0] This change eliminates a recurring revenue stream that would have supported the program. [16] A new, but variable, revenue stream is created through fines for violations. [15] Any person who violates the provisions of this chapter shall be fined no less than $100 (HB72_CD1_.HTM.txt) and no more than $1,000 (HB72_CD1_.HTM.txt). [CHUNK_56, NUMBER_1, NUMBER_2] The number of registrants and potential violations is unknown, so future revenue cannot be projected.

[15] The administrative costs to the Board of Pharmacy for managing the registration and renewal process are not specified. [15] The bill does not mention any changes to staffing levels. [15] The long-term fiscal sustainability of the program without a dedicated funding source is not addressed. [16]",

[15] A potential, recurring revenue stream was eliminated by deleting the $20 (HB72_CD1_CCR182_.htm.txt) registration fee for pharmacy technicians. [CHUNK_66, NUMBER_0] However, the bill creates a new, albeit unpredictable, source of revenue by establishing fines of no less than $100 (HB72_CD1_.HTM.txt) and no more than $1,000 (HB72_CD1_.HTM.txt) for each violation of the chapter. [CHUNK_56, NUMBER_1, NUMBER_2]",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The provided legislative documents do not indicate any capital expenditures are required for this measure.

[15]",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The provided documents do not specify any ongoing fiscal obligations after a six-year period. [15] The registration program for pharmacy technicians is permanent, but with the deletion of the registration fee, there is no specified recurring funding source to cover long-term administrative costs. [16] Potential revenue from fines is unpredictable and may not be sufficient to sustain the program. [15]",
