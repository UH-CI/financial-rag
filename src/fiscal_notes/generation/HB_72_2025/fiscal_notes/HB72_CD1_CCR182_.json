  "economic_impact": "The final version of this measure eliminates the direct financial burden on pharmacy technicians seeking registration. The Conference Committee amended the bill by deleting the proposed registration fee. This change removes the previously anticipated costs for technicians to become registered.",
  "policy_impact": "The most significant policy amendment is the removal of the registration fee, which shifts the program from a self-funded model to one requiring support from the agency's general budget (HB72_CD1). Additionally, the measure's effective date has been advanced to 'upon approval', expediting its enactment (HB72_CD1). The bill now also explicitly defines the supervisory responsibilities of pharmacists-in-charge regarding registered technicians (HB72_CD1).",
  "revenue_sources": "This measure was amended to remove the only dedicated revenue source for the new registration program. The Conference Committee has deleted the $20 registration fee (HB72_CD1) for pharmacy technicians. Consequently, the program will not generate fee-based revenue to offset its administrative costs.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The fiscal outlook for this measure has been altered significantly by the removal of the registration fee. The Board of Pharmacy will now be responsible for all administrative costs associated with implementing and maintaining the pharmacy technician registration system without any offsetting revenue. These costs, which include processing applications, database management, and compliance activities, will need to be absorbed within the agency's existing operational budget. No appropriation is provided in the measure to cover these new administrative responsibilities.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "This measure will no longer generate operating revenue for the Board of Pharmacy. The amendment to delete the $20 registration fee (HB72_CD1) eliminates the anticipated revenue stream from pharmacy technician registrations. The program is now expected to have a net negative impact on the agency's operating budget.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "Beyond the initial six-year period, the Board of Pharmacy will continue to incur annual operating costs to manage the technician registration program. These ongoing expenses for renewals, database maintenance, and enforcement must be funded by the agency's general fund appropriations. The program's long-term sustainability will depend on the agency's ability to absorb these costs without a dedicated revenue source.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "This fiscal note is based on the conference draft, HB72 CD1, which contains significant amendments from prior versions. The most critical change is the deletion of the $20 registration fee (HB72_CD1) for pharmacy technicians, thereby eliminating the program's anticipated revenue source. Additionally, the bill's effective date has been changed to upon approval, and its scope has been clarified to include specific duties for pharmacists-in-charge and supervising pharmacists (HB72_CD1)."
