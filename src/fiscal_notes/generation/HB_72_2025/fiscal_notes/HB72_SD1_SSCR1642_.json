  "overview": "The purpose and intent of this measure is to, beginning January 1, 2026, require pharmacy technicians to be registered with and obtain a certificate of registration from the Board of Pharmacy. [14] [14] This measure will impose a duty on pharmacists-in-charge to report violations conducted by registered pharmacy technicians. [14] It also will specify that supervising registered pharmacists are responsible for the actions of registered pharmacy technicians and pharmacy interns. [14] [14]",
  "appropriations": "The provided legislative documents do not contain any specific appropriations for this measure. [14] Testimony suggests the initiative comes at a reasonable cost and represents a prudent investment in ensuring the safety, efficiency, and adaptability of our pharmacy workforce. [13] [13] [13] The documents do not specify any intended uses for funding such as staffing, training, or technology. [13] [14]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The provided documents do not contain financial projections or a detailed cost estimation methodology for this measure. [13] [14] The fiscal impact is described qualitatively, with testimony stating the initiative comes at a reasonable cost. [13] [13] [13] No data sources for calculating financial projections are mentioned in the bill or testimony. [13] [14]",
  "agency_impact": "The Board of Pharmacy will be required to register pharmacy technicians and issue a certificate of registration starting January 1, 2026. [14] [14] The Board of Pharmacy voted unanimously to support this measure. [13] The Board recently formed a permitted interaction group to look at the best methods to regulate pharmacy technicians for quality and general assurance. [13]",
  "economic_impact": "Your Committee finds that Hawaii is the only state that does not maintain a list of practicing pharmacy technicians, leaving a significant gap in oversight that can impact patient safety. [14] [14] This measure provides the regulatory oversight needed to ensure that these essential health care workers have the appropriate background and supervision. [14] [14] Testimony describes the measure as a prudent investment in the safety, efficiency, and adaptability of our pharmacy workforce into the future. [13] [13] [13] [13]",
  "policy_impact": "This measure builds upon Act 104 of the 2024 legislative session, which allows pharmacy technicians to administer immunizations and vaccinations. [13] [13] By establishing registration, the bill lays the foundation for pharmacy technicians in Hawai‘i to expand their scope of practice in the future, aligning with national trends. [13] [13] [13] [13] The bill addresses a significant gap, as Hawai‘i is the only state in the nation without an active, managed list of practicing pharmacy technicians. [13] [13] [13] [13] [13] [14]",
  "revenue_sources": "The provided documents for H.B. 72, H.D. 2, S.D. 1 do not identify or describe any funding sources to support the measure. [13] [14] There is no mention of general funds, grants, or fees in the committee report or submitted testimony.

  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The provided documents do not contain a six-year fiscal projection for this measure. [13] [14] The initiative is described as coming at a reasonable cost, but no specific recurring expenses are quantified. [13] [13] [13] [13] The creation of a pharmacy technician data repository is noted as an essential step forward, but any associated administrative or technology costs are not specified in the documents. [13] [13] [13] [13] Since Hawaiʻi is the only state that does not maintain a list of practicing pharmacy technicians, there is no existing data to project the number of registrants. [13] [13] [14] The Board of Pharmacy has formed a permitted interaction group to look at regulation methods, but any costs associated with this group are not detailed. [13] No staffing changes are mentioned. [13] [14] The measure does not establish a revenue stream from registration fees or fines in the provided documents. [13] [14] This measure is considered a prudent investment in the safety, efficiency, and adaptability of the pharmacy workforce. [13] [13] [13] [13]",

[13] [14] There is no mention of new revenue from registration fees, fines, or other sources. [13] [14] Therefore, no changes to the state's operating revenue streams are anticipated based on the current documents. [13] [14]",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The provided legislative documents do not indicate any capital expenditures are required for this measure. [13] [14] No investments in facilities, equipment, or technology infrastructure are mentioned in the committee report or supporting testimonies. [13] [14] The purpose of the measure is to establish a regulatory system for pharmacy technicians, not to fund capital projects. [14]",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The provided documents do not specify any ongoing fiscal obligations after a six-year period. [13] [14] The testimony suggests it is a long-term prudent investment in the pharmacy workforce, but does not quantify annual operating costs. [13] [13] [13] [13] The sustainability of the program is not addressed, as no funding sources are identified in the current documents. [13] [14]",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The primary change from the previous fiscal note is the absence of specific financial details in the current source documents. [13] [14] The previous note cited specific figures for a registration fee and fines for violations, which are not present in the committee report or testimony for H.B. 72, H.D. 2, S.D. 1. [13] [14] Additionally, the previous note mentioned an effective date of December 31, 2050, which is not mentioned in the current documents. [13] [14]",
  "fte_positions": "The provided legislative documents and testimonies for H.B. 72, H.D. 2, S.D. 1 do not specify the addition or modification of any Full Time Equivalent (FTE) positions.

  "funding_sources_changes": "There is a significant change in funding sources between the versions. [13] [14] The previous fiscal note was based on documents that established a funding source through registration fees and fines. [13] [14] The current documents for H.B. 72, H.D. 2, S.D. 1 do not specify any method of funding. [13] [14]",
  "department_impact": "The department impacted by this measure remains the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, under which the Board of Pharmacy operates. [13] [14] This is consistent with the previous version of the bill. [13] [14] The Board of Pharmacy has provided testimony in support of the measure. [13]",
  "reports_required": "The reporting requirements appear consistent with the previous version. [13] [14] The bill imposes a duty on pharmacists-in-charge to report violations conducted by registered pharmacy technicians to the Board of Pharmacy. [14] The provided documents do not specify new or modified reports to the legislature. [13] [14]",
  "pilot_program": "This measure does not create a pilot program. [14] It establishes a permanent registration requirement for pharmacy technicians beginning January 1, 2026.

  "sunset_date": "The provided documents for H.B. 72, H.D. 2, S.D. 1 do not contain a sunset date. [13] [14] This differs from the previous fiscal note, which noted a placeholder effective date of December 31, 2050, that was inserted to encourage further discussion. [13] [14]",
