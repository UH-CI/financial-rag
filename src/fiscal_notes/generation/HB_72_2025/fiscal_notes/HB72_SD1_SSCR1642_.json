  "overview": "Your Committee finds that Hawaii is the only state that does not maintain a list of practicing pharmacy technicians, leaving a significant gap in oversight that can impact patient safety. [14] This measure provides the regulatory oversight needed to ensure that these essential health care workers have the appropriate background and supervision, while also facilitating access to training opportunities and expanding their scope of practice through additional certifications. [14] This measure builds upon Act 104 that allows, in part, pharmacists, pharmacy technicians and pharmacy interns the ability to administer immunizations and vaccinations to persons three years and older under the direct supervision of a pharmacist.

  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "This initiative comes at a reasonable cost and represents a prudent investment in ensuring the safety, efficiency, and adaptability of our pharmacy workforce. [13] The registration of pharmacy technicians is important for protecting patient safety because pharmacy technicians are essential team members who are critical to the workflow of a pharmacy. [13] Currently, there is no requirement for reporting violations, so violators can easily move from one pharmacy to another.
