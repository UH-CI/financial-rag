  "overview": "The measure has advanced to the Senate and was amended by the Committee on Health and Human Services into its current form, HB72 SD1 (HB72_SD1_SSCR1082_). Key amendments include the removal of specific supervision requirements, such as the terms \"direct\" and \"physically present,\" at the request of the Board of Pharmacy to allow for more regulatory flexibility (HB72_SD1_SSCR1082_). A sunset provision has also been added, setting an effective repeal date of December 31, 2050, to encourage further discussion on the program's long-term implementation (HB72_SD1).",
  "appropriations": "",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "Financial projections are now based on a defined biennial registration fee of $20 (HB72_SD1) for each pharmacy technician. The total revenue calculation depends on the number of pharmacy technicians in the state, a figure that is not provided in the current documents. The methodology assumes revenue collection will begin with the program's start date of January 1, 2026 (HB72_SD1).",
  "agency_impact": "The Board of Pharmacy's role in enforcement has been clarified, as statutory language requiring \"direct\" and \"physically present\" supervision has been removed, giving the Board greater flexibility to define supervision standards through administrative rules (HB72_SD1_SSCR1082_). The Board will be responsible for issuing biennial certificates and collecting the $20 (HB72_SD1) registration fee. The bill also imposes a duty on pharmacists-in-charge to report violations by registered technicians to the board (HB72_SD1).",
  "economic_impact": "The measure now quantifies the cost to pharmacy technicians or their employers by establishing a biennial registration fee of $20 (HB72_SD1). This fee formalizes the economic impact on the profession, which was previously described in testimony only as a 'reasonable cost' that pharmacies were willing to bear. Widespread testimony continues to support the measure, indicating the fee is viewed as an acceptable investment for enhanced patient safety and professional standards (HB72_HD2_TESTIMONY_HHS_03-10-25_).",
  "policy_impact": "A significant policy change is the introduction of a sunset date of December 31, 2050, which means the registration program is not permanent and will require future legislative action to continue (HB72_SD1). Additionally, the removal of the terms \"direct\" and \"physically present\" from the definition of supervision shifts the responsibility for defining these standards from statute to the Board of Pharmacy's administrative rules (HB72_SD1_SSCR1082_). This provides greater adaptability for the Board in regulating the profession as practices evolve.",
  "revenue_sources": "The measure explicitly identifies the revenue source as a biennial registration fee of $20 (HB72_SD1) to be paid by each pharmacy technician. These fees will be collected by the Board of Pharmacy beginning with the program's implementation on January 1, 2026 (HB72_SD1). This replaces the previous fiscal note's assumption that fees would be the funding mechanism.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "With the establishment of a $20 (HB72_SD1) biennial registration fee, a recurring revenue stream is now defined. The program is set to begin on January 1, 2026 (HB72_SD1), with the first registrations valid through December 31, 2027. This will result in revenue collection during fiscal year 2026 for the initial registration period. Subsequent revenue from biennial renewals will be collected in fiscal years 2028, 2030, and 2032. While the total revenue amount cannot be calculated without knowing the number of pharmacy technicians in the state, the timing of the revenue collection is now clear. Administrative costs for the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs to establish and manage the registry remain unspecified. The program is subject to a sunset provision and will be repealed on December 31, 2050, unless extended by the legislature (HB72_SD1).",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The measure is now projected to generate a specific, though not yet fully quantified, amount of revenue through a biennial registration fee of $20 (HB72_SD1) per pharmacy technician. Collection of these fees will commence on January 1, 2026 (HB72_SD1). The total increase in operating revenue will be contingent on the number of technicians who register.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The long-term fiscal outlook is fundamentally changed by the inclusion of a sunset date of December 31, 2050 (HB72_SD1). Fiscal obligations are not indefinite and will cease upon the program's repeal unless future legislation extends it. Until that date, ongoing administrative costs will be offset by revenue from the $20 (HB72_SD1) biennial registration fee.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The bill has progressed to the Senate, where it was amended and designated as HB72 SD1, introducing several key changes. A specific biennial registration fee of $20 (HB72_SD1) has been established, providing a concrete figure for revenue projections that was previously absent. Additionally, a sunset date of December 31, 2050 (HB72_SD1), has been added, making the program temporary without further legislative action. Finally, amendments removed restrictive statutory language regarding pharmacist supervision, granting the Board of Pharmacy greater regulatory flexibility (HB72_SD1_SSCR1082_)."
