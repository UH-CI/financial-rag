  "overview": "The purpose and intent of this measure is to: (1) Beginning January 1, 2026, require pharmacy technicians to be registered with and obtain a certificate of registration from the Board of Pharmacy; (2) Impose a duty on pharmacists-in-charge to report violations conducted by registered pharmacy technicians; and (3) Specify that supervising registered pharmacists are responsible for the actions of registered pharmacy technicians and pharmacy interns (HB72_SD1_SSCR1082_).",
  "appropriations": "",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The measure establishes a registration fee for pharmacy technicians that \"shall be $20 (HB72_SD1).\" Violations of the chapter or its rules will result in a fine of \"no less than $100 (HB72_SD1_.HTM.txt) and no more than $1,000 (HB72_SD1_.HTM.txt) for each violation.\" The methodology for determining these specific amounts is not detailed in the provided documents.",
  "agency_impact": "The Board of Pharmacy \"voted unanimously to support this measure but requests amendments (HB72_HD2_TESTIMONY_HHS_03-10-25_).\" The bill requires the Board to \"issue certificates of registration for registered pharmacy technicians\" (HB72_SD1). The Board also requests specific amendments to \"align the measure with the Boardâ€™s current Hawaii Administrative Rules (HAR),\" including the removal of the terms \"direct\" and \"physically present\" from the bill's language regarding supervision (HB72_HD2_TESTIMONY_HHS_03-10-25_).",
  "economic_impact": "The Senate Committee on Health and Human Services finds that \"pharmacy technicians are health care professionals working under the supervision of a pharmacist and have an essential role in the daily operation of pharmacies (HB72_SD1_SSCR1082_).\" The registration of pharmacy technicians is considered \"warranted and appropriate for the level of responsibility and trust afforded by the public (HB72_SD1_SSCR1082_).\" This measure aims to ensure pharmacy technicians \"have the appropriate background and supervision, can receive timely communications and updates...and are able to access training opportunities as the scope of practice of pharmacy technicians expands nationwide (HB72_SD1_SSCR1082_).\"",
  "policy_impact": "This measure addresses the fact that \"Hawaii is the only state that does not maintain a list of practicing pharmacy technicians (HB72_SD1_SSCR1082_).\" The Senate Committee on Health and Human Services has amended the measure by \"(1) Deleting language that would have required the supervision of a registered pharmacy technician by a registered pharmacist to be 'direct'; (2) Deleting language from the definition of 'supervision' that would have required the responsible registered pharmacist to be physically present...; [and] (3) Inserting an effective date of December 31, 2050, to encourage further discussion (HB72_SD1_SSCR1082_).\"",
  "revenue_sources": "The measure establishes a new revenue source through \"The registration fee for a pharmacy technician [which] shall be $20 (HB72_SD1).\" This fee is required for a certificate that is \"valid through December 31 of each odd-numbered year,\" making it a biennial fee (HB72_SD1). Additional revenue may be generated from fines, as any person who violates the chapter \"shall be fined no less than $100 (HB72_SD1_.HTM.txt) and no more than $1,000 (HB72_SD1_.HTM.txt) for each violation.\"",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "Beginning January 1, 2026, this measure requires pharmacy technicians to obtain a certificate of registration for a fee of $20 (HB72_SD1). The certificate must be renewed biennially, as it is \"valid through December 31 of each odd-numbered year (HB72_SD1).\" This will create a recurring revenue stream for the Board of Pharmacy, with the first renewal period occurring by the end of 2027. The total revenue from these fees cannot be determined, as the number of practicing pharmacy technicians in the state is not provided. The Board of Pharmacy will also incur unspecified administrative costs to \"issue certificates of registration for registered pharmacy technicians\" (HB72_SD1) and manage the program. An additional, but unpredictable, source of revenue will come from fines for violations, which range from \"no less than $100 (HB72_SD1_.HTM.txt)\" to \"no more than $1,000 (HB72_SD1_.HTM.txt) for each violation.\"",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "This measure will generate new operating revenue for the Board of Pharmacy. Revenue will be sourced from \"The registration fee for a pharmacy technician [which] shall be $20 (HB72_SD1),\" collected on a biennial basis. Additional, variable revenue will be generated from fines assessed for violations, which are set at \"no less than $100 (HB72_SD1_.HTM.txt) and no more than $1,000 (HB72_SD1_.HTM.txt) for each violation.\"",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The provided legislative documents and testimony do not identify any capital expenditures required to implement this measure. There is no mention of investments in new facilities, equipment, or technology infrastructure. The fiscal impact appears to be limited to operating revenues and administrative costs.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The fiscal implications after the initial six-year period are expected to be ongoing. The biennial revenue from the $20 (HB72_SD1) registration fee will continue as long as the requirement is in effect. The Board of Pharmacy will have recurring administrative costs associated with managing the registration and renewal process. The bill's effective date of \"December 31, 2050 (HB72_SD1),\" was inserted \"to encourage further discussion (HB72_SD1_SSCR1082_)\", but the registration program beginning in 2026 is structured to be continuous.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "This fiscal note is updated to reflect a new official position from the Board of Pharmacy, which \"voted unanimously to support this measure but requests amendments (HB72_HD2_TESTIMONY_HHS_03-10-25_).\" Significant policy amendments were made by the Senate Committee on Health and Human Services, including \"Deleting language that would have required the supervision of a registered pharmacy technician by a registered pharmacist to be 'direct'\" and removing the requirement for a pharmacist to be \"physically present (HB72_SD1_SSCR1082_).\" New financial details have been established, including a biennial \"registration fee for a pharmacy technician [of] $20 (HB72_SD1)\" and fines between \"$100 (HB72_SD1_.HTM.txt)\" and \"$1,000 (HB72_SD1_.HTM.txt).\" A new effective date of \"December 31, 2050\" has also been inserted into the bill \"to encourage further discussion (HB72_SD1_SSCR1082_).\""
