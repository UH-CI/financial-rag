[11] However, the bill specifies that the registration fee for a pharmacy technician shall be $20.00 (HB72_SD1_.HTM.txt). [CHUNK_72, NUMBER_0] Testimony indicates that this initiative comes at a reasonable cost and represents a prudent investment. [10]",

[11] [11] The measure establishes a registration fee of $20.00 (HB72_SD1_.HTM.txt) for pharmacy technicians, which will generate revenue.

[11] The Board voted unanimously to support this measure and has already formed a permitted interaction group to look at the best methods to regulate pharmacy technicians. [10] [10]",
  "economic_impact": "Hawaiʻi is the only state that does not maintain a list of practicing pharmacy technicians, and this measure aligns Hawaiʻi with national best practices. [10] [10] This important measure will bring a regulatory framework to the critical role that pharmacy technicians fill. [10] Any person who violates any of the provisions of this chapter shall be fined no less than $100.00 (HB72_SD1_.HTM.txt) and no more than $1,000.00 (HB72_SD1_.HTM.txt) for each violation. [CHUNK_125, CHUNK_126, NUMBER_1, NUMBER_2]",
  "policy_impact": "This measure builds upon Act 104 of the 2024 legislative session that allows pharmacy technicians the ability to administer immunizations and vaccinations. [10] [10] Your Committee has amended this measure by deleting language that would have required the supervision to be \"direct\" and deleting language that would have required the pharmacist to be physically present. [12] [12] The bill also specifies that Section 26H-6, Hawaii Revised Statutes, which relates to sunrise analysis requirements, shall not apply to this Act. [11]",
  "revenue_sources": "The bill establishes a new revenue source through a registration fee for pharmacy technicians.

[CHUNK_72, NUMBER_0] Each certificate of registration shall be valid through December 31 of each odd-numbered year, upon which a new registration shall be required, suggesting a biennial renewal process. [11] Without a formal registry, there is little visibility into the number of technicians working in the state, making precise revenue projections difficult. [10] The Board of Pharmacy may also impose fines between $100.00 (HB72_SD1_.HTM.txt) and $1,000.00 (HB72_SD1_.HTM.txt) for each violation. [CHUNK_126, NUMBER_1, NUMBER_2] The creation of a pharmacy technician data repository is an essential step forward, but any associated administrative costs are not specified.

[11] The registration fee is established at $20.00 (HB72_SD1_.HTM.txt).
