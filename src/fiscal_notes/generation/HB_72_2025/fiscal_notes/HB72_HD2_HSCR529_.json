  "overview": "This measure now requires, beginning January 1, 2026, that pharmacy technicians be registered with the Board of Pharmacy and that pharmacies only employ registered pharmacy technicians to perform technician duties (HB72_HD2_HSCR529_). The measure also imposes a duty on pharmacists-in-charge to report violations by registered technicians and specifies that supervising pharmacists are responsible for the actions of registered technicians and interns (HB72_HD2_HSCR529_). Hawaii is currently the only state in the nation without an active and managed registry of practicing pharmacy technicians (HB72_HD2_HSCR529_).",
  "appropriations": "",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "With the implementation date set for January 1, 2026, fiscal impacts are now anticipated within the planning period (HB72_HD2_HSCR529_). Projections are based on potential fine revenue from violations of the chapter. Any person who violates the provisions of the chapter shall be fined \"not less than $100 (HB72_HD2_.HTM.txt) nor more than $1,000 (HB72_HD2_.HTM.txt) for each violation\" (HB72_HD2_.HTM.txt).",
  "agency_impact": "The Board of Pharmacy will be required to implement the registration of pharmacy technicians beginning January 1, 2026 (HB72_HD2_HSCR529_). The Board has been preparing for this regulation, having \"recently formed a permitted interaction group to look at best practices for regulating pharmacy technicians\" (HB72_HD2). This will entail new administrative and oversight responsibilities for the Board.",
  "economic_impact": "Testimony indicates the measure \"represents a prudent investment in the safety, efficiency, and adaptability of our pharmacy workforce\" (HB72_HD2). The initiative is described as coming at a \"reasonable cost,\" and some small businesses have stated they \"are willing to pay for these regulations\" (HB72_HD2). By mandating registration, the measure is expected to enhance patient safety and improve workforce standards (HB72_HD1_TESTIMONY_CPC_02-06-25_).",
  "policy_impact": "This measure has been amended by \"Specifically exempting this measure from the requirements for a sunrise analysis by the Office of the Auditor\" (HB72_HD2_HSCR529_). The primary policy change is the implementation of a registration requirement for pharmacy technicians beginning January 1, 2026, which aligns Hawaii with the rest of the nation, as it is currently \"the only state in the nation without an active and managed registry of practicing pharmacy technicians\" (HB72_HD2_HSCR529_). This bill builds upon Act 104, SLH 2024, by bringing a \"regulatory framework to the critical role that pharmacy technicians fill\" (HB72_HD2).",
  "revenue_sources": "Potential revenue for the State will be generated through fines imposed for violations of the registration requirements. Any person found in violation of the chapter shall be fined \"not less than $100 (HB72_HD2_.HTM.txt) nor more than $1,000 (HB72_HD2_.HTM.txt) for each violation\" (HB72_HD2_.HTM.txt). The documents do not specify any other revenue sources such as registration fees.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "Unlike the previous version of the bill, this measure now has fiscal implications within the six-year planning period due to the new effective date of January 1, 2026 (HB72_HD2_HSCR529_). Beginning in FY26, the Board of Pharmacy will incur administrative costs to establish and manage the pharmacy technician registration program. Potential revenues from fines will also begin in FY26 and continue in subsequent years. The fines for violations are specified to be \"not less than $100 (HB72_HD2_.HTM.txt) nor more than $1,000 (HB72_HD2_.HTM.txt) for each violation\" (HB72_HD2_.HTM.txt). The implementation of this registration system is intended to support public health and safety by ensuring essential health care workers have the appropriate background and supervision (HB72_HD2). The registration is considered \"a prudent initial step regarding the regulation of pharmacy technicians\" (HB72_HD2). Testimony suggests that this initiative will lay the foundation for pharmacy technicians to expand their scope of practice in the future, which could have further fiscal implications (HB72_HD2). The regulation is deemed \"reasonably necessary to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the consumers of this State\" (HB72_HD2_HSCR529_).",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The measure is expected to generate operating revenue for the State. This revenue will come from fines collected from individuals who violate the provisions of the chapter. Fines are set at \"not less than $100 (HB72_HD2_.HTM.txt) nor more than $1,000 (HB72_HD2_.HTM.txt) for each violation\" (HB72_HD2_.HTM.txt).",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "After the initial six-year period, there will be ongoing fiscal obligations related to the administration of the pharmacy technician registration program by the Board of Pharmacy. These recurring costs will be offset by potential, though variable, revenue from fines. The creation of a \"pharmacy technician data repository\" will require sustained management (HB72_HD2).",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "This fiscal note is updated to reflect significant amendments in H.B. No. 72, H.D. 2, which reactivate the fiscal impact of the measure. The previous version's effective date of July 1, 3000, has been replaced with a requirement that pharmacy technicians be registered \"beginning January 1, 2026\" (HB72_HD2_HSCR529_). Additionally, the measure has been amended by \"Specifically exempting this measure from the requirements for a sunrise analysis by the Office of the Auditor\" (HB72_HD2_HSCR529_). These changes mean that all administrative costs and potential revenue streams, which were previously deferred indefinitely, are now anticipated within the standard fiscal planning period."
