  "policy_impact": "The measure has been amended to explicitly exempt the regulation of pharmacy technicians from the sunrise analysis requirements of the Hawaii Revised Statutes (HB72_HD2_HSCR529_). This procedural change accelerates the bill's implementation by bypassing the formal review typically required for new professional regulations. This decision reflects the committee's finding that regulating this profession is necessary for public health and safety, especially since Hawaii is the only state without such a registry (HB72_HD2_HSCR529_).",

  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The bill has been significantly amended to exempt it from the sunrise analysis requirement, a procedural step that assesses the need for regulating a new profession, thereby expediting its passage and implementation (HB72_HD2_HSCR529_). The previous version's placeholder effective date of July 1, 3000, has been removed, with the bill now firmly scheduled for a January 1, 2026, implementation date, making its fiscal impact more immediate. Continued testimony from a broad range of stakeholders, including Walgreens and the University of Hawai ªi, reinforces the widespread support for aligning Hawaii with national standards (HB72_HD1_TESTIMONY_CPC_02-06-25_, HB72_HD2)."
