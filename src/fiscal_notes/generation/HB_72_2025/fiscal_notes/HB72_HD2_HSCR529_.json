  "overview": "Beginning January 1, 2026, this measure requires that pharmacy technicians be registered with the Board of Pharmacy and that pharmacies only employ registered pharmacy technicians to perform pharmacy technician duties. [7] It also imposes a duty on pharmacists-in-charge to report violations conducted by registered pharmacy technicians. [7] The measure specifies that supervising registered pharmacists are responsible for the actions of registered pharmacy technicians and pharmacy interns. [7]",
  "appropriations": "This measure does not appropriate any funds. [6] The registration fee for a pharmacy technician shall be $20.00 (HB72_HD2_.HTM.txt). [6] Any person who violates the provisions of this chapter shall be fined no less than $100.00 (HB72_HD2_.HTM.txt) and no more than $1,000.00 (HB72_HD2_.HTM.txt) for each violation. [6]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The legislative documents do not contain specific assumptions or cost estimation methodologies for the fiscal impact. [6] Financial projections are based on the fee and fine amounts established in the bill. [6] Testimony suggests the initiative comes at a reasonable cost and is a prudent investment. [5]",
  "agency_impact": "The Board of Pharmacy will be required to issue certificates of registration for registered pharmacy technicians. [6] The board may also fine, suspend, or revoke any registration for any cause prescribed by the chapter. [6] The supervising registered pharmacist shall be responsible for the actions of the registered pharmacy technician. [6]",
  "economic_impact": "Pharmacy technicians will be required to pay a registration fee of $20.00 (HB72_HD2_.HTM.txt). [6] Violations of the chapter are subject to a fine of no less than $100.00 (HB72_HD2_.HTM.txt) and no more than $1,000.00 (HB72_HD2_.HTM.txt) for each violation. [6] Your Committee finds that Hawaii is the only state in the nation without an active and managed registry of practicing pharmacy technicians, and this lack of oversight presents challenges. [7]",
  "policy_impact": "This measure amends Chapter 461, Hawaii Revised Statutes, to require the registration of pharmacy technicians beginning January 1, 2026. [6] It establishes new definitions for \"Auxiliary pharmacy personnel\", \"Registered pharmacy technician\", and \"Supervision\". [6] This version of the bill specifically exempts the measure from the requirements for a sunrise analysis by the Office of the Auditor by stating that Section 26H-6, Hawaii Revised Statutes, shall not apply. [6]",
  "revenue_sources": "Revenue will be generated through a registration fee for pharmacy technicians. [6] The registration fee is set at $20.00 (HB72_HD2_.HTM.txt). [6] Additional revenue may be generated from fines for violations, which shall be no less than $100.00 (HB72_HD2_.HTM.txt) and no more than $1,000.00 (HB72_HD2_.HTM.txt). [6]",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "Beginning January 1, 2026, the measure will generate revenue from a $20.00 (HB72_HD2_.HTM.txt) registration fee for pharmacy technicians. [6] Since each registration is valid through December 31 of each odd-numbered year, it establishes a recurring biennial revenue stream. [6] Potential additional revenue could come from fines ranging from $100.00 (HB72_HD2_.HTM.txt) to $1,000.00 (HB72_HD2_.HTM.txt) per violation. [6] The provided documents do not project the number of technicians who will register. [6] There is no information on potential staffing changes or administrative costs for the program. [6] Therefore, a detailed six-year fiscal projection cannot be accurately determined from the available information. [6] The initial registration fees would be for the biennium ending December 31, 2027. [6] Testimony states that this measure will lay the foundation for pharmacy technicians in Hawai‘i to expand their scope of practice in the future. [5] Disciplinary proceedings conducted under chapter 91 may incur administrative costs. [6] This measure represents a prudent investment in the safety, efficiency, and adaptability of the pharmacy workforce. [5]",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "This measure is expected to have a positive impact on operating revenues for the State. [6] Revenue will be generated from a biennial registration fee of $20.00 (HB72_HD2_.HTM.txt) for each pharmacy technician. [6] Additional, non-recurring revenue may be collected from fines ranging from no less than $100.00 (HB72_HD2_.HTM.txt) to no more than $1,000.00 (HB72_HD2_.HTM.txt) for each violation. [6]",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The provided legislative documents do not indicate any capital expenditures related to this measure. [6] There is no mention of required investments in facilities, equipment, or technology infrastructure. [6] The bill's focus is on regulation and registration, not capital projects. [6]",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The fiscal implications after six years will consist of ongoing biennial revenue from the pharmacy technician registration fee of $20.00 (HB72_HD2_.HTM.txt). [6] Since registrations are valid through December 31 of each odd-numbered year, the fee collection is a recurring revenue source. [6] The provided documents do not contain information to project the long-term number of registrants or the sustainability of funding. [6]",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "This version of the measure, H.B. No. 72, H.D. 2, has been amended to specifically exempt the measure from the requirements for a sunrise analysis by the Office of the Auditor. [7] Section 9 of the bill states that Section 26H-6, Hawaii Revised Statutes, shall not apply to this Act. [6] Other amendments are technical and nonsubstantive for the purposes of clarity, consistency, and style. [7]",
  "fte_positions": "The provided legislative documents do not specify the addition or modification of any Full Time Equivalent (FTE) positions. [6] There is no mention of new roles or staffing changes required to administer the registration program. [6] The bill does not address staffing levels for the Board of Pharmacy. [6]",
  "appropriations_changes": "No appropriations were specified in the previous version of the bill, and none are included in this version. [6] The measure establishes fees and fines as revenue sources rather than appropriating state funds. [6] Therefore, there are no changes to appropriations. [6]",
  "funding_sources_changes": "The method of funding is consistent with the previous version and is derived from fees and fines. [6] There are no changes in funding sources between bill versions. [6] The bill does not involve shifts between general funds and special funds. [6]",

  "reports_required": "The reporting requirements are consistent with the previous version. [6] The pharmacist-in-charge is required to notify the board, in writing, within ten days if a registered pharmacy technician is suspected to have violated any law or rule regarding the practice of pharmacy. [6] If any danger to the public health or safety exists, the pharmacist-in-charge must notify the board immediately. [6]",
  "pilot_program": "This measure does not create a pilot program for pharmacy technician registration. [6] It establishes a permanent registration requirement that begins on January 1, 2026. [6] The bill does state the board may approve pilot and demonstration research projects for innovative applications in the practice of pharmacy, but this is separate from the registration mandate. [6]",
  "sunset_date": "The provided legislative documents for HB72 HD2 do not contain a sunset date. [6] The registration requirement for pharmacy technicians is intended to be a permanent program. [6]",
  "effective_date": "The effective date remains unchanged from the H.D. 1 version of the bill. [6] This Act shall take effect on July 1, 3000. [6]"
