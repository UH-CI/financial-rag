  "overview": "This measure has been amended by 'Adding a definition of \"auxiliary pharmacy personnel\" for personnel that may be at the pharmacy, but whose duties are clerical in nature and excluding these individuals from the definition of \"pharmacy technician\"' (HB72_HD1_HSCR68_). The bill now also clarifies the duties of registered pharmacy technicians and the definition of supervision by a registered pharmacist (HB72_HD1_HSCR68_). The effective date of the act has been changed to July 1, 3000 (HB72_HD1_.HTM.txt).",
  "appropriations": "",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal impact of this measure is now projected to be zero for the foreseeable future, as the bill's effective date has been changed to July 1, 3000 (HB72_HD1_.HTM.txt). This change was made 'to encourage further discussion' (HB72_HD1_HSCR68_). All financial calculations based on registration fees and fines are therefore deferred indefinitely.",
  "agency_impact": "The administrative and operational impact on the Board of Pharmacy is delayed indefinitely due to the new effective date of July 1, 3000 (HB72_HD1_.HTM.txt). The board will not need to 'issue certificates of registration for registered pharmacy technicians' (HB72_HD1_.HTM.txt) until that time. This postpones any increase in the board's workload.",
  "economic_impact": "",
  "policy_impact": "This measure has been amended to create a new statutory category for 'Auxiliary pharmacy personnel,' defined as a person who performs tasks such as 'retrieval tasks,' 'clerical tasks,' 'accounting tasks,' and 'inventory control tasks' (HB72_HD1_.HTM.txt). The definition of 'Registered pharmacy technician' now explicitly excludes 'pharmacy interns and auxiliary pharmacy personnel' (HB72_HD1_.HTM.txt). The most significant policy change is moving the effective date to 'July 1, 3000' (HB72_HD1_.HTM.txt), effectively postponing the implementation of the registration requirement.",
  "revenue_sources": "",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "As a result of the amendment 'Changing the effective date to July 1, 3000' (HB72_HD1_HSCR68_), there are no fiscal implications within the standard six-year planning period. The previous projection of revenue collection beginning in FY27 is no longer applicable. All costs and revenues associated with 'The registration fee for a pharmacy technician' of '$20' (HB72_HD1_.HTM.txt) and fines of 'not less than $100 nor more than $1,000 for each violation' (HB72_HD1_.HTM.txt) are deferred until after the new effective date.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "There will be no impact on operating revenues in the foreseeable future. The collection of the biennial '$20' (HB72_HD1_.HTM.txt) registration fee and any potential fines is deferred until after the act's effective date of July 1, 3000 (HB72_HD1_.HTM.txt).",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "All fiscal implications for this measure are now deferred until after the new effective date of July 1, 3000 (HB72_HD1_.HTM.txt). The ongoing administrative costs and recurring revenue from registration fees will commence after that date. Therefore, there are no fiscal obligations within any practical long-term planning horizon.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "This fiscal note is updated to reflect amendments made in H.B. No. 72, H.D. 1. The primary changes from the previous fiscal note include the 'Adding a definition of \"auxiliary pharmacy personnel\"' (HB72_HD1_HSCR68_) to exempt individuals performing clerical duties from registration and 'Clarifying the duties of registered pharmacy technicians' (HB72_HD1_HSCR68_). The most significant change is the amendment 'Changing the effective date to July 1, 3000, to encourage further discussion' (HB72_HD1_HSCR68_), which postpones all fiscal impacts of the measure indefinitely."
