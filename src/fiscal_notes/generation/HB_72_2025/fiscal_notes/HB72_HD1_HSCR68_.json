  "overview": "The proposed measure has been amended to clarify its scope, now specifically excluding \"auxiliary pharmacy personnel\" who perform clerical tasks from the registration requirement. This change, based on stakeholder feedback, focuses the regulation on individuals performing core technician duties under a pharmacist's supervision. The bill still establishes a mandatory registration program with the Board of Pharmacy beginning January 1, 2026.",

  "policy_impact": "Testimony repeatedly highlights that Hawaii is the only state without a managed list of practicing pharmacy technicians, making this a key driver for aligning with national standards for patient safety (HB72_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-31-25_). The bill was amended following committee hearings to incorporate stakeholder recommendations, such as adding a new definition for \"auxiliary pharmacy personnel\" to avoid overregulating clerical staff (HB72_HD1_HSCR68_). Additionally, the measure's effective date was changed to July 1, 3000, to encourage further discussion on its implementation (HB72_HD1_HSCR68_).",
  "revenue_sources": "The revenue to support the new program will be generated from a biennial registration fee. The legislative document specifies the registration fee for a pharmacy technician shall be $20 (HB72_HD1). These fees will be collected by the Board of Pharmacy.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The program's fiscal impact remains indeterminate due to the unknown number of registrants, though revenue will be generated from the biennial $20 (HB72_HD1) registration fee. Program implementation will begin on January 1, 2026, with initial costs in FY2026 for rule development and system updates. Revenue collection will start in FY2026, with the first renewal cycle occurring in FY2028 (before December 31, 2027). Recurring costs for application processing and enforcement will be offset by this fee revenue. The financial outlook for FY2029-FY2031 depends on registrant numbers, which will become clearer after the initial registration period.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "This measure will generate new operating revenue for the Board of Pharmacy through the collection of a biennial registration fee. The legislative document establishes this fee at $20 (HB72_HD1) per technician. The total revenue impact remains indeterminate as it is dependent on the final number of registrants.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The long-term fiscal impact involves ongoing operational costs for administering the registration program, which includes processing biennial renewals and managing disciplinary actions. Revenue from the biennial $20 (HB72_HD1) registration fee is intended to fully fund these recurring program expenses. The program's sustainability will depend on the number of registered technicians.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The primary updates to the bill and its fiscal implications stem from amendments made in committee. The scope of regulation was narrowed by adding a definition for \"auxiliary pharmacy personnel,\" ensuring that only individuals performing technical pharmacy duties are required to register, which may affect the total number of registrants and ultimate revenue generated (HB72_HD1). Testimony received strongly emphasized that Hawaii is the last state to implement such regulation, providing a clearer policy justification for the measure (HB72_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-31-25_). The bill's effective date was changed to July 1, 3000, to facilitate further discussion, which defers any immediate fiscal impact (HB72_HD1)."
