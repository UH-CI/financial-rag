  "economic_impact": "This measure will have an economic impact on individuals working as pharmacy technicians, who will be required to pay a registration fee of $20.00 (HB72_HD1_.HTM.txt).

[3] Testimony indicates that as the roles of pharmacy technicians expand, it is vital to ensure these workers meet a baseline level of competency.

  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "This amended version of the measure adds a definition of \"auxiliary pharmacy personnel\" for personnel with clerical duties, excluding them from the definition of \"pharmacy technician\". [4] It also clarifies the duties of registered pharmacy technicians and what constitutes supervision by a registered pharmacist.

[4] Additionally, language regarding continuing education requirements for license renewal has been removed. [3]",

  "pilot_program": "This bill does not create a pilot program. [3] It establishes a permanent registration requirement for pharmacy technicians.
