  "overview": "This measure has been amended to narrow the scope of individuals requiring registration by adding a specific definition for 'auxiliary pharmacy personnel' who perform clerical and non-technical tasks. The bill clarifies the duties of registered pharmacy technicians and the definition of pharmacist supervision. Most significantly, the effective date has been changed to July 1, 3000, to facilitate further discussion, thereby deferring the implementation of the program.",
  "appropriations": "",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The primary assumption has changed due to the amended effective date of July 1, 3000; therefore, the measure is assumed to have no fiscal impact within the foreseeable future. The addition of an 'auxiliary pharmacy personnel' definition narrows the pool of potential registrants compared to previous estimates. Any revenue or cost calculations are now purely theoretical and postponed indefinitely.",
  "agency_impact": "Due to the change in the effective date to July 1, 3000, there is no immediate or near-term operational, administrative, or budgetary impact on the Board of Pharmacy. The previously anticipated increase in workload for rulemaking, application processing, and enforcement is now indefinitely deferred. No resources will need to be allocated for implementation during the standard fiscal planning period.",
  "economic_impact": "The economic impact of the $20 biennial registration fee on pharmacy technicians is nullified for the foreseeable future due to the measure's effective date of July 1, 3000. Consequently, there are no immediate cost implications for individuals or potential economic benefits from enhanced public safety. The professionalization of the pharmacy technician role is similarly postponed.",
  "policy_impact": "This version of the bill refines the policy by distinguishing between registered pharmacy technicians and 'auxiliary pharmacy personnel,' thereby clarifying which roles require state registration and oversight. This creates a more targeted regulatory framework than initially proposed. However, the change in the effective date to July 1, 3000, renders the policy changes moot for the time being, signaling the measure is a work in progress.",
  "revenue_sources": "While the bill still identifies a $20 biennial registration fee as the revenue source, the effective date of July 1, 3000, means no revenue will be generated for the State. The collection of these fees by the Board of Pharmacy is indefinitely postponed. Therefore, the measure will not provide any funding to offset administrative costs in the near term.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "This measure, as amended, will have no fiscal implications within the next six years. The effective date has been postponed to July 1, 3000, meaning the registration program will not be implemented and no fees will be collected during this period. Consequently, the previously anticipated startup costs for the Board of Pharmacy and any projected revenue will not be realized. There will be no recurring administrative, compliance, or enforcement costs, and no impact on staffing or operational budgets for any state agency throughout the six-year fiscal planning horizon. All fiscal effects are deferred indefinitely.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "As a result of the amended effective date of July 1, 3000, this measure will have no impact on operating revenues for the Board of Pharmacy. The collection of the proposed $20 biennial registration fee is deferred indefinitely. No new revenue stream will be established in the foreseeable future.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The fiscal implications of this program are now entirely theoretical and postponed until the year 3000 or until the effective date is amended in future legislation. There are no ongoing fiscal obligations for the State after the six-year period under the current version of the bill. The sustainability and funding of the program are not relevant concerns at this time.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The primary update is the change in the bill's effective date to July 1, 3000, which eliminates all immediate and near-term fiscal impacts previously identified. This version also introduces a new definition for 'auxiliary pharmacy personnel' to exclude those with purely clerical duties from the registration requirement, potentially reducing the number of future registrants. Additionally, the duties of registered pharmacy technicians and the definition of pharmacist 'supervision' have been clarified."
