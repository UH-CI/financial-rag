  "overview": "The measure has advanced through the legislature, with the Committee on Finance recommending it pass Third Reading after receiving widespread testimony in support (HB72_HD2_HSCR948_). The bill's purpose remains to establish a mandatory registration system for pharmacy technicians by January 1, 2026, aligning Hawaii with all other states. Testimonies from diverse stakeholders, including the University of Hawai ªi and rural pharmacies, have reinforced the broad support for this initiative to enhance patient safety and professional standards (HB72_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_).",
  "appropriations": "No appropriations are specified in the provided legislative documents or testimonies.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "No financial projections or cost estimation methodologies are provided in the documents. Multiple testimonies describe the initiative's cost as 'reasonable' or 'modest' but do not provide any specific figures or data sources to support this assessment (HB72_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_).",
  "agency_impact": "In preparation for the bill's passage, the Board of Pharmacy has formed a permitted interaction group to research best practices for regulating pharmacy technicians (HB72_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_). The Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs will be responsible for establishing and managing the registration process, maintaining a data repository of technicians, and overseeing compliance. The operational impact will include developing rules, processing applications, and handling renewals and disciplinary actions beginning January 1, 2026.",
  "economic_impact": "Testimony from a rural healthcare provider indicates that pharmacy technicians are essential to their operations, administering over 50 percent of immunizations (HB72_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_). The regulation is expected to enable an expanded scope of practice for technicians, potentially improving healthcare access and efficiency, especially in underserved areas. Testimony also confirms that small pharmacies view the measure as a prudent investment and are willing to pay for the new regulations (HB72_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_).",
  "policy_impact": "This measure directly builds on the expanded roles for pharmacy personnel established in Act 104 SLH 2024, which allowed technicians to administer immunizations (HB72_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_). The Board of Pharmacy has indicated that the implementation should recognize both national certifications and extensive on-the-job training, suggesting a flexible regulatory approach (HB72_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_). Enacting this bill will bring Hawaii into alignment with the rest of the nation, establishing a necessary legal framework for the profession.",
  "revenue_sources": "No specific revenue sources are identified, though testimony from a small pharmacy stating a willingness to 'pay for these regulations' implies that registration and renewal fees will be the primary funding mechanism to cover administrative costs (HB72_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_).",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The provided documents do not contain specific financial data needed to create a six-year fiscal projection. Information regarding the anticipated number of pharmacy technician registrants, the proposed registration and renewal fees, and the staffing requirements for the Board of Pharmacy to administer the program is absent. While the program is set to begin on January 1, 2026, the recurring administrative costs and potential revenue from fees have not been quantified. Therefore, the precise fiscal impact over the next six years remains undetermined.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The measure is expected to generate an unspecified amount of revenue for the state through registration and renewal fees collected from pharmacy technicians. However, no fee schedule or projected number of registrants is provided in the documents. These revenues would likely be deposited into a special fund to offset the program's administrative costs.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "No capital expenditures are identified in the provided documents. The implementation of a registration system may require minor modifications to existing IT infrastructure within the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, but no specific costs are mentioned.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "Long-term fiscal implications will include the ongoing administrative costs for the Board of Pharmacy to manage the technician registry, including staffing for processing renewals and conducting enforcement activities. These costs are expected to be sustained by biennial renewal fees paid by registered technicians. The financial sustainability of the program will depend on aligning fee revenue with operational expenses.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The bill has progressed legislatively, passing the House Committee on Finance and being recommended for Third Reading (HB72_HD2_HSCR948_). New testimony has provided additional context, particularly from a rural pharmacy perspective, emphasizing the critical role technicians already play in services like immunizations and the willingness of small businesses to support the regulation (HB72_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_). The Board of Pharmacy has also begun preparatory work by forming a group to study best practices, although no fiscal details or appropriations have been introduced (HB72_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_)."
