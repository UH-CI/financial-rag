  "overview": "The purpose of this measure is to establish a regulatory system for pharmacy technicians and require pharmacy technicians to be registered beginning on January 1, 2026. [9] This bill will require the registration of pharmacy technicians through the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs. [8] Beginning on 1/1/2026, the bill will require pharmacy technicians to be registered, impose a duty on pharmacists-in-charge to report violations, and specify that supervising registered pharmacists are responsible for the actions of registered pharmacy technicians and pharmacy interns. [8]",
  "appropriations": "Testimony states that HB72, HD2, comes at a reasonable price tag, and even small pharmacies such as Moloka’i Drugs are willing to pay for these regulations. [8] Other testimonies describe the initiative's cost as modest and a small investment. [8] The provided documents do not contain any specific appropriations for this measure. [9]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal analysis is based on qualitative testimony describing the measure as a prudent investment. [8] Testimonies state the modest cost of this initiative is a small investment that will have a significant impact on the safety, efficiency, and quality of care. [8] The provided documents do not contain specific cost estimation methodologies or quantitative financial projections. [9]",
  "agency_impact": "The Board of Pharmacy is supportive of the intent to provide regulation of pharmacy technicians. [8] The Board recently formed a permitted interaction group to look at best practices for regulating pharmacy technicians. [8] The Board agreed that a registration for all technicians may be a prudent initial step regarding the regulation of pharmacy technicians. [8]",
  "economic_impact": "Hawai‘i is the only state in the United States without an active, managed list of practicing pharmacy technicians. [8] The measure is described as coming at a reasonable price tag, and testimony indicates that even small pharmacies are willing to pay for these regulations. [8] Without regulation, Hawai‘i risks falling behind in providing the best possible care to our communities, especially in rural areas with limited medical resources. [8]",
  "policy_impact": "This measure builds upon Act 104 SLH 2024, which allows pharmacy technicians to administer immunizations under direct supervision of a pharmacist. [8] Walgreens supports the amendments made in H.D.2, which include defining “auxiliary personnel,” clarifying technician duties and supervision, and exempting the measure from the requirements for a sunrise analysis. [8] The bill is intended to align Hawai‘i with national pharmacy technician regulation standards to strengthen pharmacy practice. [8]",
  "revenue_sources": "The provided legislative documents do not specify any revenue sources for the program. [9] However, testimony from a rural healthcare provider indicates that 'even small pharmacies such as Moloka’i Drugs are willing to pay for these regulations'. [8] This suggests that fees may be a potential funding source, although no fee structure is outlined in the documents. [8]",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The provided documents do not contain a six-year fiscal projection. [9] Testimonies describe the measure as a prudent investment in the safety, efficiency, and adaptability of the pharmacy workforce into the future. [8] It is intended to lay the foundation for pharmacy technicians in Hawai‘i to expand their scope of practice, as is happening in other states. [8] Without regulation, Hawai‘i cannot adapt to these changes and risks falling behind in providing the best possible care. [8] The initiative is said to come at a reasonable cost. [8] A key component is the creation of a pharmacy technician data repository, which is described as an essential step forward for communicating practice and regulatory changes. [8] The Board of Pharmacy views registration as a prudent initial step. [8] No specific recurring costs or administrative expenses are detailed in the provided materials. [9] The supporting testimony focuses on the benefits to patient safety and professional standards rather than on long-term costs. [8] This measure will help Hawai'i become the 50th state of fifty to finally align our pharmacy technicians with national standards. [8]",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The provided documents do not specify any impact on operating revenues. [9] The testimonies focus primarily on public health, patient safety, and professional standards rather than on revenue generation. [8] No fees, fines, or other revenue-generating mechanisms are mentioned in the new documents. [9]",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The provided legislative documents do not indicate any capital expenditures related to this measure. [9] There is no mention of investments in facilities, equipment, or new technology infrastructure in the submitted testimonies or committee reports. [9] The bill's intent is to establish a regulatory system, not to fund capital projects. [9]",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The long-term fiscal implications are not detailed in the provided documents. [9] The measure is presented as a foundational investment that will lay the groundwork for pharmacy technicians to expand their scope of practice in the future. [8] Any ongoing fiscal obligations would likely be administrative, but these are not quantified in the available materials. [9]",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "This fiscal note incorporates new testimony for H.B. 72, H.D. 2, which was not available previously. [9] The Board of Pharmacy submitted comments indicating it is supportive of the intent to regulate pharmacy technicians and has formed a permitted interaction group to look at best practices. [8] Testimony from Walgreens explicitly supports the amendments in the H.D.2 version, including the exemption from the sunrise analysis requirement. [8] Numerous new testimonies have been received in support of the measure, all emphasizing that Hawaiʻi is the only state that does not maintain a list of practicing pharmacy technicians. [8]",
  "fte_positions": "The provided legislative documents and testimonies do not specify the addition or modification of any Full Time Equivalent (FTE) positions. [9] There is no mention of new roles or staffing changes required to administer the registration program. [9] The bill's focus is on establishing the regulatory requirement itself, not on the administrative resources needed to implement it. [9]",
  "appropriations_changes": "No appropriations were specified in previous versions, and no new appropriations are included in the current documents for H.B. 72, H.D. 2. [9] Multiple testimonies refer to the initiative's 'reasonable cost' or 'modest cost' but do not request any specific funding. [8] Therefore, there are no changes to appropriations, as none have been made. [9]",
  "funding_sources_changes": "The provided documents for this version do not specify a method of funding. [9] Testimony from Moloka’i Drugs indicates a willingness among pharmacies to pay for the regulations, but this does not constitute a formal change in funding sources. [8] No shifts between funding sources like the general fund or special funds are mentioned. [9]",
  "department_impact": "The department impacted is the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, under which the Board of Pharmacy operates. [8] New testimony from the Board of Pharmacy states it is 'supportive of the intent to provide regulation' and has already formed a 'permitted interaction group' to study best practices. [8] This indicates the Board is proactively preparing for its new regulatory responsibilities. [8]",
  "reports_required": "The reporting requirements are consistent with previous versions. [8] The measure imposes a duty on pharmacists-in-charge to report violations conducted by registered pharmacy technicians. [8] This requirement supports the bill's overall goal of increasing oversight to enhance patient safety. [8]",
  "pilot_program": "This measure does not create a pilot program. [9] It establishes a permanent regulatory system for pharmacy technicians, with a registration requirement beginning on January 1, 2026. [9] The goal is to align Hawai‘i with national standards permanently, not on a trial basis. [8]",
  "sunset_date": "The provided legislative documents for HB72 HD2 do not contain a sunset date. [9] The measure is intended to establish a permanent registration program for pharmacy technicians. [9]",
  "effective_date": "The provided documents for HB72 HD2 do not specify a valid effective date. [9] The previous fiscal note indicated a defective effective date, and no new information has been provided in the current documents to correct it. [9]"
