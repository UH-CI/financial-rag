  "agency_impact": "The Board of Pharmacy states it will meet on February 27, 2025 and take a position on this measure (HB72_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_). The Board's permitted interaction group noted the need to \"recognize national certifications provided by entities such as the Pharmacy Technician Certification Board, while still acknowledging the presence of local technicians who have received extensive on the job training\" (HB72_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_). This indicates the Board is considering a regulatory framework that accommodates different pathways for technicians.",
  "economic_impact": "Testimony from a rural healthcare provider states that their pharmacy technicians \"administer over 50 percent of our immunizations, including COVID, flu, pneumonia, RSV and shingles\" (HB72_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_). This registration is seen as a way to support the expanded role of technicians, which allows pharmacists to focus on clinical services. Testimony also confirms that the measure \"comes at a reasonable price tag, and even small pharmacies such as Moloka’i Drugs are willing to pay for these regulations\" (HB72_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_).",
  "policy_impact": "The measure is supported for amendments which \"adopt a definition of “auxiliary personnel” for personnel such as cashiers whose responsibilities are purely clerical in nature\" (HB72_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_). This policy clarification helps to define the scope of who is considered a pharmacy technician subject to the registration requirements. The House Committee on Finance is in accord with the intent of the measure and recommends that it pass Third Reading (HB72_HD2_HSCR948_).",

  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "This fiscal note is updated to reflect testimony submitted to the House Committee on Finance and the subsequent committee report. New information from the Board of Pharmacy indicates it will take an official position on February 27, 2025, and its considerations include recognizing both national certifications and extensive on-the-job training (HB72_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_). Testimony now provides specific economic impact data, with one rural pharmacy reporting that technicians administer \"over 50 percent of our immunizations\" (HB72_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_). A key policy clarification has been supported, which is the \"definition of “auxiliary personnel”\" to distinguish registered technicians from clerical staff (HB72_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_). The House Committee on Finance has recommended that H.B. No. 72, H.D. 2, pass Third Reading (HB72_HD2_HSCR948_)."
