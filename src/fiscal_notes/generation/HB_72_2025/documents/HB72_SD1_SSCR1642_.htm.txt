STAND. COM. REP. NO.

Honolulu,
Hawaii
RE:
H.B. No. 72
H.D. 2
S.D. 1
Honorable Ronald D. Kouchi
President of the Senate
Thirty-Third State Legislature
Regular Session of 2025
State of Hawaii
Sir:
Your Committee on
Commerce and Consumer Protection, to which was referred H.B. No. 72,
H.D. 2, S.D. 1, entitled:
"A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO PHARMACY,"
begs leave to report as follows:
The
purpose and intent of this measure is to:
(1)
Beginning January 1, 2026, require pharmacy
technicians to be registered with and obtain a certificate of registration from
the Board of Pharmacy;
(2)
Impose a duty on pharmacists-in-charge to
report violations conducted by registered pharmacy technicians; and
(3)
Specify that supervising registered
pharmacists are responsible for the actions of registered pharmacy technicians
and pharmacy interns.
Your Committee
received testimony in support of this measure from the University of Hawai
ʻ
i System, Board of
Pharmacy, Walgreen Co., and nine individuals.
Your Committee
finds that Hawaii is the only state that does not maintain a list of practicing
pharmacy technicians, leaving a significant gap in oversight that can impact
patient safety.
As career professionals
in the health care workforce, pharmacy technicians play an essential role in
the daily operation of pharmacies and perform functions under the supervision
of pharmacists, including the dispensing of medications, processing insurance
claims, preparing sterile compounds, and with additional certifications,
administering vaccines to patients.
This
measure provides the regulatory oversight needed to ensure that these essential
health care workers have the appropriate background and supervision, while also
facilitating access to training opportunities and expanding their scope of
practice through additional certifications.
Your Committee therefore believes the registration of pharmacy
technicians is warranted and appropriate for the level of responsibility and
trust afforded by the public.
As affirmed by the
record of votes of the members of your Committee on Commerce and Consumer
Protection that is attached to this report, your Committee is in accord with
the intent and purpose of H.B. No. 72, H.D. 2, S.D. 1, and
recommends that it pass Third Reading.
Respectfully submitted on behalf
of the members of the Committee on Commerce and Consumer Protection,
