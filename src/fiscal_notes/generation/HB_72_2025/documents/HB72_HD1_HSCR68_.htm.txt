RE:
H.B. No. 72
H.D.
1
Honorable Nadine K. Nakamura
Speaker, House of Representatives
Thirty-Third State Legislature
Regular Session of 2025
State of Hawaii
Madame:
Your Committee on Health,
to which was referred H.B. No. 72 entitled:
"A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO PHARMACY,"
begs leave to report as follows:
The
purpose of this measure
is to:
(1)
Require pharmacy
technicians to be registered with the Board of Pharmacy by January 1, 2026;
(2)
Impose a duty on
pharmacists-in-charge to report violations conducted by registered pharmacy
technicians; and
(3)
Specify that
supervising registered pharmacists are responsible for the actions of
registered pharmacy technicians and pharmacy interns.
Your Committee received testimony in support of this measure
from the Daniel K. Inouye College of Pharmacy at the University of Hawai
â€˜
i
at Hilo; KTA Pharmacy; Hawaii Pharmacists Association; and seven individuals.
Your Committee received comments on this
measure from Walgreen Co.
Your Committee finds
that Hawaii is the only state that does not maintain a list of practicing
pharmacy technicians, leaving a significant gap in oversight that can impact
patient safety.
Your Committee further
finds that pharmacy technicians are a distinct category of health care
professionals whose functions may include dispensing medications, processing
insurance claims, and administering vaccines to patients.
This measure will support public health and
safety by ensuring pharmacy technicians have the appropriate background and
supervision for their essential health care activities.
Your
Committee has amended this measure by:
(1)
Adding a definition of "auxiliary
pharmacy personnel" for personnel that may be at the pharmacy, but whose
duties are clerical in nature and excluding these individuals from the
definition of "pharmacy technician";
(2)
Clarifying the duties of registered pharmacy
technicians and what constitutes supervision of a registered pharmacy
technician by a registered pharmacist;
(3)
Changing the effective date to July 1, 3000,
to encourage further discussion; and
(4)
Making technical, nonsubstantive amendments
for the purposes of clarity, consistency, and style.
As affirmed by the
record of votes of the members of your Committee on Health that is attached to
this report, your Committee is in accord with the intent and purpose of H.B.
No. 72, as amended herein, and recommends that it pass Second Reading in the form
attached hereto as H.B. No. 72, H.D. 1, and be referred to your Committee on
Consumer Protection & Commerce.
Respectfully
submitted on behalf of the members of the Committee on Health,
