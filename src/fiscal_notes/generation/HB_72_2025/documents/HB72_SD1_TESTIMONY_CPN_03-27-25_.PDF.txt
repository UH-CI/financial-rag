On the following measure: 
H. B. 72, H.D. 2, S.D. 1, RELATING TO PHARMACY 
 
Chair Keohokalole and Members of the Committee: 
My name is James Skizewski, Executive Officer of the Board of Pharmacy 
(Board).  The Board voted unanimously to support this measure. 
 
The purpose of this bill beginning 1/1/2026 is to: (1) require pharmacy 
technicians to be registered; (2) impose a duty on pharmacists-in-charge to report 
violations conducted by registered pharmacy technicians; and (3) specify that 
supervising registered pharmacists are responsible for the actions of registered 
pharmacy technicians and pharmacy interns. 
 
The Board supports this measure’s intent to regulate pharmacy technicians.  The 
Board recently formed a permitted interaction group to look at the best methods to 
regulate pharmacy technicians for quality and general assurance.  The group noted the 
need to recognize national certifications provided by entities such as the Pharmacy 
Technician Certification Board, while still acknowledging the presence of local 
technicians who have received extensive on the job training.  
The Board agreed that a registration for all technicians may be a prudent initial 
step regarding the regulation of pharmacy technicians.  An expansion to the scope of 
practice to technicians that are nationally certified should also be recognized.  The 
expansion should include allowances such as those provided in Act 104 of the 2024 
legislative session.   
Thank you for the opportunity to testify on this bill.

HB 72 HD2 SD1 – RELATING TO PHARMACY 
Chair Keohokalole, Vice Chair Fukunaga, and Members of the Committee: 
Thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony on HB 72 HD2 SD1. The University of 
Hawaiʻi at Hilo (UH Hilo) supports HB 72 HD2 SD1, which will require the registration of 
pharmacy technicians through the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs. 
Pharmacy technicians are career professionals working under the supervision of a 
pharmacist, and have an essential role in the daily operation of pharmacies. 
 
Hawaiʻi is the only state that does not maintain a list of practicing pharmacy technicians. 
Legislation to address this oversight is important for supporting public health and safety 
by ensuring that these essential health care workers have the appropriate background 
and supervision, can receive timely communications and updates regarding relevant 
practice and regulation changes that impact their work, and facilitate access to training 
opportunities as the scope of practice of pharmacy technicians expands nationwide. 
 
We would like to emphasize that pharmacy technicians are professionals and represent 
a distinct category from pharmacy interns who are students in training to become future 
pharmacists. As career professionals in the health care workforce, pharmacy 
technicians perform functions under the supervision of pharmacists and may include 
roles such as dispensing medications, processing insurance claims, preparing sterile 
compounds such as intravenous (IV) solutions and chemotherapy, and with additional 
certifications, administering vaccines to patients. As career professionals in the health 
care workforce, the registration of pharmacy technicians is warranted and appropriate 
for the level of responsibility and trust afforded by the public. 
 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify in support of HB 72 HD2 SD1.

COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE AND CONSUMER PROTECTION 
March 27. 2025 
Testimony in SUPPORT of HB72 
  
To the Honorable Chair Keohokalole, Vice Chair Fukunaga, and Members of the Committee, 
As a pharmacist practicing in Hawai‘i, I strongly support HB72, which seeks to establish critical 
regulations for pharmacy technicians in our state. Pharmacy technicians are essential in 
performing the following tasks that are critical to the workflow of the pharmacy 
Hawai‘i is the ONLY state in the nation without an active, managed list of practicing pharmacy 
technicians, leaving a significant gap in oversight that can impact patient safety. Pharmacy 
technicians play an essential role in supporting pharmacists and ensuring the safe preparation and 
delivery of medications, and this initiative will serve as the backbone for consistent standards of 
training and competency across the profession. Additionally, the creation of a pharmacy 
technician data repository is an essential step forward, providing a centralized resource for 
communicating practice and regulatory changes. 
Beyond enhancing patient safety, HB72 will lay the foundation for pharmacy technicians in 
Hawai‘i to expand their scope of practice in the future. Across the country, pharmacy technicians 
are taking on advanced roles, such as administering immunizations and assisting with medication 
management. Without regulation, Hawai‘i cannot adapt to these changes and risks falling behind 
in providing the best possible care to our communities. This initiative comes at a reasonable cost 
and represents a prudent investment in ensuring the safety, efficiency, and adaptability of our 
pharmacy workforce. 
I urge the Committee to support HB72 and help Hawai‘i align with national pharmacy technician 
regulation standards to strengthen pharmacy practice in our state.

Dear Chair Keohokalole, Vice Chair Fukunaga, and Members of the Committee on 
Commerce and Consumer Protection: 
Walgreens submits this testimony in support of H.B. 72, HD2, SD1, which requires 
pharmacy technicians to be registered with the state. Walgreen Co. (“Walgreens”) 
operates stores at more than 9,000 locations in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, 
and Puerto Rico.  In Hawaii, Walgreens has 13 stores on the islands of Oahu and Maui. 
Walgreens supports this measure which adopts a definition of “auxiliary personnel” for 
personnel such as cashiers whose responsibilities are purely clerical in nature, clarifies 
the specific duties of a pharmacy technician, clarifies a pharmacist’s supervision of a 
technician, establishes the specific functions of a pharmacy technician in statute, and 
exempts this measure from the requirements of a sunrise analysis due to the exigent 
need for technician regulation.  
Pharmacy technicians play an important role in the pharmacy setting by handling a 
range of tasks that allow pharmacists to focus on more complex responsibilities like 
patient consultations and clinical services. For example, pharmacy technicians can 
assist pharmacists with the preparation, dispensing, and managing of patient 
medications. Typically, pharmacy technician tasks include filling prescriptions, labeling 
and packaging medications, managing medication inventory, and performing 
administrative duties such as record-keeping and insurance processing. 
The 2024 Legislature passed Act 104 that allows, in part, pharmacists, pharmacy 
technicians and pharmacy interns the ability to administer immunizations and 
vaccinations to persons three years and older under the direct supervision of a 
pharmacist. This measure builds upon Act 104 to require that pharmacy technicians are 
registered by the state. This important measure will bring a regulatory framework to the 
critical role that pharmacy technicians fill, which Walgreens supports. For these reasons, 
we ask the committee to pass this bill.  
Thank you for the opportunity to submit this testimony.

[ADVENTISTHEALTH:INTERNAL]
Testimony in Support of HB72 with Amendments to require registration for Pharmacy Technicians 
Hearing Date: March 25, 2025 
Committee: Hawaii State Senate CPN Committee 
Submitted by: Alanna Isobe 
 
Chairperson, Vice Chairperson, and Members of the Committee, 
 
Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony on HB72, which would require pharmacy technicians 
to be registered by the board of pharmacy. 
Hawaii is one of two states that do not require any sort of certification or registration.  Registration 
would be the first step towards regulating the employees who work in Hawaii’s pharmacies. Nationwide, 
the scope of practice for both pharmacists and pharmacy techs have expanded, and with this comes 
increased responsibilities and requirements.  
This bill will also require the pharmacist in charge to report violations conducted by registered 
technicians.  Currently, there is no requirement for reporting, so violators can easily move from one 
pharmacy to another.  Pharmacy technicians have access to controlled substances.  Diversion amongst 
health care workers has been a problem for the past decade and the diversion by pharmacy personnel is 
no different.   
In conclusion, I fully support HB72 because it will protect the pharmacy patients of Hawaii by taking this 
initial step toward regulating the pharmacy technicians. As roles and responsibilities change, we can rest 
assured that the right safeguards are in place. 
 
Thank you for your time, and I urge you to pass HB72. 
 
Sincerely, 
Alanna Isobe

Testimony for HB72: A bill to mandate pharmacy technician registration within the DCCA 
Senate Committee on Commerce and Consumer Protection  
Thursday, March 27, 2025 
Testimony in SUPPORT of HB72 
 
To the Honorable Chair Keohokalole, Vice Chair Fukunaga, and Members of the Committee,  
As a pharmacist practicing in Hawai‘i, I strongly support HB72, which seeks to mandate registration for 
pharmacy technicians in our state. In my practice, pharmacy technicians are essential in performing the 
non-clinical pharmacy tasks (packaging products, answering phones, addressing customers, stocking 
shelves, etc…) that are critical to the workflow of the pharmacy. 
Hawai‘i is the only state in the nation without an active, managed list of practicing pharmacy 
technicians, leaving a significant gap in oversight that can impact patient safety. Pharmacy technicians 
play an essential role in supporting pharmacists and ensuring the safe preparation and delivery of 
medications, so by requiring registration with the state there will be more accountability in practice for 
each technician.  Additionally, having pharmacy technicians registering with the state will create a data 
repository which is an essential step forward, providing a centralized resource for communicating 
practice and regulatory changes. 
Beyond enhancing patient safety, HB72 will lay the foundation for pharmacy technicians in Hawai‘i to be 
better able to expand their scope of practice in the future. Across the country, pharmacy technicians are 
taking on advanced roles, such as administering immunizations and assisting with medication 
management. Without regulation, Hawai‘i cannot adapt to these changes and risks falling behind in 
providing the best possible care to our communities. This initiative comes at a reasonable cost and 
represents a prudent investment in ensuring the safety, efficiency, and adaptability of our pharmacy 
workforce.  
I urge the Committee to support HB72 and help Hawai‘i align with national pharmacy technician 
regulation standards to strengthen pharmacy practice in our state.

Testimony for HB72-HD2-SD1: A bill to mandate pharmacy technician registration within the 
DCCA 
Committee on Commerce and Consumer Protection 
3/25/2025 
 
Testimony in SUPPORT of HB72-HD2-SD1 
 
To the Honorable Chair Keohokalole, Vice Chair  Fukunaga  and Members of the Committee on 
Commerce and Consumer Protection 
As a pharmacy student and future pharmacist, I strongly support HB72, which will establish the 
registration of pharmacy technicians in our state. Hawai‘i is the only state in the nation without 
an active, managed list of practicing pharmacy technicians. 
The registration of pharmacy technicians is important for protecting patient safety because 
pharmacy technicians are essential team members who are critical to the workflow of a 
pharmacy. Working under the supervision of pharmacists, pharmacy technicians perform 
important functions such as preparing and delivering medications safely and accurately, 
preparing and dispensing medications, using technology to print labels and enter crucial patient 
data, safely managing pharmacy inventory, processing prescriptions, processing insurance 
claims, and communicating with patients. 
Having a list of registered pharmacy technicians is absolutely crucial because it works toward 
promoting patient safety and maintaining minimum standards of training and competency across 
the profession. As pharmacy technicians expand their scope of practice and take on advanced 
roles across the country, Hawai‘i risks falling behind in providing an expected level of care in our 
communities without additional safeguards. Many people who are employed in schools and 
other industries where their work impacts public safety are also regulated. 
Given the important role of pharmacy technicians and their impact on the public, this initiative 
comes at a reasonable cost and represents a prudent investment in ensuring the safety, 
efficiency, adaptability, and quality of our pharmacy workforce. I urge the Committee to support 
HB72 and thank you for the opportunity to testify.
