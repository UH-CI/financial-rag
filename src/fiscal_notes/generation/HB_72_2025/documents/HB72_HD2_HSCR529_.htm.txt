RE:
H.B. No. 72
H.D.
2
Honorable Nadine K. Nakamura
Speaker, House of Representatives
Thirty-Third State Legislature
Regular Session of 2025
State of Hawaii
Madame:
Your Committee on Consumer
Protection & Commerce, to which was referred H.B. No. 72, H.D. 1, entitled:
"A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO PHARMACY,"
begs leave to report as follows:
The
purpose of this measure is to:
(1)
Require, beginning
January 1, 2026, that:
(A)
Pharmacy
technicians be registered with the Board of Pharmacy; and
(B)
Pharmacies only
employ registered pharmacy technicians to perform pharmacy technician duties;
(2)
Impose a duty on
pharmacists-in-charge to report violations conducted by registered pharmacy
technicians; and
(3)
Specify that
supervising registered pharmacists are responsible for the actions of
registered pharmacy technicians and pharmacy interns.
Your Committee received testimony in support of this measure
from the University of Hawai
ʻ
i at Hilo; Hawaii
Pharmacists Association; Walgreen Co.; KTA Pharmacy; Moloka
ʻ
i
Drugs, Inc.; and seven individuals.
Your
Committee received comments on this measure from the Board of Pharmacy.
Your Committee finds that pharmacy technicians play an essential
role in supporting pharmacists and ensuring the safe and efficient delivery of
medications.
Under the supervision of a
pharmacist in the community setting, pharmacy technicians can fill and dispense
medications, process insurance claims, and with additional training, administer
vaccinations.
In the hospital setting,
pharmacy technicians are relied upon to support the compounding of intravenous
medications and to stock medication cabinet and other medication delivery
systems.
Your Committee further finds that Hawaii is the only state in
the nation without an active and managed registry of practicing pharmacy
technicians.
This lack of oversight
presents challenges in ensuring consistent training, competency, and
accountability within the pharmacy technician workforce.
As such, your Committee finds that the
regulation of pharmacy technicians is reasonably necessary to protect the
health, safety, and welfare of the consumers of this State.
Accordingly, your Committee has amended this measure by:
(1)
Specifically exempting this measure from the
requirements for a sunrise analysis by the Office of the Auditor; and
(2)
Making technical, nonsubstantive amendments
for the purposes of clarity, consistency, and style.
As affirmed by the
record of votes of the members of your Committee on Consumer Protection &
Commerce that is attached to this report, your Committee is in accord with the
intent and purpose of H.B. No. 72, H.D. 1, as amended herein, and recommends
that it be referred to your Committee on Finance in the form attached hereto as
H.B. No. 72, H.D. 2.
Respectfully
submitted on behalf of the members of the Committee on Consumer Protection
& Commerce,
