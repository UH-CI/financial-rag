HB 72 HD2 – RELATING TO PHARMACY 
Chair Yamashita, Vice Chair Takenouchi, and Members of the Committee: 
Thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony on HB 72 HD2. The University of 
Hawaiʻi at Hilo (UH Hilo) supports HB 72 HD2, which will require the registration of 
pharmacy technicians through the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs. 
Pharmacy technicians are career professionals working under the supervision of a 
pharmacist, and have an essential role in the daily operation of pharmacies. 
 
Hawaiʻi is the only state that does not maintain a list of practicing pharmacy technicians. 
Legislation to address this oversight is important for supporting public health and safety 
by ensuring that these essential health care workers have the appropriate background 
and supervision, can receive timely communications and updates regarding relevant 
practice and regulation changes that impact their work, and facilitate access to training 
opportunities as the scope of practice of pharmacy technicians expands nationwide. 
 
We would like to emphasize that pharmacy technicians are professionals and represent 
a distinct category from pharmacy interns who are students in training to become future 
pharmacists. As career professionals in the health care workforce, pharmacy 
technicians perform functions under the supervision of pharmacists and may include 
roles such as dispensing medications, processing insurance claims, preparing sterile 
compounds such as intravenous (IV) solutions and chemotherapy, and with additional 
certifications, administering vaccines to patients. As career professionals in the health 
care workforce, the registration of pharmacy technicians is warranted and appropriate 
for the level of responsibility and trust afforded by the public. 
 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify in support of HB 72 HD2.

On the following measure: 
H. B. 72, H.D. 2, RELATING TO PHARMACY 
 
Chair Yamashita and Members of the Committee: 
My name is James Skizewski, Executive Officer of the Board of Pharmacy 
(Board).  The Board will meet on February 27, 2025 and take a position on this 
measure.  For now, the Board offers the following comments. 
 
The purpose of this bill beginning on 1/1/2026 is to: (1) require pharmacy 
technicians to be registered; (2) impose a duty on pharmacists-in-charge to report 
violations conducted by registered pharmacy technicians; and (3) specify that 
supervising registered pharmacists are responsible for the actions of registered 
pharmacy technicians and pharmacy interns. 
 
The Board is supportive of the intent to provide regulation of pharmacy 
technicians. The Board recently formed a permitted interaction group to look at best 
practices for regulating pharmacy technicians. The group noted the need to recognize 
national certifications provided by entities such as the Pharmacy Technician 
Certification Board, while still acknowledging the presence of local technicians who 
have received extensive on the job training.  
The Board agreed that a registration for all technicians may be a prudent initial 
step regarding the regulation of pharmacy technicians.  An expansion to the scope of 
practice to technicians that are nationally certified should also be recognized. The 
expansion should include allowances such as those provided in Act 104 SLH  2024.   
Thank you for the opportunity to testify on this bill.

Dear Chair Yamashita, Vice Chair Takenouchi, and Members of the Committee on 
Finance: 
Walgreens submits this testimony in support of H.B. 72, H.D.2, which requires 
pharmacy technicians to be registered with the state. Walgreen Co. (“Walgreens”) 
operates stores at more than 9,000 locations in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, 
and Puerto Rico.  In Hawaii, Walgreens has 13 stores on the islands of Oahu and Maui. 
Walgreens supports the amendments made in the H.D.1 and H.D.2 to adopt a definition 
of “auxiliary personnel” for personnel such as cashiers whose responsibilities are purely 
clerical in nature, to clarify the specific duties of a pharmacy technician, to clarify 
pharmacist supervision of a technician, to establish the specific functions of a pharmacy 
technician in statute, and to exempt this measure from the requirements for a sunrise 
analysis.  
Pharmacy technicians play an important role in the pharmacy setting by handling a 
range of tasks that allow pharmacists to focus on more complex responsibilities like 
patient consultations and clinical services. For example, pharmacy technicians can 
assist pharmacists with the preparation, dispensing, and managing of patient 
medications. Typically, pharmacy technician tasks include filling prescriptions, labeling 
and packaging medications, managing medication inventory, and performing 
administrative duties such as record-keeping and insurance processing. 
The 2024 Legislature passed Act 104 that allows, in part, pharmacists, pharmacy 
technicians and pharmacy interns the ability to administer immunizations and 
vaccinations to persons three years and older under the direct supervision of a 
pharmacist. This measure builds upon Act 104 to require that pharmacy technicians are 
registered by the state. This important measure will bring a regulatory framework to the 
critical role that pharmacy technicians fill, which Walgreens supports. For these reasons, 
we ask the committee to pass this bill.  
Thank you for the opportunity to submit this testimony.

Testimony in SUPPORT for HB72, HD2: RELATING TO PHARMACY 
 
Dear Chair Yamashita, Vice Chair Takenouchi, and Members of the Finance Committee: 
 
As a rural healthcare provider, access to comprehensive, high-quality healthcare services is our mission at 
Moloka’i Drugs. On behalf of our employees and patients, I am testifying in favor of HB72, HD2, which will 
create necessary regulations for pharmacy technicians in our state.  
 
At Moloka’i Drugs, our pharmacy technicians are essential in workflow management – from data entry, to 
managing inventory, to contacting on-island and off-island doctors, to product dispensing, to giving the 
prescription to the verifying pharmacist, to delivering the patient’s drug at the point-of-sale cash register. 
 
Hawai‘i is the only state in the United States without an active, managed list of practicing pharmacy 
technicians. Beyond enhancing our Moloka’i patients’ safety, this measure will lay the foundation for 
pharmacy technicians in Hawai‘i to expand their scope of practice in the future. Across the country, 
pharmacy technicians are taking on advanced roles, such as administering immunizations and assisting 
with medication management. As of today, our pharmacy technicians administer over 50 percent of our 
immunizations, including COVID, flu, pneumonia, RSV and shingles. 
 
Without regulation, Hawai‘i risks falling behind in providing the best possible care to our communities, 
especially rural communities like Moloka’i with very limited medical resources. With only one airline—which 
was shut down for six days in January 2025—and no ferry, our sick and/or elderly residents have even 
more challenges traveling off-island for medical procedures and services. 
 
HB72, HD2, comes at a reasonable price tag, and even small pharmacies such as Moloka’i Drugs are 
willing to pay for these regulations. On behalf of our 7,000 full-time residents, we ask that you support 
HB72, HD2, and help Hawai’i become the 50th state of fifty to finally align our pharmacy technicians with 
national standards. Our Moloka’i-based pharmacy technicians live full-time on our island and know our 
people. They work hand-in-hand with our licensed pharmacists. Our pharmacy technicians are essential 
healthcare employees and they help keep Moloka’i healthy and thriving. Thank you. 
 
Sincerely,

Aloha House Committee on Finance, 
 
As a licensed Hawai‘i pharmacist, retired Daniel K. Inouye College of Pharmacy faculty and 
member of the East Hawai‘i community, I am writing in strong support of HB72 HD2, 
which beginning 1/1/2026, requires pharmacy technicians to be registered; imposes a 
duty on pharmacists-in-charge to report violations conducted by registered pharmacy 
technicians; specifies that supervising registered pharmacists are responsible for the 
actions of registered pharmacy technicians and pharmacy interns. 
Pharmacy technicians play an essential role in supporting pharmacists and ensuring the 
safe preparation and delivery of medications across our state.  
 
Hawai‘i is the only state in the nation without an active, managed list of practicing 
pharmacy technicians, leaving a significant gap in oversight that can impact patient safety. 
HB72 HD2 aligns with national pharmacy technician regulation standards to strengthen 
pharmacy practice in Hawai‘i. 
 
HB72 serves as the backbone for consistent standards of training and competency across 
the profession. Creation of a pharmacy technician data repository is an essential step 
forward, providing a centralized resource for communicating practice and regulatory 
changes. 
 
Beyond enhancing patient safety, HB72 HD2 lays the foundation for pharmacy technicians 
in Hawai‘i to expand their scope of practice in the future. Across the country, registered 
pharmacy technicians are taking on advanced roles. Without regulation, Hawai‘i cannot 
adopt these changes and risks falling behind in providing the best possible care to our 
communities.  
 
HB72 HD2 represents a prudent investment in the safety, efficiency, and adaptability of 
our pharmacy workforce into the future. 
 
I strongly support HB72 HD2, respectfully ask you to pass it out of committee. 
  
Many thanks for your consideration,

Testimony in SUPPORT of HB72 
 
To the Honorable Chair Yamashita, Vice Chair Takenouchi, and Members of the Committee,  
As a pharmacy technician practicing in Hawai‘i, I strongly support HB72, which aims to establish 
much-needed regulations for pharmacy technicians in our state. Hawai‘i is currently the only 
state in the nation without an active, managed list of practicing pharmacy technicians. This lack 
of oversight poses risks to patient safety and limits our profession’s ability to adapt to evolving 
healthcare needs. Regulation is critical to ensuring that pharmacy technicians meet consistent 
standards, enabling us to perform our duties with the highest level of competency and 
accountability. 
I currently provide services at KTA Pharmacy as a CPhT on Hawaii Island. Duties include 
prescription data entry, fill, final sale, vaccinations, and more. Pharmacy technicians across the 
country are able to become nationally certified and provide additional services. 
HB72 is not only a necessary step toward improving patient safety, but it also lays the 
foundation for pharmacy technicians like myself to expand the services we provide in Hawai‘i. 
As our role grows nationally to include responsibilities such as administering immunizations 
and performing medication management tasks, regulation will ensure that Hawai‘i is positioned 
to follow suit. The modest cost of this initiative is a small investment that will have a significant 
impact on the safety, efficiency, and quality of care I can provide in our communities. 
By creating a data repository, this bill will also provide a vital resource for communicating 
practice and regulatory changes across the workforce, ensuring alignment with both state and 
federal requirements. 
I urge the Committee to support HB72 to bring Hawai‘i in line with national standards and to 
ensure a stronger future for pharmacy technicians and pharmacy practice in Hawai’i

Thursday, February 19, 2025 
Testimony in SUPPORT of HB72 
To the Honorable Chair Yamashita, Vice Chair Takenouchi, and Members of the Committee,,  
My name is Megan Arbles Pharm D., Director of Pharmacy for an independent pharmacy on the Big Island and I 
appreciate the opportunity to submit testimony in support of Senate Bill No. HB72, A Bill to Mandate Pharmacy 
Technician Registration within the DCCA. 
As a pharmacist practicing in Hawai‘i, I strongly support HB72, which seeks to establish critical regulations for pharmacy 
technicians in our state. In my practice, pharmacy technicians are essential in performing the following tasks that are 
critical to the workflow of the pharmacy including processing prescriptions, managing inventory, preparing medications 
assisting with insurance claims, and providing essential support to pharmacists in ensuring patient safety.  By handling 
these key responsibilities pharmacy technicians help streamline operations, allowing pharmacists to focus on clinical 
services such as medication counseling, immunizations, and chronic disease management. 
Hawai‘i is the only state in the nation without an active, managed list of practicing pharmacy technicians, leaving a 
significant gap in oversight that can impact patient safety.  Establishing regulations for pharmacy technicians through 
HB72 will ensure proper training, standardization, and accountability ultimately improving patient care and pharmacy 
efficiency in Hawai’i.  Additionally, the creation of a pharmacy technician data repository is an essential step forward, 
providing a centralized resource for communicating practice and regulatory changes. 
Beyond enhancing patient safety, HB72 will lay the foundation for pharmacy technicians in Hawai‘i to expand their 
scope of practice in the future. Across the country, pharmacy technicians are taking on advanced roles, such as 
administering immunizations and assisting with medication management. Without regulation, Hawai‘i cannot adapt to 
these changes and risks falling behind in providing the best possible care to our communities. This initiative comes at a

Testimony in SUPPORT of HB72 
 
To the Honorable Chair Yamashita, Vice Chair Takenouchi, and Members of the Committee,  
As a registered pharmacist practicing in Hawai‘i, I strongly support HB72, which seeks to establish crucial 
regulations for pharmacy technicians in our state. In my practice, pharmacy technicians are essential in 
performing tasks that are critical to the workflow of the pharmacy but not a pharmacist’s duty. Such 
jobs as preparing refills, documentation in the computer, labeling products, answering telephones, 
interfacing with customers are very important in the outpatient setting.  In my previous position as a 
hospital pharmacy Director, pharmacy technicians filled automated dispensing machines and 
emergency/code carts with medications on  the nursing floors and operating rooms as well as 
compounded oral and intravenous solutions including chemotherapy for cancer patients.  Handling of 
hazardous substances and making sure solutions are free of contamination are important tasks 
pharmacy technicians are trained for and perform daily.  As an employer of pharmacy technicians I 
would feel more confident in my hires knowing they were regulated by the state. 
Hawai‘i is the only state in the nation without an active, managed list of practicing pharmacy 
technicians, leaving a significant gap in oversight that can impact patient safety. Pharmacy technicians 
play an essential role in supporting pharmacists and ensuring the safe preparation and delivery of 
medications and devices, and this initiative will serve as the backbone for consistent standards of 
training and competency across the profession. Additionally, the creation of a pharmacy technician data 
repository is an essential step forward, providing a centralized resource for communicating practice and 
regulatory changes. 
Beyond enhancing patient safety, HB72 will lay the foundation for pharmacy technicians in Hawai‘i to 
expand their scope of practice in the future. Across the country, pharmacy technicians are taking on 
advanced roles, such as assisting with clinical data gathering related to medication management. 
Without HB72, Hawai‘I’s pharmacy technicians cannot readily adapt to these changes and risk falling 
behind in providing the best possible care to our communities. This initiative comes at a reasonable cost 
and represents a prudent investment in ensuring the safety, efficiency, and adaptability of our pharmacy 
workforce.  
I urge the Committee to support HB72 and help Hawai‘i align with national pharmacy technician 
regulation standards to strengthen pharmacy practice in our state.

Aloha,  
My name is Beverly Zilonis CPhT-Adv and I fully support HB 72 HD2. I have been a pharmacy 
technician with an advanced pharmacy technician certification since 2006. I started my career in 
the Bay area of Northern California and moved to Hawaii in 2011. In the state of California, 
pharmacy technicians are required to either go to school or take the national exam (PTCB) to get 
licensed in that state including doing a background check that includes fingerprinting. I have had 
the privilege of working in a pharmacy technician registered state and a non-pharmacy 
technician registered State and have seen very clear differences. For almost 14 years I worked for 
Walgreens.I started working for them in California and transferred to their new branch on the 
Big Island of Hawaii. After I transferred, my experience as a senior technician for them changed 
drastically. I was tasked with training the technician staff for the store. Unfortunately, there is no 
requirement for pharmacy technicians in the State of Hawaii. My new technicians had no 
pharmacy background and no prior knowledge of pharmaceuticals. Training in a retail setting is 
already difficult and demanding due to hours and workload, but it was overwhelming to train 
someone that I not only had to teach how to do this job, I had to teach them what a pharmacy 
technician is supposed to know and the sense of responsibility that you should have towards 
patient safety. Many technicians unfortunately here didn't understand the lack of job 
opportunities and the professional recognition from fellow staff. Currently, as Prescription 
Specialist at Hawaii Island Community Health Center the same princples still apply.  Most 
people in the public do not realize how much the pharmacy technicians contribute to patient 
safety and pharmacy compliance. Pharmacists are there to double check us and ensure patient 
safety, but pharmacy technicians are the first line. Pharmacy technicians need to have the tools to 
make the best judgment when they are taking in prescriptions. Pharmacists have a heavy 
workload. Some pharmacies are just one pharmacist on duty and that pharmacist needs to be able 
to count on their technicians. In addition to this legislature HB 72  there is another piece of 
legislation being proposed, SB 324 which mandates reimbursement for services provided by 
participating registered pharmacists practicing within their scope of practice by private and 
public health plans. Having a registry for pharmacy technicians will help ensure not only patient 
safety but that the pharmacists feel supported in knowing they have knowledgeable staff.  
Best Regards, 
Beverly Zilonis CPhT-Adv
