  "overview": "The purpose of this Act is to ensure the payment for debt service for the revenue bonds and the continued availability of resources for the cancer research center of Hawaii's research and operations. This is achieved by increasing the cigarette tax from sixteen cents to eighteen cents and amending the disposition of cigarette tax revenues by allocating the increase in the cigarette tax amount to the Hawaii cancer research special fund. The bill amends the tax rate effective January 1, 2026, and the Act itself has an effective date of December 31, 2050.",
  "appropriations": "This bill amends the disposition of cigarette tax revenues rather than making a direct appropriation. After December 31, 2025, the measure allocates 4.0 cents per cigarette to the Hawaii cancer research special fund for \"research and operating expenses and for capital expenditures.\" Other allocations include 1.125 cents per cigarette, but \"no more than $7,400,000 (HB441_.HTM.txt) in a fiscal year,\" to the trauma system special fund, and 1.25 cents per cigarette, but \"no more than $8,800,000 (HB441_.HTM.txt) in a fiscal year,\" to both the community health centers special fund and the emergency medical services special fund.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal impact is based on the assumption that an increase in the cigarette tax and a reallocation of the resulting revenues will address a financial shortfall. The legislature finds that a \"decline in smoking has resulted in a decrease of over fifty per cent in cigarette tax revenues to the Hawaii cancer research special fund,\" which \"jeopardizes the revenue stream for debt service for the revenue bonds.\" The methodology involves increasing the tax per cigarette from 16.00 to 18.00 cents and directing the additional revenue to the special fund to ensure its solvency.",
  "agency_impact": "The Department of Taxation will be responsible for implementing and collecting the increased excise tax on cigarettes beginning January 1, 2026. The University of Hawaii Cancer Center will see increased funding allocated to the Hawaii cancer research special fund to support its operations and debt service. The Department of Health will continue to administer the trauma system, community health centers, and emergency medical services special funds, with revenues subject to the specified annual caps.",
  "economic_impact": "This Act is intended to ensure the \"continued availability of resources for the cancer research center of Hawaii to deliver cutting-edge cancer treatments to the State's cancer patients.\" By stabilizing the revenue stream for the cancer center, the measure supports its ability to conduct vital research and maintain its status as one of only seventy-two National Cancer Institute-designated cancer centers. The legislature notes that the decline in smoking is a \"public health victory\" but has paradoxically created a financial challenge that this bill seeks to remedy.",
  "policy_impact": "This bill amends Section 245-3 and Section 245-15 of the Hawaii Revised Statutes. It alters state tax policy by increasing the excise tax paid by every wholesaler or dealer for each cigarette sold, used, or possessed. The Act also modifies state fiscal policy by amending the disposition of these revenues, increasing the allocation to the Hawaii cancer research special fund and setting caps on allocations to other health-related special funds.",
  "revenue_sources": "The revenue source is the excise tax on cigarettes and other tobacco products. The bill specifies that \"Every wholesaler or dealer, in addition to any other taxes provided by law, shall pay... an excise tax.\" This measure increases the tax to \"18.00 cents for each cigarette or little cigar sold, used, or possessed by a wholesaler or dealer on and after January 1, 2026.\" All moneys collected are paid into the state treasury as state realizations before being allocated according to the statute.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "Beginning January 1, 2026, this bill increases the excise tax from 16.00 cents to 18.00 cents for each cigarette. The disposition of these revenues will be amended after December 31, 2025. The allocation to the Hawaii cancer research special fund will increase from 2.0 cents to 4.0 cents per cigarette. This additional funding is for research, operating expenses, capital expenditures, and specifically for \"debt service of capital expenditures and building maintenance\" until June 30, 2041. The trauma system special fund is set to receive 1.125 cents per cigarette, but \"no more than $7,400,000 (HB441_.HTM.txt) in a fiscal year.\" The community health centers special fund will receive 1.25 cents per cigarette, but \"no more than $8,800,000 (HB441_.HTM.txt) in a fiscal year.\" Similarly, the emergency medical services special fund will receive 1.25 cents per cigarette, capped at \"no more than $8,800,000 (HB441_.HTM.txt) in a fiscal year.\" These changes are designed to provide a stable, long-term revenue stream for the cancer research fund over the next six years and beyond. The department is required to provide an annual accounting of these dispositions to the legislature.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The measure is expected to increase state operating revenues from the cigarette tax effective January 1, 2026. The tax increase from 16.00 to 18.00 cents per cigarette will generate additional revenue for the state. These increased funds are specifically allocated to the Hawaii cancer research special fund to address a significant decline in its revenues.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The bill provides direct funding for capital expenditures related to the University of Hawaii Cancer Center. Revenue deposited into the Hawaii cancer research special fund is designated for \"research and operating expenses and for capital expenditures.\" Furthermore, from January 1, 2026, until June 30, 2041, a portion of the allocation \"shall be used exclusively for debt service of capital expenditures and building maintenance.\"",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The fiscal implications of this bill are ongoing and will continue after the initial six-year period. The cigarette tax rate of 18.00 cents per cigarette and the new revenue disposition formula are permanent changes effective January 1, 2026. The Hawaii cancer research special fund will continue to receive 4.0 cents per cigarette, while the trauma system, community health centers, and emergency medical services special funds will continue to receive their allocations up to their respective annual caps of $7,400,000 (HB441_.HTM.txt) and $8,800,000 (HB441_.HTM.txt).",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "No previous fiscal note was provided for comparison."
