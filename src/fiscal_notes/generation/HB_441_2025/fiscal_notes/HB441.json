  "overview": "This bill proposes to increase the state excise tax on cigarettes from sixteen cents to eighteen cents per cigarette, effective January 1, 2026. The primary purpose of this measure is to address a significant decline in cigarette tax revenues that support the University of Hawaii Cancer Center. The additional revenue generated from the tax increase is specifically allocated to the Hawaii cancer research special fund to ensure continued payment for debt service on revenue bonds and to support the center's vital research and operations.",
  "appropriations": "This measure does not contain a direct appropriation of funds from the state's general fund. Instead, it amends the statutory disposition of cigarette tax revenues beginning January 1, 2026. The bill increases the allocation to the Hawaii cancer research special fund from the current 2.0 cents (HB441) per cigarette to 4.0 cents (HB441) per cigarette to be used for research, operating expenses, and capital expenditures.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal impact is calculated based on the statutory increase in the cigarette tax rate and the corresponding reallocation of that revenue as specified in the bill. The methodology assumes that the increased per-cigarette tax allocation of 4.0 cents (HB441) to the Hawaii cancer research special fund will generate sufficient revenue to meet debt service and operational needs, although the bill acknowledges that smoking rates and related tax revenues have been declining. The financial projection relies on applying the new tax and allocation rates to the future volume of cigarette sales.",
  "agency_impact": "The Department of Taxation will be operationally impacted as it will need to administer and collect the higher cigarette tax. The University of Hawaii Cancer Center is the primary beneficiary, as the increased revenue directed to the Hawaii cancer research special fund is intended to stabilize its funding for debt service and operations. Other agencies receiving cigarette tax revenues, such as those managing the trauma system, community health centers, and emergency medical services, will see their funding mechanisms continue under existing annual caps.",
  "economic_impact": "This measure is expected to increase the retail price of cigarettes, which may serve as a deterrent to smoking and potentially contribute to long-term public health cost savings. It aims to provide a stable funding stream for the University of Hawaii Cancer Center, thereby supporting specialized cancer research, patient treatment, and employment. By securing the center's financial footing, the bill helps ensure it can continue to serve the diverse populations of Hawaii and the Pacific.",
  "policy_impact": "This bill amends Hawaii Revised Statutes sections 245-3 and 245-15, modifying state tax law and fiscal policy. It reinforces the established policy of utilizing 'sin taxes' on tobacco products to fund critical public health initiatives, particularly those addressing the direct health consequences of smoking. The measure also represents a policy response to the fiscal paradox where successful anti-smoking campaigns lead to revenue shortfalls for the health programs they are designed to support.",
  "revenue_sources": "The exclusive revenue source for this measure is the state excise tax on cigarettes and little cigars. The bill increases this tax from 16.00 cents (HB441) per cigarette to 18.00 cents (HB441) per cigarette, with the change taking effect on January 1, 2026. All of the revenue from the 2.0 cents (HB441) increase is directed to the Hawaii cancer research special fund.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "Beginning January 1, 2026, which is halfway through fiscal year 2026, the excise tax on cigarettes will increase to 18.00 cents (HB441) per cigarette. For the subsequent fiscal years through FY31, the allocation to the Hawaii cancer research special fund will be 4.0 cents (HB441) per cigarette, doubling its prior allocation. This increased revenue is specifically designated for debt service of capital expenditures and building maintenance until June 30, 2041 (HB441). Revenue distributions to other special funds will continue under their existing statutory formulas and caps. The trauma system special fund is allocated 1.125 cents (HB441) per cigarette up to $7,400,000 (HB441) annually. The community health centers special fund is allocated 1.25 cents (HB441) per cigarette up to $8,800,000 (HB441) annually. The emergency medical services special fund is also allocated 1.25 cents (HB441) per cigarette up to $8,800,000 (HB441) annually. The total fiscal impact will be contingent on the volume of cigarette sales, which the bill notes has declined by over fifty per cent in recent years. Any revenue collected beyond the amounts allocated to these special funds will be deposited into the state's general fund.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "This measure is projected to increase the state's total operating revenue derived from the cigarette tax. The rate increase from 16.00 cents (HB441) to 18.00 cents (HB441) per cigarette will generate additional tax collections. Specifically, operating revenues for the Hawaii cancer research special fund are expected to increase significantly due to its allocation rising from 2.0 cents (HB441) to 4.0 cents (HB441) per cigarette.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The bill does not authorize or fund new capital expenditures. Instead, it provides a dedicated revenue stream to service the debt on existing capital projects, namely the revenue bonds sold for the construction of the University of Hawaii Cancer Center in 2010. The funds are also explicitly designated for the ongoing costs of building maintenance.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "Beyond the initial six-year period, the fiscal framework established by this bill is intended to be permanent. The cigarette tax rate will remain at 18.00 cents (HB441) per cigarette, and the allocation of 4.0 cents (HB441) per cigarette to the Hawaii cancer research special fund will continue. This provides a long-term, sustainable funding source for the cancer center's debt service and maintenance obligations until at least June 30, 2041 (HB441).",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "No previous fiscal note was provided for comparison."
