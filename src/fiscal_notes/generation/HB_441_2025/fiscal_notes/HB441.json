  "overview": "This measure proposes to increase the excise tax on cigarettes and little cigars from 16.00 cents to 18.00 cents each, effective July 1, 2025. The bill amends the disposition of revenues by directing the entire 2-cent increase to the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund, effectively doubling its allocation from 2.0 to 4.0 cents per cigarette. The primary goal is to counteract declining tax revenues and provide a more stable funding source for the University of Hawaii Cancer Center's research and operations.",
  "appropriations": "This bill does not contain a direct appropriation but instead amends the statutory allocation of future tax revenues. The entirety of the additional revenue generated from the 2-cent per cigarette tax increase is earmarked for deposit into the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund. This funding is intended to support the operational, research, and patient care initiatives of the University of Hawaii Cancer Center.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal projections are based on historical cigarette tax collection data, which indicates a revenue decline from over $116 million in FY 2016 to approximately $70 million in FY 2024 due to reduced smoking. It is assumed that while cigarette sales volume will continue to decrease, partly accelerated by the price increase, the higher 18-cent tax rate will generate a net positive revenue stream in the short term. The methodology for estimating public health benefits relies on economic models suggesting that a 10% price increase can reduce consumption by 3-5%, thereby generating long-term healthcare savings.",
  "agency_impact": "The Department of Taxation will incur an administrative impact, requiring time and resources to update tax stamps, collection systems, and forms, prompting a request to delay the effective date to January 1, 2026. The Department of the Attorney General anticipates that stabilizing the tax base could indirectly support its Tobacco Enforcement Special Fund, which is vital for maintaining Master Settlement Agreement revenues. The University of Hawaii Cancer Center, as the primary beneficiary, will be responsible for managing the increased allocation to its special fund to support its research and operational mandates.",
  "economic_impact": "The measure is projected to yield long-term economic benefits by reducing smoking-related public health costs, which are estimated at $611 million annually in Hawaii, and mitigating $1.1 billion in lost productivity. Increased funding for the University of Hawaii Cancer Center is also expected to bolster the state's research sector by helping to attract federal grants and retain scientific talent. Conversely, opponents argue the tax is regressive, disproportionately burdening low-income households, and could negatively affect small retailers by decreasing sales and potentially increasing illicit trade.",
  "policy_impact": "This bill modifies existing state law, specifically Hawaii Revised Statutes Chapter 245, by increasing the cigarette tax rate and altering the revenue distribution formula. It reinforces the state's policy of using targeted \"sin taxes\" to fund specific health initiatives, in this case prioritizing cancer research amid declining tobacco consumption. The measure represents a legislative decision to continue leveraging tax policy as a dual tool for influencing public health behavior while generating revenue for programs affected by that same behavior.",
  "revenue_sources": "The exclusive revenue source for this measure is the state's excise tax levied on each cigarette and little cigar sold, used, or possessed by wholesalers or dealers. The funding increase for the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund will be generated directly from the additional 2 cents collected per cigarette. This raises the fund's total allocation to 4 cents per cigarette from this specific tax stream.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The six-year fiscal outlook projects a significant increase in dedicated funding for the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund (HCRSF), though overall state cigarette tax revenues will likely continue their long-term decline. Based on FY 2024 revenue of approximately $70 million, the 2-cent increase is estimated to generate an additional $8 million for the HCRSF in the first full fiscal year, nearly doubling its current allocation from this source. This projection accounts for an initial consumption decline of 3-5% due to the price increase. Over the subsequent five years, annual revenues are expected to decrease by an estimated 3-4% as smoking rates continue their secular decline. Consequently, the additional annual revenue directed to the HCRSF may decrease from over $8 million in FY 2027 to approximately $7 million by FY 2031. No new state positions are created by this measure, as the impact is on revenue allocation. The recurring expenses will be managed by the UH Cancer Center utilizing its increased special fund revenue. A key implication is the reallocation of a larger portion of a declining revenue stream to a specific special fund. This structure makes the HCRSF's budget heavily reliant on a volatile tax source. The Department of Taxation will incur one-time administrative costs in FY 2026 to update its systems and tax stamps for the new rate.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The measure will have an immediate positive impact on the state's total operating revenue by increasing the cigarette tax rate by 12.5%. This is expected to raise total cigarette tax collections in the short term, even with an anticipated decrease in consumption due to price elasticity. However, this revenue gain is not projected to reverse the established long-term downward trend in tobacco tax collections as smoking prevalence continues to decline.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "No direct capital expenditures are anticipated as a result of this bill. The increased revenue is designated for the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund to support the ongoing research, operations, and strategic programs of the University of Hawaii Cancer Center. While this fund has historically supported facility construction, this measure's primary fiscal impact is on operating funds rather than new capital projects.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "After the initial six-year period, the fiscal implications include the permanent collection and allocation of the cigarette tax at the higher 18-cent rate. The revenue stream dedicated to the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund will likely have diminished further, consistent with long-term trends in reduced cigarette consumption. This creates an ongoing fiscal sustainability challenge for the Cancer Center, potentially requiring the exploration of more stable, alternative funding sources in the future to maintain its operational levels.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "No previous fiscal note was provided for comparison."
