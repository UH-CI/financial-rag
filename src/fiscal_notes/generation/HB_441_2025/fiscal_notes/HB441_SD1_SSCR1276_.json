  "overview": "The purpose and intent of this measure is to, beginning January 1, 2026, increase the cigarette tax from sixteen cents to eighteen cents and amend the disposition of cigarette tax revenues by allocating the increase in the cigarette tax amount for debt reduction for the Cancer Research Center of Hawaiʻi (HB441_SD1). The Committees on Health and Human Services and Higher Education find that the last cigarette tax increase in the State was fourteen years ago in 2011 and that this measure increases the excise tax on cigarettes and little cigars as a proven public health policy to prevent youth from starting and incentivize adults to quit smoking (HB441_SD1_SSCR1276_). Your Committees have amended this measure by deleting its contents and inserting the language from S.B. No. 1528, S.D. 1 (2025), a substantively similar measure (HB441_SD1_SSCR1276_).",
  "appropriations": "This measure amends the disposition of cigarette tax revenues by allocating the two-cent increase in the tax to the University of Hawaii for purposes of debt reduction for the Cancer Research Center of Hawaii (HB441_SD1). The disposition of revenues after December 31, 2025, allocates 2.0 cents per cigarette to the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund, and another 2.0 cents per cigarette to the University of Hawaii for debt reduction (HB441_SD1). The measure also sets caps for other funds, including no more than $7,400,000 (HB441_SD1_.HTM.txt) in a fiscal year to be deposited to the credit of the trauma system special fund and no more than $8,800,000 (HB441_SD1_.HTM.txt) in a fiscal year to the community health centers special fund (HB441_SD1).",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The Department of Taxation estimates no material revenue impact to the general fund from this measure (HB441_SD1). The Department estimates a special fund revenue gain based on the proposed increase (HB441_SD1). Projections for a larger, hypothetical $1.00 (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_HHS-HRE_03-19-25_.PDF.txt) per pack increase estimate new annual revenue of $10.84 million (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_HHS-HRE_03-19-25_.PDF.txt) and long-term health care cost savings of $31.80 million (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_HHS-HRE_03-19-25_.PDF.txt) from adult and youth smoking declines (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_HHS-HRE_03-19-25_.PDF.txt).",
  "agency_impact": "The Department of Taxation (DOTAX) can administer the changes in this bill by January 1, 2026 (HB441_SD1). The Department of the Attorney General notes its Tobacco Enforcement Special Fund has experienced a revenue decline from $1.74 million (HB441_SD1) in fiscal year 2015-2016 to $1.03 million (HB441_SD1) in 2023-2024 and needs to recuperate funding (HB441_SD1). The University of Hawai‘i Cancer Center requests an amendment so that additional revenue is deposited directly to the credit of the Hawaiʻi Cancer Research Special Fund rather than to the director of finance (HB441_SD1).",
  "economic_impact": "The annual estimated health care costs directly caused by smoking in Hawaii is $611 million (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_HHS-HRE_03-19-25_.PDF.txt). Smoking-caused government expenditures result in a tax burden of $955.00 (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_HHS-HRE_03-19-25_.PDF.txt) per household and $1.1 billion (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_HHS-HRE_03-19-25_.PDF.txt) in lost productivity in Hawaii (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_HHS-HRE_03-19-25_.PDF.txt). Cigarette tax stamp revenues have plummeted, from over $116 million (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_HHS-HRE_03-19-25_.PDF.txt) in fiscal year 2015-2016 to just over $70 million (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_HHS-HRE_03-19-25_.PDF.txt) in fiscal year 2023-2024 (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_HHS-HRE_03-19-25_.PDF.txt).",
  "policy_impact": "Your Committees on Health and Human Services and Higher Education have amended this measure by deleting its contents and inserting the language from S.B. No. 1528, S.D. 1 (2025), a substantively similar measure (HB441_SD1_SSCR1276_). The measure now increases the cigarette tax from sixteen cents to eighteen cents, beginning January 1, 2026 (HB441_SD1_SSCR1276_). The amended bill is recommended to pass Second Reading and be referred to the Committee on Ways and Means (HB441_SD1_SSCR1276_).",
  "revenue_sources": "The Department of Taxation estimates no material revenue impact to the general fund but projects a special fund revenue gain from the tax increase (HB441_SD1). The Department of the Attorney General provided a chart demonstrating the flow of cigarette and tobacco tax and license money, based on the current taxing scheme, showing total cigarette revenue of $70,092,426 (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_HHS-HRE_03-19-25_.PDF.txt) for FY24 (HB441_SD1). Other FY24 revenues include $2,106,800 (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_HHS-HRE_03-19-25_.PDF.txt) from large cigars and $12,083,794 (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_HHS-HRE_03-19-25_.PDF.txt) from ESDs & e-liquids (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_HHS-HRE_03-19-25_.PDF.txt).",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The Department of Taxation estimates a special fund revenue gain from this measure over the next six fiscal years. For FY 2026 (11 months), the estimated gain is $4.7 (HB441_SD1) million. The projected gains for subsequent fiscal years are as follows: $4.8 (HB441_SD1) million for FY 2027, $4.5 (HB441_SD1) million for FY 2028, $4.3 (HB441_SD1) million for FY 2029, $4.0 (HB441_SD1) million for FY 2030, and $3.8 (HB441_SD1) million for FY 2031 (HB441_SD1).",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The Department of Taxation estimates a special fund revenue gain of $4.7 (HB441_SD1) million in FY 2026 and $4.8 (HB441_SD1) million in FY 2027 (HB441_SD1). There is no material revenue impact estimated for the general fund (HB441_SD1). The revenue gain for special funds is projected to decline annually after FY 2027 (HB441_SD1).",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The amended bill allocates a 2.0 cents per cigarette tax to be deposited with the Director of Finance for the University of Hawaii for the purposes of debt reduction for the Cancer Research Center of Hawaii (HB441_SD1). The Department of the Attorney General and the University of Hawaiʻi Cancer Center recommend amending the bill so that 4.0 cents per cigarette shall be deposited to the credit of the Hawaii cancer research special fund for research and operating expenses and for capital expenditures, with 2.0 cents per cigarette used exclusively for debt service of capital expenditures (HB441_SD1).",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The Department of Taxation's revenue projections show a declining trend in the special fund revenue gain after FY 2027, from $4.8 (HB441_SD1) million to $3.8 (HB441_SD1) million by FY 2031 (HB441_SD1). Testimony from the Retail Merchants of Hawaii states that an increase in the cigarette tax is an unstable revenue source, creating long-term financial uncertainty for the Hawaiʻi Cancer Research Special Fund (HB441_SD1). This suggests that reliance on this revenue stream for ongoing programs may not be sustainable.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The bill has been substantively amended, with its contents replaced by language from S.B. No. 1528, S.D. 1 (HB441_SD1_SSCR1276_). The tax increase is now specified to be from sixteen cents to eighteen cents per cigarette, effective January 1, 2026, a change from the previous version's July 1, 2025 effective date and unspecified amount (HB441_SD1_SSCR1276_). A major change is the allocation of the revenue increase, which is now directed to the Director of Finance to be payable to the University of Hawaii for debt reduction for the Cancer Research Center of Hawaii (HB441_SD1_SSCR1276_). The Department of Taxation has provided new, specific six-year revenue projections, estimating a special fund gain of $4.7 (HB441_SD1) million in FY2026, peaking at $4.8 (HB441_SD1) million in FY2027, and declining thereafter, with no material impact on the general fund (HB441_SD1)."
