  "overview": "The purpose of this Act is to ensure the payment for debt service for the revenue bonds and the continued availability of resources for the cancer research center of Hawaii's research and operations. [11] [11] This is done by increasing the cigarette tax from sixteen cents to eighteen cents and amending the disposition of cigarette tax revenues by allocating the increase in the cigarette tax amount for debt reduction for the Cancer Research Center of Hawaii. [11] [11] Beginning January 1, 2026, the bill increases the cigarette tax and amends the disposition of revenues by allocating the increase in the cigarette tax amount to the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund. [12] [12]",
  "appropriations": "This bill increases the cigarette tax from sixteen cents to eighteen cents. [11] The bill amends the disposition of cigarette tax revenues by allocating the increase in the cigarette tax amount to be deposited with the Director of Finance to be payable to the University of Hawaii for the purposes of debt reduction for the Cancer Research Center of Hawaii. [12] [12] After December 31, 2025, the disposition of revenues includes 2.0 cents per cigarette to be deposited with the director of finance for debt reduction for the cancer research center of Hawaii. [11] [11]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The legislature finds that a decline in smoking has resulted in a decrease of over fifty per cent in cigarette tax revenues to the Hawaii cancer research special fund. [11] Projections are based on research findings that nationally, each 10% increase in the retail price of cigarettes reduces youth smoking by 6.5%, young adult prevalence by 3.25%, adult prevalence by 2%, and total cigarette consumption by about 4% (adjusted down to account for tax evasion effects). [10] Projections are fiscally conservative because they include a generous adjustment for lost state pack sales from possible new smuggling and tax evasion after the rate increase and from fewer sales to people who smoke or smugglers from other states. [10] [10]",
  "agency_impact": "The Department of Taxation (DOTAX) requests that the effective date of the tax increase be amended to January 1, 2026, to provide sufficient time for DOTAX to update stamps and implement the system and form changes necessary for the proposed increase. [10] The Department of the Attorney General's Tobacco Enforcement Special Fund (Fund) has experienced a revenue decline due to reduced cigarettes sales. [10] The revenue deposited into the Fund has dropped from testimony indicates $1.74 million (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_HHS-HRE_03-19-25_.PDF.txt) in fiscal year 2015-2016 to testimony indicates $1.03 million (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_HHS-HRE_03-19-25_.PDF.txt) in 2023-2024. [10] These decisions highlight a critical need for stable funding for the Department to maintain and further its diligent enforcement efforts and reduce the risk of losing MSA revenue. [10]",
