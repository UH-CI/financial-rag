  "overview": "The bill has been amended to specify a tax increase from sixteen cents to eighteen cents per cigarette, effective January 1, 2026 (HB441_SD1_SSCR1276_). The committee report states the purpose of this increase is to amend the disposition of cigarette tax revenues by allocating the new funds for debt reduction for the Cancer Research Center of Hawaii (HB441_SD1_SSCR1276_). Testimony from the Department of Health and other advocacy groups continues to recommend a larger increase of 5.00 cents per cigarette to maximize public health benefits (HB441_SD1).",
  "appropriations": "Testimony from the Department of Taxation provides a new, specific forecast for the proposed 18-cent tax, estimating a special fund revenue gain of $4.7 million (HB441_SD1) in fiscal year 2026 and $4.8 million (HB441_SD1) in fiscal year 2027. Both the Attorney General and the University of Hawaii submitted testimony recommending an amendment to increase the total allocation to the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund to 4.0 cents per cigarette (HB441_SD1). Of that amount, their testimony recommends 2.0 cents per cigarette (HB441_SD1) be used exclusively for debt service of capital expenditures.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The Department of Taxation has provided new revenue projections based on the bill's specific tax increase to eighteen cents per cigarette, replacing previous estimates that were based on a hypothetical $1.00 per pack increase. The department's testimony projects a special fund revenue gain of $4.7 million (HB441_SD1) in fiscal year 2026, with this gain decreasing in subsequent years. The specific data sources and cost estimation methods used for this new projection were not detailed in the provided testimony.",
  "agency_impact": "In new testimony, the Department of the Attorney General and the University of Hawaii have raised concerns about the amended bill's language, noting it creates ambiguity by directing funds to the Director of Finance rather than a specific fund (HB441_SD1). Both agencies recommend amending the bill to deposit the increased revenue directly into the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund to ensure clarity and proper allocation. The Department of Taxation confirms it can administer the changes by the proposed January 1, 2026 effective date (HB441_SD1).",
  "economic_impact": "",
  "policy_impact": "The Senate Committees on Health and Human Services and Higher Education have amended the measure, replacing the previously unspecified tax rate with a specific increase to eighteen cents per cigarette effective January 1, 2026 (HB441_SD1_SSCR1276_). This amendment solidifies the bill's fiscal details, which were previously left open-ended. The new language also specifies that the increased revenue is to be used for debt reduction for the Cancer Research Center of Hawaii (HB441_SD1_SSCR1276_).",
  "revenue_sources": "New testimony from the Department of Taxation provides an official multi-year forecast for revenue gains resulting from the proposed 18-cent tax. The department estimates the increase will generate new special fund revenue of $4.7 million (HB441_SD1) in FY2026, $4.8 million (HB441_SD1) in FY2027, and $4.5 million (HB441_SD1) in FY2028. Projections show this new revenue stream will decline annually thereafter.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The Department of Taxation has submitted a new six-year fiscal forecast specific to the proposed 18-cent per cigarette tax increase, replacing prior estimates that were based on a different tax model. The department estimates a special fund revenue gain of $4.7 million (HB441_SD1) for the eleven months of fiscal year 2026. For subsequent full fiscal years, the projected gains are $4.8 million (HB441_SD1) in FY2027, $4.5 million (HB441_SD1) in FY2028, $4.3 million (HB441_SD1) in FY2029, $4.0 million (HB441_SD1) in FY2030, and $3.8 million (HB441_SD1) in FY2031. The department's testimony indicates no material impact is expected for the general fund (HB441_SD1).",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "Based on the specific 18-cent tax rate now in the bill, the Department of Taxation has provided a new projection that estimates an increase in special fund revenue of $4.7 million (HB441_SD1) in fiscal year 2026. This is followed by a projected increase of $4.8 million (HB441_SD1) in fiscal year 2027. The department testimony states there will be no material revenue impact to the general fund (HB441_SD1).",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The new six-year forecast from the Department of Taxation provides more concrete data supporting long-term sustainability concerns, showing a projected decline in annual revenue gain from a peak of $4.8 million (HB441_SD1) in FY2027 to $3.8 million (HB441_SD1) by FY2031. This trend suggests that while the tax increase provides an initial revenue boost, the funds generated for the designated special fund will diminish over time. This reinforces previous testimony about the volatility of relying on a shrinking tax base for ongoing funding needs.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The bill has been significantly amended, replacing the unspecified tax rate with a specific increase to eighteen cents per cigarette effective January 1, 2026 (HB441_SD1_SSCR1276_). Consequently, the Department of Taxation has provided the first official six-year fiscal forecast for this rate, projecting a special fund revenue gain of $4.7 million (HB441_SD1) in FY2026 and specifying no material impact to the general fund. The purpose of the new revenue has been narrowed to debt reduction for the Cancer Research Center of Hawaii (HB441_SD1_SSCR1276_). New testimony from the Attorney General and the University of Hawaii identifies and seeks to correct ambiguity in the new revenue allocation language (HB441_SD1)."
