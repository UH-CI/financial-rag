  "overview": "This measure has been substantially amended to specify an increase in the cigarette tax from sixteen cents to eighteen cents per cigarette, effective January 1, 2026 (HB441_SD1_SSCR1276_). The key component of this version is the specific allocation of the new two-cent tax revenue. The funds are to be deposited with the Director of Finance and made payable to the University of Hawaii for the explicit purpose of debt reduction for the Cancer Research Center of Hawaii (HB441_SD1_SSCR1276_).",
  "appropriations": "The bill now specifies the disposition of the new tax revenue, allocating 2.0 cents per cigarette to the University of Hawaii for debt reduction for the Cancer Research Center of Hawaii (HB441_SD1_TESTIMONY_DOTAX_03-31-25). Testimony from the Department of Taxation clarifies the full amended distribution structure effective after December 31, 2025. This includes capping the Trauma System Special Fund at the lesser of 1.125 cents per cigarette or $7,400,000 (HB441_SD1_TESTIMONY_DOTAX_03-31-25), and the Community Health Centers and Emergency Medical Services special funds at the lesser of 1.25 cents per cigarette or $8,800,000 (HB441_SD1_TESTIMONY_DOTAX_03-31-25) each.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The Department of Taxation has provided official financial projections based on the specified two-cent tax increase per cigarette. These estimates calculate the revenue impact on special funds for a six-year period. The methodology assumes the tax increase takes effect on January 1, 2026, and accounts for the expected continued decline in cigarette sales over the projection period (HB441_SD1_TESTIMONY_DOTAX_03-31-25).",

  "policy_impact": "The measure has been amended into S.D. 1, replacing the previous version's unspecified amounts with a defined tax increase from sixteen cents to eighteen cents per cigarette (HB441_SD1_SSCR1276_). This amendment solidifies the bill's fiscal policy by directing the two-cent per cigarette increase specifically toward debt reduction for the Cancer Research Center of Hawaii (HB441_SD1_SSCR1276_). The effective date for the tax increase has been set to January 1, 2026, providing a clear timeline for implementation (HB441_SD1_SSCR1276_).",
  "revenue_sources": "The Department of Taxation testimony estimates the two-cent tax increase will generate new special fund revenue of $4.7 million (HB441_SD1_TESTIMONY_DOTAX_03-31-25) in fiscal year 2026. The new revenue is projected to peak at $4.8 million (HB441_SD1_TESTIMONY_DOTAX_03-31-25) in fiscal year 2027 before declining in subsequent years. Testimony also indicates no material revenue impact is expected for the general fund (HB441_SD1_TESTIMONY_DOTAX_03-31-25).",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The Department of Taxation has provided a six-year fiscal forecast for the newly specified two-cent per cigarette tax increase, which is effective January 1, 2026 (HB441_SD1_TESTIMONY_DOTAX_03-31-25). The department estimates a special fund revenue gain of $4.7 million (HB441_SD1_TESTIMONY_DOTAX_03-31-25) for the 11 months of fiscal year 2026. For subsequent full fiscal years, the projected revenue gain is $4.8 million (HB441_SD1_TESTIMONY_DOTAX_03-31-25) in FY 2027, $4.5 million (HB441_SD1_TESTIMONY_DOTAX_03-31-25) in FY 2028, and $4.3 million (HB441_SD1_TESTIMONY_DOTAX_03-31-25) in FY 2029. The revenue gains are projected to continue declining, with gains of $4.0 million (HB441_SD1_TESTIMONY_DOTAX_03-31-25) in FY 2030 and $3.8 million (HB441_SD1_TESTIMONY_DOTAX_03-31-25) in FY 2031. These projections are based on the assumption of a continued decline in cigarette sales. The bill still contains a defective effective date of December 31, 2050 (HB441_SD1_TESTIMONY_DOTAX_03-31-25).",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The Department of Taxation testimony projects a direct increase in special fund operating revenues as a result of the measure. The estimated gain is $4.7 million (HB441_SD1_TESTIMONY_DOTAX_03-31-25) in fiscal year 2026 and $4.8 million (HB441_SD1_TESTIMONY_DOTAX_03-31-25) in fiscal year 2027. The testimony explicitly states there will be no material revenue impact to the general fund (HB441_SD1_TESTIMONY_DOTAX_03-31-25).",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "Based on the Department of Taxation's six-year forecast, the revenue generated from the tax increase will be on a downward trend, falling to $3.8 million (HB441_SD1_TESTIMONY_DOTAX_03-31-25) by fiscal year 2031. This trend indicates that the annual fiscal impact will continue to decrease after the initial six-year period. The sustainability of this revenue for long-term debt service will depend on the rate of decline in cigarette consumption.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The bill has been significantly amended into S.D. 1, which specifies a cigarette tax increase from sixteen cents to eighteen cents per cigarette effective January 1, 2026 (HB441_SD1_SSCR1276_). The previous version's unspecified amounts have been replaced with a clear directive allocating the two-cent increase for debt reduction for the Cancer Research Center of Hawaii (HB441_SD1_SSCR1276_). The Department of Taxation has now provided an official six-year fiscal forecast for this specific tax increase, estimating a special fund revenue gain of $4.7 million (HB441_SD1_TESTIMONY_DOTAX_03-31-25) in FY 2026 and declining amounts in subsequent years."
