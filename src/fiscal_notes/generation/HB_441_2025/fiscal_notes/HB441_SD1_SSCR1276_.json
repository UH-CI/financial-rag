  "overview": "The bill has been amended to become H.B. No. 441, S.D. 1, which now specifies a cigarette tax increase from sixteen to eighteen cents per cigarette, effective January 1, 2026. The new version replaces the previous draft's unspecified amounts and defective effective date. It also directs the resulting revenue to the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund for the specific purpose of debt reduction for the Cancer Research Center of Hawaii.",
  "appropriations": "The measure now formally proposes a 2-cent increase per cigarette (from 16 to 18 cents), effective January 1, 2026. The additional revenue is specifically allocated to the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund. A new provision directs these funds to be used for debt reduction for the University of Hawaii's Cancer Research Center.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The basis for fiscal projections has changed from a hypothetical $1.00 per pack increase to the formally adopted 2-cent per cigarette ($0.40 per pack) increase. Consequently, all revenue and economic impact estimates must be recalculated based on this smaller, specific tax hike. The effective date of January 1, 2026, means the fiscal impact will begin in the second half of fiscal year 2026.",
  "agency_impact": "The bill's new effective date of January 1, 2026, directly accommodates the implementation timeline previously requested by the Department of Taxation. The University of Hawai ªi Cancer Center is now set to receive the funds specifically for debt reduction on its facility. This provides a more targeted use for the revenue compared to general research support.",
  "economic_impact": "The expected economic effects, including long-term healthcare savings and potential revenue from the tax, will be smaller than previously projected due to the reduced tax increase amount of $0.40 per pack instead of $1.00. Arguments from opponents regarding the tax's regressive nature and potential to encourage illicit markets remain, though the financial incentive for such activities is lessened with a smaller tax hike. No new quantitative impact studies were provided for the 40-cent increase.",
  "policy_impact": "The measure's policy has been solidified by replacing its contents with the language from S.B. No. 1528, S.D. 1. This introduces a significant new policy goal: directing the additional revenue specifically toward debt reduction for the Cancer Research Center. This shifts the focus from broadly funding new research to servicing existing financial obligations for the Center's infrastructure.",
  "revenue_sources": "While the revenue source remains the cigarette excise tax, the use of the increased funds is now more narrowly defined. The revenue generated from the 2-cent per cigarette tax increase is specifically earmarked for payment to the University of Hawaii. This is for the purpose of debt reduction for the Cancer Research Center of Hawaii.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The fiscal outlook is now based on a 2-cent per cigarette ($0.40 per pack) increase beginning midway through FY2026, which will generate substantially less new revenue than the previously estimated $10.84 million annually. The primary use of this new, smaller revenue stream over the next six years will be to service the debt on the Cancer Research Center. This provides a dedicated funding source for an existing liability but offers less flexible funding for new programmatic or research initiatives.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The anticipated increase in state operating revenue is now based on a 2-cent per cigarette tax hike, which is significantly lower than the previously discussed $1.00 per pack increase. As a result, the projected new revenue will be substantially less than the $10.84 million figure cited in earlier testimony. The impact will begin halfway through fiscal year 2026.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The measure has been amended to specify that the new revenue is to be used for debt reduction for the Cancer Research Center of Hawaii. This does not involve new capital spending but rather allocates funds to service the debt associated with a past capital project. This clarifies that the funds are for an existing liability, not new construction.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The bill has been substantially amended and is now designated H.B. No. 441, S.D. 1. Key changes include: the tax increase has been set at a specific rate, rising from 16 to 18 cents per cigarette; the effective date is now January 1, 2026, aligning with the Department of Taxation's request; and the new revenue is explicitly allocated for debt reduction for the University of Hawaii Cancer Research Center. The previous unspecified amounts and defective effective date have been replaced with the language from a similar measure, S.B. No. 1528, S.D. 1."
