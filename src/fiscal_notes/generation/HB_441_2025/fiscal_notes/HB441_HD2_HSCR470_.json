  "overview": "This measure has been amended to make the proposed cigarette tax rate and the disposition of revenues unspecified, effectively 'blanking out' the specific monetary amounts. The bill's core purpose remains to increase the cigarette tax after July 1, 2025, and allocate additional revenue to the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund. It retains a defective effective date of July 1, 3000, to encourage further discussion and amendment by the next committee.",

  "policy_impact": "The bill's policy has been updated to serve as a legislative vehicle, deferring the decision on the specific tax rate and allocations to the Committee on Finance. The House Committee on Higher Education's report formally requests that the Finance Committee consider establishing a tax of 18.00 cents per cigarette. This would include an allocation of 4.0 cents to the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund.",

  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The primary update is the amendment of the bill to remove specific figures for the tax increase and revenue allocations, replacing them with unspecified amounts. While the bill text is now 'blank,' the accompanying report from the House Committee on Higher Education recommends that the Committee on Finance consider inserting a tax rate of 18.00 cents per cigarette, with 4.0 cents allocated to the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund. The measure has passed the Committee on Higher Education and been referred to the Committee on Finance, retaining its defective effective date of July 1, 3000, and therefore has no current fiscal impact."
