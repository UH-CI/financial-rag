  "overview": "The purpose of this measure is to increase the cigarette tax beginning July 1, 2025, and allocate the increase in the cigarette tax amount to be deposited into the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund. [7] Your Committee on Higher Education has amended this measure by changing the cigarette tax amount and dispositions of the cigarette tax revenue to unspecified amounts. [7] The amended version is H.B. No. 441, H.D. 2, and the effective date remains July 1, 3000. [7] [6]",
  "appropriations": "The Committee on Higher Education has requested that the Committee on Finance consider depositing 4.0 cents per cigarette to the credit of the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund. [7] It also requested considering deposits of 1.125 cents per cigarette, but no more than $7,400,000 (HB441_HD2_HSCR470_.htm.txt) in a fiscal year, to the Trauma System Special Fund. [7] Further requests include depositing 1.25 cents per cigarette, up to $8,800,000 (HB441_HD2_HSCR470_.htm.txt) annually, to both the Community Health Centers Special Fund and the Emergency Medical Services Special Fund. [7] [7]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "Projections for a tax increase are based on research findings that nationally, each 10% increase in the retail price of cigarettes reduces youth smoking by 6.5%, young adult prevalence by 3.25%, and adult prevalence by 2%. [5] The projections are fiscally conservative because they include a generous adjustment for lost state pack sales from possible new smuggling and tax evasion after the rate increase. [5] The economic model used was developed jointly by Economics for Health, the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, and the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network. [5]",
  "agency_impact": "The Department of the Attorney General's testimony highlights that recent arbitration decisions found Washington, Missouri, and New Mexico non-diligent in MSA enforcement, jeopardizing their annual MSA payments. [5] These decisions highlight a critical need for stable funding for the Department to maintain and further its diligent enforcement efforts and reduce the risk of losing MSA revenue. [5] The Department recognizes that continued reliance on declining cigarette tax revenue is unsustainable. [5]",
  "economic_impact": "One projected outcome with a $1.00 (HB441_HD1_TESTIMONY_HED_02-07-25_.PDF.txt) increase in the cost of a pack of cigarettes would result in approximately 2,000 adults in our state quitting smoking. [5] The same increase would result in a projected 7.4% decrease in youth (under 18) smoking, and 100 young adults (18-24) would quit smoking. [5] In contrast, opposing testimony argues that disproportionate increases in the SET often reduce, rather than increase, tax revenue, while placing additional fiscal strain on the state. [5]",
  "policy_impact": "The Committee on Higher Education amended H.B. No. 441, H.D. 1, resulting in H.B. No. 441, H.D. 2. [7] The primary amendment was changing the cigarette tax amount and dispositions of the cigarette tax revenue to unspecified amounts to encourage further discussion. [7] The Committee on Higher Education respectfully requests the Committee on Finance to consider establishing a tax rate of 18.00 cents for each cigarette or little cigar sold on and after July 1, 2025. [7] [7]",
  "revenue_sources": "In addition to previously reported revenues, testimony provides a more detailed breakdown of FY24 revenues from the cigarette and tobacco tax. [5] This includes $4,841,298 (HB441_HD1_TESTIMONY_HED_02-07-25_.PDF.txt) for the Trauma System Special Fund and revenues from large cigars totaling $2,106,800 (HB441_HD1_TESTIMONY_HED_02-07-25_.PDF.txt). [5] [5] Other specified revenues include $60,590 (HB441_HD1_TESTIMONY_HED_02-07-25_.PDF.txt) from retail permits and $48,280 (HB441_HD1_TESTIMONY_HED_02-07-25_.PDF.txt) from license fees. [5] [5]",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "Because H.B. 441, H.D. 2 has an effective date of July 1, 3000, projections are based on testimony supporting an amended, functional date and a hypothetical tax increase. [6] A $1.00 (HB441_HD1_TESTIMONY_HED_02-07-25_.PDF.txt) per pack increase is projected to generate $10.84 million (HB441_HD1_TESTIMONY_HED_02-07-25_.PDF.txt) in new annual revenue in its first year. [5] This increase is estimated to result in 2,000 current adults who smoke quitting and 500 premature smoking-caused deaths being prevented. [5] Over a 5-year period, this would lead to health care cost savings of $360,000 (HB441_HD1_TESTIMONY_HED_02-07-25_.PDF.txt) from fewer lung cancer cases and $190,000 (HB441_HD1_TESTIMONY_HED_02-07-25_.PDF.txt) from fewer smoking-affected pregnancies. [5] [5] Further 5-year savings include $220,000 (HB441_HD1_TESTIMONY_HED_02-07-25_.PDF.txt) from fewer heart attacks and strokes and $990,000 (HB441_HD1_TESTIMONY_HED_02-07-25_.PDF.txt) in Medicaid program savings. [5] Significant tax increases generate new revenues because the higher tax rate per pack brings in more new revenue than is lost from the tax-related drop in total pack sales. [5] However, ongoing reductions in state smoking rates will, over time, gradually erode state cigarette tax revenues in the absence of new rate increases. [5] These declines are considered more predictable and less volatile than other state revenue sources, such as income or corporate taxes. [5] The smoking declines that reduce tobacco tax revenues will simultaneously produce much larger reductions in government and private sector smoking-caused health care and other costs over time. [5]",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "Testimony in opposition to the measure suggests that disproportionate increases in the state excise tax often reduce, rather than increase, tax revenue over the long term. [5] It is argued that a tax increase to $4.20 (HB441_HD1_TESTIMONY_HED_02-07-25_.PDF.txt) would provide only a temporary boost in cigarette tax revenue, while imposing lasting harm on tax-paying businesses. [5] Opposing testimony also warns that excessive increases can lead to a decline in legal sales, ultimately reducing state tax collections as consumers shift to non-taxed sources. [5]",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The measure amends section 245-15, Hawaii Revised Statutes, to specify that a portion of cigarette tax revenue shall be deposited to the credit of the Hawaii cancer research special fund for research and operating expenses and for capital expenditures. [6] The Committee on Higher Education has requested that the Committee on Finance consider depositing 4.0 cents per cigarette into this fund for these purposes. [7]",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The bill's defective effective date of July 1, 3000, complicates long-term fiscal projections. [6] Testimony from the Department of the Attorney General states that continued reliance on declining cigarette tax revenue is unsustainable for funding state programs. [5] Other testimony notes that ongoing reductions in state smoking rates will, over time, gradually erode state cigarette tax revenues, absent any new rate increases. [5]",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The bill was amended by the Committee on Higher Education, resulting in H.B. 441, H.D. 2. [7] The amendment changed the cigarette tax amount and the dispositions of the cigarette tax revenue to unspecified amounts to facilitate further discussion. [7] The Committee on Higher Education made specific requests to the Committee on Finance to consider setting the tax rate at 18.00 cents per cigarette and establishing specific caps for distributions to various special funds, such as no more than $7,400,000 (HB441_HD2_HSCR470_.htm.txt) for the Trauma System Special Fund. [7] [7] New testimony from the Attorney General specified that other states like Washington, Missouri, and New Mexico have recently been found non-diligent in MSA enforcement, increasing the risk to Hawaii's MSA payments. [5] More detailed FY24 revenue figures were provided, including amounts for the Trauma System Special Fund ($4,841,298 (HB441_HD1_TESTIMONY_HED_02-07-25_.PDF.txt)), large cigars ($2,106,800 (HB441_HD1_TESTIMONY_HED_02-07-25_.PDF.txt)), retail permits ($60,590 (HB441_HD1_TESTIMONY_HED_02-07-25_.PDF.txt)), and license fees ($48,280 (HB441_HD1_TESTIMONY_HED_02-07-25_.PDF.txt)). [5] [5] [5] Testimony in opposition was received, arguing that large tax increases encourage black market sales and can lead to a long-term reduction in state tax collections. [5]"
