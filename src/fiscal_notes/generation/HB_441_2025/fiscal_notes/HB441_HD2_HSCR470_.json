  "overview": "This measure now proposes an unspecified increase to the cigarette tax, with the additional revenue to be allocated to the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund, effective July 1, 3000 (HB441_HD2). The House Committee on Higher Education amended the bill to remove specific fiscal amounts, deferring these details to the Committee on Finance for further deliberation (HB441_HD2_HSCR470_). The committee report recommends that the tax rate be established at 18.00 cents per cigarette, with 4.0 cents per cigarette allocated to the cancer fund (HB441_HD2_HSCR470_).",
  "appropriations": "No direct appropriation is made in the current version of the bill, as HB441 HD2 removes specific allocation amounts and leaves them blank for future determination (HB441_HD2). The accompanying committee report recommends that 4.0 cents per cigarette be deposited into the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund (HB441_HD2_HSCR470_). The report also suggests maintaining existing annual caps on other funds, such as $7,400,000 (HB441_HD2_HSCR470_) for the Trauma System Special Fund.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "Fiscal assumptions are now contingent on future amendments, as the bill's tax rate and allocation amounts are unspecified (HB441_HD2). The House Committee on Higher Education's recommendation is based on an increase from the current 16.00 cents to a proposed 18.00 cents per cigarette, with the additional 2.0 cents directed to the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund (HB441_HD2_HSCR470_). For implementation, the Department of Taxation has requested an effective date of January 1, 2026, to allow sufficient time for updating systems and tax stamps (HB441_HD1_TESTIMONY_HED_02-07-25_).",
  "agency_impact": "The Department of Taxation testified that a change in the tax rate would require time to update tax stamps and implement necessary system and form changes. The department formally requested an effective date of January 1, 2026, to accommodate these administrative requirements (HB441_HD1_TESTIMONY_HED_02-07-25_). This represents a new operational consideration for the implementing agency.",
  "economic_impact": "",
  "policy_impact": "The measure has been substantially amended into House Draft 2, which removes the specific tax rate increase and revenue disposition amounts, leaving them blank (HB441_HD2). This procedural change delegates the responsibility for determining the bill's fiscal details to the next legislative committee. The bill retains the defective effective date of July 1, 3000, which continues to postpone any policy implementation indefinitely (HB441_HD2).",
  "revenue_sources": "The revenue source remains the state excise tax on cigarettes, but the rate of the proposed increase is now unspecified in the bill (HB441_HD2). The House Committee on Higher Education's report recommends setting the new rate at 18.00 cents per cigarette and allocating 4.0 cents per cigarette to the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund (HB441_HD2_HSCR470_). Other special fund allocations are recommended to continue with their existing fiscal year caps, such as no more than $8,800,000 (HB441_HD2_HSCR470_) for the community health centers special fund and no more than $8,800,000 (HB441_HD2_HSCR470_) for the emergency medical services special fund.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The bill's effective date of July 1, 3000 (HB441_HD2) ensures there are no fiscal implications within the six-year outlook. Furthermore, the current draft of the bill contains no specific tax rate or allocation amounts, making any fiscal projection impossible without subsequent amendments (HB441_HD2_HSCR470_). The House Committee on Higher Education has recommended that the Finance Committee consider inserting a tax rate of 18.00 cents per cigarette and an allocation of 4.0 cents per cigarette to the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund (HB441_HD2_HSCR470_). The committee also reaffirmed the annual caps on deposits to other special funds, including up to $7,400,000 (HB441_HD2_HSCR470_) for the Trauma System Special Fund, $8,800,000 (HB441_HD2_HSCR470_) for the Community Health Centers Special Fund, and $8,800,000 (HB441_HD2_HSCR470_) for the Emergency Medical Services Special Fund. Despite these recommendations, the distant effective date precludes any financial impact within the six-year timeframe.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "All fiscal implications are deferred far into the future due to the bill's effective date of July 1, 3000 (HB441_HD2). The removal of specific tax and allocation amounts in House Draft 2 adds further uncertainty, as any long-term fiscal impact is now entirely dependent on future legislative action to both define these figures and amend the effective date (HB441_HD2_HSCR470_).",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The principal change is the amendment of the bill to House Draft 2, which removes the specific tax rate and revenue disposition amounts, leaving them unspecified for the Committee on Finance to determine (HB441_HD2). A new committee report (HB441_HD2_HSCR470_) formally recommends inserting a tax rate of 18.00 cents per cigarette and increasing the allocation to the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund to 4.0 cents per cigarette. Additionally, the Department of Taxation has now formally requested a new effective date of January 1, 2026, to ensure adequate time for implementation (HB441_HD1_TESTIMONY_HED_02-07-25_)."
