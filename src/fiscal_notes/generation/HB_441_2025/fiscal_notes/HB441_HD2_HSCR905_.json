  "overview": "This measure, which proposes an increase to the cigarette tax, has passed the House Committee on Finance and is recommended for Third Reading while still containing unspecified tax rates and allocation amounts (HB441_HD2_HSCR905_). The purpose remains to increase the tax and direct additional revenues to certain special funds, particularly the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund. Testimony from various agencies and organizations reflects a broader discussion on the specific tax rate, with proposals ranging from 18 cents to 21 cents per cigarette.",
  "appropriations": "While the bill itself contains no specific appropriation amounts, new testimony provides a baseline for current funding distributions from cigarette tax revenue in fiscal year 2024. According to testimony from the Department of the Attorney General, the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund received $8,606,752 (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_), the Trauma System Special Fund received $4,841,298 (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_), and the Community Health Centers Special Fund and Emergency Medical Services Special Fund each received $5,379,220 (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_). These figures detail the current fiscal landscape that would be altered by the proposed legislation.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "New fiscal projections have been introduced based on alternative tax increase proposals that are higher than what was previously considered. Testimony from the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network estimates that a $1.00 per pack increase would generate $10.84 million (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_19) in new annual revenue. A separate projection from the Hawaii COPD Coalition suggests a $1.00 per pack increase would raise $11.46 million (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_11) annually. These alternative models provide different methodologies for estimating revenue based on a more significant tax hike.",
  "agency_impact": "The Department of the Attorney General testified that its Tobacco Enforcement Special Fund has experienced a significant revenue decline, falling from $1.74 million (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_) in fiscal year 2015-2016 to $1.03 million (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_) in 2023-2024. This decrease in funding reportedly affects the department's ability to conduct diligent enforcement of the Master Settlement Agreement. The department states it needs to recuperate funding to the special fund to continue its enforcement efforts and reduce the risk of losing MSA revenue.",
  "economic_impact": "Testimony from the Department of Health introduces new data on the economic burden of smoking in the state, estimating annual health care costs at $611 million (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_3). The same testimony indicates a tax burden of $955.00 per household (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_3) and $1.1 billion (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_3) in lost productivity due to smoking. Furthermore, testimony from the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network projects that a $1.00 per pack tax increase could yield long-term health care cost savings of $31.80 million (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_19_1.pdf).",
  "policy_impact": "The measure has advanced from the House Committee on Finance to Third Reading, still in its HD2 form with unspecified tax rates (HB441_HD2_HSCR905_). This procedural step moves the bill forward while deferring the critical decision on the fiscal details. Multiple testimonies have now introduced alternative policy proposals, such as increasing the tax to 19 cents (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_10) or 21 cents per cigarette (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_4), indicating an ongoing legislative debate over the final tax structure.",
  "revenue_sources": "New testimony details the current revenue landscape, indicating total cigarette revenue for fiscal year 2024 was $70,092,426 (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_). After distributions to various special funds, the remaining balance of approximately $58,789,339 (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_) was deposited into the general fund. The Department of the Attorney General testified that overall cigarette tax stamp revenues have plummeted from over $116 million (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_) in fiscal year 2015-2016, highlighting a significant decline in the tax base.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "While the bill's defective effective date of July 1, 3000 (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_1) precludes any immediate fiscal impact, new testimony provides projections that could inform a multi-year outlook if the date is amended. Testimony projects that a $1.00 per pack increase would generate $10.84 million (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_19_1.pdf) in new revenue in its first year. The same testimony includes projected 5-year Medicaid program savings of $990,000 (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_19_1.pdf) and additional 5-year health care cost savings totaling $770,000, which includes $360,000 (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_19_1.pdf) from fewer lung cancer cases, $190,000 (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_19_1.pdf) from fewer smoking-affected pregnancies, and $220,000 (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_19_1.pdf) from fewer heart attacks and strokes. However, these potential gains would be set against a backdrop of declining base revenue, which testimony shows has fallen from over $116 million (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_) in FY 2015-2016 to just over $70 million (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_) in FY 2023-2024.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "Testimony from advocacy groups projects a potential increase in operating revenue, with a proposed $1.00 per pack tax hike estimated to generate $10.84 million (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_19) in new annual revenue. This potential short-term increase contrasts with the long-term trend of declining revenues from this source. The Department of the Attorney General's testimony shows that overall cigarette tax revenues have decreased from over $116 million (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_) in fiscal year 2015-2016 to just over $70 million (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_) in fiscal year 2023-2024, indicating that any new revenue would be generated from a shrinking base.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "Testimony highlights the unsustainability of relying on cigarette tax revenues for long-term funding obligations. The Department of the Attorney General testified that revenues have declined sharply from over $116 million (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_) to just over $70 million (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_) in an eight-year period. The Tax Foundation of Hawaii's testimony reinforces this concern, stating that excise taxes on a shrinking tax base provide a volatile and poor source for funding ongoing government services (TAX FOUNDATION OF HAWAII).",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The bill has now passed through the House Committee on Finance and is recommended for Third Reading, though it still lacks specific fiscal figures (HB441_HD2_HSCR905_). New testimony has provided detailed FY2024 financial data, such as the total cigarette revenue of $70,092,426 (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_), and specific distributions to various special funds. Competing proposals for higher tax increases have been introduced, along with corresponding revenue projections, such as a $1.00 per pack increase that testimony estimates would generate $10.84 million (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_19) in new annual revenue. Finally, significant new economic data has been presented, including testimony estimating annual smoking-related healthcare costs in Hawaii at $611 million (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_3)."
