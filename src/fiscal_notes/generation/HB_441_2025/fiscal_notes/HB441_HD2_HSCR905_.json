  "overview": "This measure has passed the House Committee on Finance and is recommended for Third Reading, indicating it is advancing despite the tax rate and allocations remaining unspecified. The bill's intent is to increase the cigarette tax and provide additional funding to the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund. The measure retains a defective effective date to encourage further discussion.",
  "appropriations": "While the bill text remains blank, testimony before the committee proposed specific funding changes, including increasing the tax to 18.00 cents per cigarette and allocating 4.0 cents of that to the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund. An alternative proposal suggested a $1.00 per pack increase, which would generate an estimated $10.84 million in new annual revenue for the state's special funds and general fund. No formal appropriations have been inserted into the measure.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "Fiscal projections are based on the principle that a 10% price increase reduces cigarette consumption by 3-5%, with a higher impact on youth. A detailed forecast for a $1.00 per pack increase projects $10.84 million in new first-year revenue, factoring in both the higher tax rate and the anticipated decline in sales. This analysis is supported by historical data showing cigarette tax revenue has declined from a peak of $135.6 million in FY2011 to approximately $70 million in FY2024.",
  "agency_impact": "The Department of Taxation anticipates requiring significant lead time for implementation, requesting an effective date of January 1, 2026, to update tax stamps and internal systems. The Department of the Attorney General expects the measure to provide crucial funding for its Tobacco Enforcement Special Fund, which has seen revenues fall to $1.03 million, thereby safeguarding over $36.4 million in annual Master Settlement Agreement payments. The University of Hawai ªi Cancer Center anticipates the additional revenue will be critical for retaining researchers and supporting clinical trials.",
  "economic_impact": "Proponents estimate that a $1.00 per pack increase could yield $31.8 million in long-term healthcare savings by reducing smoking, which currently costs the state an estimated $611 million annually in direct healthcare expenses. Opponents from the retail sector predict a negative economic impact, arguing that higher taxes will fuel an illicit market, leading to revenue loss for legitimate businesses and a potential net reduction in state tax collections. The tax is also characterized by some as regressive, disproportionately affecting low-income consumers.",
  "policy_impact": "This measure modifies HRS Chapter 245 to address revenue shortfalls for state health programs caused by declining cigarette sales, a tax which has not been increased since 2011. The policy aims to ensure fiscal stability for critical special funds and support the state's enforcement of the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement, which generates over $36 million in annual revenue. The legislative discussion has also highlighted broader policy considerations, such as expanding the tax base to include all tobacco and vaping products for a more sustainable long-term solution.",
  "revenue_sources": "The program is funded by an increase in the state excise tax on cigarettes and little cigars under HRS Chapter 245. Revenue from this tax is the designated source for the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund, Trauma System Special Fund, Community Health Centers Special Fund, and Emergency Medical Services Special Fund. Any revenue remaining after these allocations is deposited into the state's General Fund.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "A proposed $1.00 per pack increase is projected to generate approximately $10.84 million in new revenue in the first year, beginning in FY2026 based on the Department of Taxation's implementation timeline. This revenue is expected to decline progressively over the six-year period due to reduced cigarette consumption, mirroring the trend following the last tax increase in 2011. While providing a short-term boost to special funds, the underlying reliance on a diminishing tax base presents a long-term fiscal sustainability challenge for the programs it supports. No new state positions are anticipated as a result of this measure.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The measure is projected to increase state operating revenues by an estimated $10.84 million in its first year, assuming a $1.00 per pack tax increase is adopted. This new revenue would be allocated across several special funds and the general fund. However, some testimony suggests this gain could be partially offset by a reduction in total tax collections if consumers shift to untaxed illicit markets.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "No significant capital expenditures are anticipated as a result of this measure. The increased revenues are intended to support ongoing program operations, research, and services. These funds are not designated for new construction, facilities, or major equipment purchases.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "Beyond the six-year outlook, the fiscal support provided by this tax increase is expected to diminish as cigarette sales continue to decline. The underlying issue of funding ongoing health programs with a structurally unstable revenue source will likely persist. Consequently, alternative or broader-based funding mechanisms may be necessary to ensure the long-term financial stability of the affected special funds.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The primary update is that the measure has advanced from the House Committee on Finance and is now recommended for Third Reading, confirming continued legislative momentum. Although the bill's text still contains no specific tax rate, the committee received detailed testimony proposing amounts ranging from an 18-cent per cigarette tax to a $1.00 per pack increase, with the latter projected to generate $10.84 million in new revenue. New information on specific agency impacts has also emerged, including a request from the Department of Taxation for a January 1, 2026 effective date to manage administrative requirements."
