  "overview": "The purpose of this measure is to increase the cigarette tax beginning July 1, 2025, and allocate the increase in the cigarette tax revenues into certain special funds (HB441_HD2_HSCR905_.PDF.txt). The Department of the Attorney General supports the bill's purpose to increase the tax rate on each cigarette or little cigar sold and amend the disposition of revenues to increase the amount allocated to the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_.PDF.txt). Your Committee on Finance is in accord with the intent and purpose of H.B. No. 441, H.D. 2, and recommends that it pass Third Reading (HB441_HD2_HSCR905_.PDF.txt).",
  "appropriations": "The Department of the Attorney General respectfully asks that the committee insert the tax increase amount of 18.00 cents on page 4, line 1, and insert the 4.0 cents per cigarette increased amount to be deposited to the credit of the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund on page 10, line 11 (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_.PDF.txt). The Department also recommends reinserting the cents per cigarette amounts and cap amounts for the Trauma System Special Fund, the Community Health Centers Special Fund, and the Emergency Medical Services Special Fund (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_.PDF.txt).",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "Testimony projects long-term health care cost savings from adult and youth smoking declines could reach $41.22 million (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_.PDF.txt). In contrast, another projection within the same testimony estimates these long-term savings at $31.80 million (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_.PDF.txt).",
  "agency_impact": "The Department of the Attorney Generalâ€™s Tobacco Enforcement Special Fund has experienced a revenue decline due to reduced cigarettes sales, with revenue dropping from $1.74 million (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_.PDF.txt) in fiscal year 2015-2016 to $1.03 million (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_.PDF.txt) in 2023-2024 (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_.PDF.txt). These decisions highlight a critical need for stable funding for the Department to maintain and further its diligent enforcement efforts and reduce the risk of losing MSA revenue, as Hawaii received over $36.4 million (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_.PDF.txt) in MSA payments for fiscal year 2023-2024 (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_.PDF.txt).",
  "economic_impact": "The annual estimated health care costs directly caused by smoking in Hawaii is $611 million (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_.PDF.txt), and smoking-caused government expenditures result in a tax burden of $955.00 (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_.PDF.txt) per household and $1.1 billion (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_.PDF.txt) in lost productivity (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_.PDF.txt). Conversely, testimony notes that cigarette tax revenue has significantly decreased, with 2023 collections of $76.8 million (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_.PDF.txt) being 43.4 percent lower than the peak in 2011, which was $135.6 million (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_.PDF.txt).",
  "policy_impact": "The Committee on Finance recommends that H.B. No. 441, H.D. 2, pass Third Reading (HB441_HD2_HSCR905_.PDF.txt). The Department of the Attorney General suggests the Committee also consider House Bill No. 1085 as a viable option, which aims to move away from relying on cigarette taxes and expands the tax revenue base to include all revenue collected under chapter 245, HRS, including new tax revenue from e-cigarettes and e-liquids (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_.PDF.txt).",

Other revenue sources under chapter 245, HRS, for FY24 include taxes on large cigars totaling $2,106,800 (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_.PDF.txt), and taxes on ESDs & e-liquids totaling $12,083,794 (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_.PDF.txt). However, cigarette tax stamp revenues have plummeted from over $116 million (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_.PDF.txt) in fiscal year 2015-2016 to just over $70 million (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_.PDF.txt) in fiscal year 2023-2024 (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_.PDF.txt).",

Additionally, there are projected 5-year health care cost savings from fewer smoking-affected pregnancies and births of $210,000 (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_.PDF.txt). Further savings include a projected $250,000 (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_.PDF.txt) over five years from fewer smoking-caused heart attacks and strokes. The 5-year Medicaid program savings for the state is estimated at $1.06 million (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_.PDF.txt).

  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The Department of the Attorney General's testimony states that continued reliance on declining cigarette tax revenue is unsustainable (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_.PDF.txt). Another testimony notes that revenues produced by the tobacco tax have been in steady decline over the past few years, making fiscal reliance on these funds inadvisable (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_.PDF.txt). This suggests that earmarking funds from this source for ongoing programs creates long-term financial uncertainty (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_.PDF.txt).",

Updated five-year health care cost savings projections have been provided, including a new long-term savings estimate of $41.22 million (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_.PDF.txt). New testimony provides more precise historical revenue data, showing a decline from a peak of $135.6 million (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_.PDF.txt) in 2011 to $76.8 million (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-21-25_.PDF.txt) in 2023, underscoring the unsustainability of this revenue source."
