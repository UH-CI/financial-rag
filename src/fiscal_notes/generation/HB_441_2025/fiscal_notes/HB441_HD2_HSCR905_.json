  "overview": "Testimony before the House Finance Committee introduced several proposed tax rates, with the Department of the Attorney General supporting an 18.00 cent (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_ATG_02-21-25.PDF.txt) per cigarette increase, while advocacy groups proposed a larger increase of at least $1.00 per pack (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_TFK_02-21-25.PDF.txt). The Department of Taxation has requested the effective date be amended to January 1, 2026 (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_DOTAX_02-21-25.PDF.txt) to allow sufficient time for implementation. The committee has since passed the measure with the tax rate and allocations remaining unspecified (HB441_HD2_HSCR905_).",
  "appropriations": "Testimony from the Department of the Attorney General provided current revenue data, showing total cigarette revenue for FY24 was $70,092,426 (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_ATG_02-21-25.PDF.txt), with $8,606,752 (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_ATG_02-21-25.PDF.txt) allocated to the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund. Advocacy groups submitted projections suggesting a $1.00 per pack tax increase would generate $10.84 million (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_TFK_02-21-25.PDF.txt) in new annual state revenue. The Attorney General also testified that its Tobacco Enforcement Special Fund revenue has dropped to $1.03 million (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_ATG_02-21-25.PDF.txt) in 2023-2024, down from $1.74 million (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_ATG_02-21-25.PDF.txt) in fiscal year 2015-2016.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "Projections for a proposed $1.00 per pack tax increase were provided in testimony based on an economic model developed by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids and the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network with economists from the Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_TFK-ACSCAN-Projections_02-21-25.PDF.txt). The model assumes that each 10% increase in the retail price of cigarettes reduces total consumption by about 4% and generates new revenue despite the drop in sales. These projections estimate $10.84 million (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_TFK-ACSCAN-Projections_02-21-25.PDF.txt) in new annual revenue and include adjustments for tax evasion.",
  "agency_impact": "The Department of Taxation testified that it would require an effective date of January 1, 2026 (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_DOTAX_02-21-25.PDF.txt), to provide sufficient time to update tax stamps and implement necessary system and form changes. The Department of the Attorney General testified that its Tobacco Enforcement Special Fund needs recuperated funding to ensure diligent enforcement of the Master Settlement Agreement, which provided Hawaii with over $36.4 million (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_ATG_02-21-25.PDF.txt) in payments for fiscal year 2023-2024. Without increased funding, the Department warns of a risk of losing this revenue.",
  "economic_impact": "Testimony from the Department of Health stated that annual health care costs directly caused by smoking in Hawaii total an estimated $611 million (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_DOH_02-21-25.PDF.txt), with associated productivity losses of $1.1 billion (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_DOH_02-21-25.PDF.txt). Advocacy group projections indicate a $1.00 per pack increase could lead to long-term health care cost savings of $31.80 million (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_TFK-ACSCAN-Projections_02-21-25.PDF.txt). Conversely, opposition testimony from retailers argued that a tax increase would harm small businesses and drive consumers to an untaxed black market, resulting in lost tax revenue for the state.",
  "policy_impact": "The House Committee on Finance has advanced the bill while keeping the tax rate and specific allocations as unspecified blanks, as affirmed in its committee report (HB441_HD2_HSCR905_). This action defers the final decision on the fiscal details to a later point in the legislative process, likely a conference committee. Advocacy groups are attempting to influence the final policy by providing testimony that a larger tax increase of $1.00 per pack (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_TFK_02-21-25.PDF.txt) would yield greater public health benefits than the originally proposed amounts.",
  "revenue_sources": "Testimony highlighted the declining reliability of the current cigarette tax as a revenue source. The Department of the Attorney General testified that cigarette tax stamp revenues have fallen from over $116 million (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_ATG_02-21-25.PDF.txt) in fiscal year 2015-2016 to just over $70 million (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_ATG_02-21-25.PDF.txt) in fiscal year 2023-2024. The proposed tax increase aims to generate new revenue from this source to support the general fund and several health-related special funds. Opposition testimony contends that a tax increase would shrink the legal tax base further by encouraging illicit sales.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "Advocacy groups testified that a $1.00 per pack increase would generate an estimated $10.84 million (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_TFK-ACSCAN-Projections_02-21-25.PDF.txt) in new revenue in its first year. Over a five-year period, this increase is projected to produce health care cost savings, including $360,000 (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_TFK-ACSCAN-Projections_02-21-25.PDF.txt) from fewer smoking-caused lung cancer cases and $990,000 (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_TFK-ACSCAN-Projections_02-21-25.PDF.txt) in state Medicaid program savings. The Department of Taxation's requested January 1, 2026 (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_DOTAX_02-21-25.PDF.txt) effective date would shift the initial revenue impact to the second half of fiscal year 2026. Testimony from the Tax Foundation suggests that while a tax increase is likely to boost revenue in the short term, this additional revenue will decrease each year as smoking rates decline. The Attorney General's testimony suggests that without a funding increase, the state is at risk of losing over $36.4 million (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_ATG_02-21-25.PDF.txt) in annual Master Settlement Agreement payments due to insufficient enforcement.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "Testimony has provided a specific projection for increased operating revenue under an alternative tax scenario. A proposed $1.00 per pack increase is estimated to generate $10.84 million (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_TFK_02-21-25.PDF.txt) in new annual revenue. This provides a quantifiable alternative to the unspecified increase in the current bill draft. However, testimony from retailers in opposition warns that this could be offset by a decrease in legally collected revenue due to a shift in sales to the black market.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "Testimony from multiple sources raises concerns about the long-term sustainability of relying on cigarette taxes for funding. The Department of the Attorney General's testimony states that continued reliance on declining cigarette tax revenue is 'unsustainable' (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_ATG_02-21-25.PDF.txt) and suggests expanding the tax base to other products. Similarly, the Tax Foundation's testimony describes excise taxes on a shrinking base as a 'volatile source of tax revenue' (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_Tax-Foundation_02-21-25.PDF.txt) and a 'poor policy solution' for funding ongoing government services.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "New testimony has introduced specific financial projections and agency impacts that were previously absent. Advocacy groups have submitted data estimating that an alternative $1.00 per pack tax increase would generate $10.84 million (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_TFK_02-21-25.PDF.txt) in new revenue and $31.80 million (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_TFK-ACSCAN-Projections_02-21-25.PDF.txt) in long-term health savings. The Department of Taxation has specified its operational need for a January 1, 2026 (HB441_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_DOTAX_02-21-25.PDF.txt) effective date, and the Attorney General detailed the decline in its special fund revenue. A new committee report (HB441_HD2_HSCR905_) confirms the House Finance Committee has passed the measure while keeping the tax rate and funding allocations as unspecified blanks, deferring the decision."
