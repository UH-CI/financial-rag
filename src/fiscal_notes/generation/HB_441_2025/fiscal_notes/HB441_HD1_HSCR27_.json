  "overview": "The purpose of this measure is to increase the cigarette tax and allocate the increase to be deposited into the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund. [4] As amended by the Committee on Health, the measure's effective date was changed to July 1, 3000, to encourage further discussion. [4] The Department of Taxation requests that the effective date be amended to January 1, 2026 to provide sufficient time for DOTAX to update stamps and implement the system and form changes. [2]",
  "appropriations": "Cigarette tax stamp revenues have plummeted, from over $116 million (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_.PDF.txt) in fiscal year 2015-2016 to just over $70 million (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_.PDF.txt) in fiscal year 2023-2024. [2] This decline has affected the funding for the University of Hawaii Cancer Center, community health centers, trauma centers, and emergency medical services. [2]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "Testimony from multiple public health organizations projects that a $1.00 (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_.PDF.txt) per pack cigarette tax increase in Hawaiʻi will generate $10.84 million (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_.PDF.txt) in new annual revenue in its first year. [2] According to the U.S. Surgeon General, increasing the price of tobacco products is the single most effective way to reduce consumption. [2] A ten percent increase in price has been estimated to reduce overall cigarette consumption by 3-5%. [2]",
  "agency_impact": "The Department of Taxation (DOTAX) requests that the current effective date be amended to January 1, 2026 to provide sufficient time to update stamps and implement the system and form changes necessary for the proposed increase. [2] The Department of the Attorney General’s Tobacco Enforcement Special Fund has experienced a revenue decline, with revenue dropping from $1.74 million (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_.PDF.txt) in fiscal year 2015-2016 to $1.03 million (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_.PDF.txt) in 2023-2024. [2] [2] This jeopardizes the Department's ability to maintain diligent enforcement efforts required under the Master Settlement Agreement, from which Hawaii received over $36.4 million (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_.PDF.txt) in MSA payments for fiscal year 2023-2024. [2] [2]",
  "economic_impact": "The annual estimated health care costs directly caused by smoking in Hawaii is $611 million (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_.PDF.txt). [2] Smoking-caused government expenditures result in a tax burden of $955.00 (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_.PDF.txt) per household and $1.1 billion (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_.PDF.txt) in lost productivity in Hawaii. [2] Testimony projects that a $1.00 (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_.PDF.txt) per pack tax increase would save the state more than $31.8 million (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_.PDF.txt) in long-term health care costs. [2]",
  "policy_impact": "The Committee on Health amended this measure, resulting in H.B. No. 441, H.D. 1, which now has an effective date of July 1, 3000. [4] The amended bill was recommended for referral to the Committee on Higher Education. [4] Several testimonies support amending the bill to increase the tax by $1.00 (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_.PDF.txt) per pack (a 5 cent per cigarette increase) to maximize public health benefits, rather than the proposed 2 cent increase. [2] [2]",
  "revenue_sources": "Total Cigarette Revenue for fiscal year 2024 was $70,092,426 (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_.PDF.txt).

[2] Other revenue sources included $12,083,794 (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_.PDF.txt) from electronic smoking devices and other tobacco products, and $1,032,810 (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_.PDF.txt) from the cigarette tax stamp fee. [2] [2]",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The amended bill contains an effective date of July 1, 3000, making a six-year fiscal projection based on the current bill text impractical. [4] The Department of Taxation requests an effective date of January 1, 2026, to allow for implementation. [2] Based on testimony, a hypothetical $1.00 (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_.PDF.txt) per pack tax increase is projected to generate $10.84 million (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_.PDF.txt) in new annual revenue. [2] Over a 5-year period, this increase is projected to yield health care cost savings of $360,000 (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_.PDF.txt) from fewer lung cancer cases, $190,000 (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_.PDF.txt) from fewer smoking-affected pregnancies, and $220,000 (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_.PDF.txt) from fewer heart attacks and strokes. [2] [2] Additionally, a 5-year Medicaid program savings for the state is projected at $990,000 (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_.PDF.txt). [2] Public health benefits include 500 youth prevented from becoming adults who smoke, 2,000 current adults who would quit, and 500 premature smoking-caused deaths prevented. [2] [2]",

  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The bill's amended effective date of July 1, 3000, makes long-term fiscal implications uncertain until a functional effective date is adopted. [4] Testimony from the Department of the Attorney General notes that continued reliance on declining cigarette tax revenue is unsustainable for funding state programs. [2]",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The primary update is the amendment of the bill's effective date from July 1, 2025, to July 1, 3000, to encourage further discussion. [4] The Department of Taxation submitted new testimony requesting an effective date of January 1, 2026, to allow sufficient time for implementation. [2] New testimony provides specific fiscal data on the decline of cigarette tax revenues, which fell from over $116 million (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_.PDF.txt) in FY 2016 to just over $70 million (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_.PDF.txt) in FY 2024. [2] Multiple testimonies advocate for amending the bill to include a larger tax increase, such as $1.00 (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_.PDF.txt) per pack, and provide detailed projections on the potential for new revenue and long-term healthcare cost savings.
