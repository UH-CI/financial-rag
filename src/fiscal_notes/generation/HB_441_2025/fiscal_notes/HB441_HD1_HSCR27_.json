  "overview": "",
  "appropriations": "",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "Updated testimony introduces projections for an alternative, larger tax increase not previously considered. Advocacy groups estimate that a proposed $1.00 per pack increase would generate $10.84 million (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_) in new annual revenue. This alternative methodology also projects long-term healthcare cost savings of $31.80 million (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_).",
  "agency_impact": "New testimony specifies the revenue decline experienced by the Department of the Attorney General's Tobacco Enforcement Special Fund, which dropped from $1.74 million (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_) in fiscal year 2015-2016 to $1.03 million (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_) in 2023-2024. This provides a specific financial context for the agency's support of the bill. The department also noted it received over $36.4 million (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_) in Master Settlement Agreement payments for fiscal year 2023-2024, which are jeopardized without adequate enforcement funding.",
  "economic_impact": "New information quantifies the annual economic burden of smoking, with estimated healthcare costs in Hawaii totaling $611 million (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_). Furthermore, testimony suggests that a proposed alternative $1.00 per pack tax increase could yield $31.80 million (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_) in long-term healthcare savings. Smoking-caused government expenditures also result in a tax burden of $955.00 (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_) per household.",
  "policy_impact": "The House Committee on Health has amended the measure to change the effective date to July 1, 3000 (HB441_HD1_HSCR27_). This amendment was made to encourage further discussion on the bill's provisions. This change effectively postpones the policy implementation indefinitely.",
  "revenue_sources": "Updated testimony provides a specific baseline for current revenues, with total cigarette tax revenue for fiscal year 2024 reported at $70,092,426 (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_). While the bill's proposed 2-cent increase is unchanged, new analysis from advocacy groups projects that an alternative $1.00 per pack increase could generate $10.84 million (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_) in new annual revenue. The source of funds remains the state excise tax on cigarettes.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The House Draft 1 version of the bill has an amended effective date of July 1, 3000 (HB441_HD1_HSCR27_). Consequently, there are no fiscal implications within the next six years. All fiscal impacts detailed in the previous note are deferred until that future date.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "New data provides a precise baseline for current operating revenues affected by this bill. In fiscal year 2024, total cigarette tax revenue was $70,092,426 (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_). From this total, the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund received $8,606,752 (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_), providing a specific starting point for measuring the impact of the proposed allocation increase.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "Due to the amended effective date of July 1, 3000 (HB441_HD1_HSCR27_), the fiscal implications outlined previously will not materialize for several centuries. The long-term funding framework for the cancer center remains the bill's intent, but its implementation is no longer within a foreseeable timeframe.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The primary update is the amendment changing the bill's effective date to July 1, 3000 (HB441_HD1_HSCR27_), which postpones all fiscal impacts indefinitely. New testimony has introduced specific financial data for fiscal year 2024, such as the total cigarette revenue of $70,092,426 (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_), providing a concrete baseline for analysis. Additionally, there is now significant discussion and data related to an alternative proposal for a larger, $1.00 per pack tax increase, which projects new annual revenue of $10.84 million (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_) and greater public health benefits."
