  "overview": "The bill's effective date has been amended to July 1, 3000 (HB441_HD1_HSCR27_), a placeholder intended to encourage further discussion, which is a change from the previous date of January 1, 2026. Testimony from the Department of Health highlights that smoking-related annual health care costs in Hawaii total $611 million (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_). Testimonies also emphasize that overall cigarette tax stamp revenues have declined from over $116 million (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_) in fiscal year 2015-2016 to just over $70 million (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_) in fiscal year 2023-2024.",
  "appropriations": "While the appropriation mechanism remains unchanged, new testimony provides specific funding levels for fiscal year 2024, showing the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund received $8,606,752 (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_) under the current 2.0 cent allocation. Other funds also received specific amounts, such as the Trauma System Special Fund which received $5,379,220 (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_), and the Community Health Centers Special Fund which also received $5,379,220 (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_). The Emergency Medical Services Special Fund received $4,841,298 (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_) in fiscal year 2024.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The new fiscal analysis incorporates projections for an alternative tax increase proposed in testimony; the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network estimates that a $1.00 per pack increase would generate $10.84 million (American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network | 2370 Nu’uanu Avenue | Honolulu, HI 96817 |fightcancer.org) in new annual revenue. The underlying assumptions are supported by data from the Department of Health indicating annual smoking-related health care costs in Hawaii are $611 million (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_). These projections also factor in potential cost savings of $31.80 million (American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network | 2370 Nu’uanu Avenue | Honolulu, HI 96817 |fightcancer.org) in long-term health care costs from reduced smoking rates.",
  "agency_impact": "The Department of Taxation testimony requests that the effective date be amended to January 1, 2026 (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_) to provide sufficient time for implementation, a specific timeline not previously detailed. The Department of the Attorney General testimony indicates its Tobacco Enforcement Special Fund revenue has dropped from $1.74 million (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_) in fiscal year 2015-2016 to $1.03 million (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_) in 2023-2024 due to declining cigarette sales. This revenue decline affects the Department's ability to enforce the Master Settlement Agreement.",
  "economic_impact": "New testimony specifies the economic burden of smoking, including $1.1 billion (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_) in lost productivity and a tax burden of $955.00 (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_) per household in Hawaii. An alternative proposal to increase the tax by $1.00 per pack projects long-term health care cost savings of $31.80 million (American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network | 2370 Nu’uanu Avenue | Honolulu, HI 96817 |fightcancer.org) from reduced smoking. The measure aims to mitigate the economic impact of declining tax revenue on state-funded health programs.",
  "policy_impact": "New testimony from the Department of the Attorney General links the measure's fiscal stability to the state's ability to diligently enforce the Master Settlement Agreement (MSA). Failure to maintain enforcement efforts due to declining revenue could jeopardize the over $36.4 million (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_) in MSA payments Hawaii received for fiscal year 2023-2024. This establishes a direct policy implication between the cigarette tax structure and the retention of significant national settlement funds.",
  "revenue_sources": "New data provides a detailed breakdown of current cigarette and tobacco tax revenues, showing total cigarette revenue for fiscal year 2024 was approximately $70,092,426 (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_). This is a significant decrease from the over $116 million (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_) collected in fiscal year 2015-2016. In addition to cigarette taxes, other related revenue sources in fiscal year 2024 included $12,083,794 (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_) from electronic smoking devices and e-liquids.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The bill’s effective date has been amended to July 1, 3000 (HB441_HD1_HSCR27_), meaning the proposed tax increase will have no fiscal impact within the next six years unless the date is amended again. The previous fiscal note's projections were based on a January 1, 2026 effective date. Current fiscal year 2024 data shows that the Trauma System Special Fund received $5,379,220 (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_), the Community Health Centers Special Fund received $5,379,220 (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_), and the Emergency Medical Services Special Fund received $4,841,298 (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_), all below their statutory caps, illustrating the impact of declining overall revenues. The continued decline in cigarette tax stamp revenues, which fell from over $116 million (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_) in FY 2015-2016 to approximately $70 million (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_) in FY 2023-2024, underscores the fiscal challenge the bill seeks to address in the long term.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "New testimony quantifies the current revenue stream that would be impacted, noting the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund received $8,606,752 (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_) in fiscal year 2024 from the existing 2.0 cent per cigarette allocation. Doubling this allocation to 4.0 cents per cigarette is intended to counteract the revenue decline caused by reduced cigarette consumption. Total cigarette tax revenue for fiscal year 2024 was $70,092,426 (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_).",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The amended effective date of July 1, 3000 (HB441_HD1_HSCR27_), means the fiscal implications described previously will not materialize unless the date is changed. Testimony from the Department of the Attorney General raises a long-term policy consideration, suggesting the state should expand the tax base to all products under chapter 245, HRS, including e-cigarettes, to create a more sustainable revenue source. This highlights concerns about the continued viability of relying solely on declining cigarette tax revenues for long-term funding.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The primary update is the change of the bill's effective date to a placeholder of July 1, 3000 (HB441_HD1_HSCR27_), which defers all fiscal impacts until the date is amended. This fiscal note now incorporates specific fiscal year 2024 revenue data, including the total cigarette tax revenue of approximately $70,092,426 (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_) and detailed allocations to various special funds. It also adds new economic data on the costs of smoking, such as the $611 million (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_) in annual healthcare costs, and includes projections for an alternative tax increase proposed in testimony that estimates $10.84 million (American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network | 2370 Nu’uanu Avenue | Honolulu, HI 96817 |fightcancer.org) in new revenue. Finally, a new policy consideration has been added, linking the tax revenue to the enforcement of the Master Settlement Agreement, which generated over $36.4 million (HB441_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_) in fiscal year 2024."
