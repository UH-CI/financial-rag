  "agency_impact": "Due to the amended effective date of July 1, 3000, there is no immediate administrative or budgetary impact on any state agency, including the Department of Taxation and the University of Hawaii Cancer Center. All previously anticipated impacts are now contingent on future amendments that would establish a viable effective date. The Department of Taxation's prior request to delay implementation to January 1, 2026, is rendered moot by this amendment.",

  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "As a result of the amended effective date of July 1, 3000, this measure will have no fiscal implications within the next six years or for the foreseeable future. The previously projected increase in revenue for the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund and the associated one-time administrative costs for the Department of Taxation are nullified. There is no projected change to state revenues or expenditures during the standard six-year fiscal planning period.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The measure will have no impact on the state's operating revenue. The previously anticipated increase in cigarette tax collections will not occur as the tax rate change is not scheduled to take effect within the foreseeable future.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "There are no fiscal implications after six years, as the bill's provisions are not scheduled to take effect until July 1, 3000.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The most significant update is the amendment of the bill's effective date from July 1, 2025, to July 1, 3000. This change renders the measure fiscally inert for the foreseeable future, nullifying all previously estimated revenue gains and agency costs. The purpose of this 'defective effective date' is to encourage further discussion on the measure. The bill has been passed by the House Committee on Health and referred to the Committee on Higher Education."
