  "overview": "The purpose of this measure is to increase the cigarette tax from sixteen to eighteen cents beginning January 1, 2026, and allocate the increased revenue to the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund (HB441_CD1_CCR257_). The Conference Committee has amended the measure to specify that these revenues be used exclusively for debt service of capital expenditures and building maintenance until June 30, 2030, a change from the previous date of June 30, 2041 (HB441_CD1_CCR257_). The measure also now requires that starting July 1, 2030, two cents per cigarette from the fund shall be used for these purposes (HB441_CD1_CCR257_).",
  "appropriations": "This measure amends the disposition of cigarette tax revenues by allocating the increase in the cigarette tax amount to the Hawaii cancer research special fund (HB441_CD1_.HTM.txt). From January 1, 2026, until June 30, 2030, 4.0 cents per cigarette deposited into the fund shall be used exclusively for debt service of capital expenditures and building maintenance (HB441_CD1_.HTM.txt). Beginning July 1, 2030, this exclusive allocation for debt service is reduced to 2.0 cents per cigarette (HB441_CD1_.HTM.txt).",

  "policy_impact": "Your Committee on Conference has amended this measure by altering the timeline for the exclusive use of allocated cigarette tax revenues for the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund (HB441_CD1_CCR257_). The key policy change specifies that funds be used for debt service and maintenance until June 30, 2030, rather than the previously stipulated June 30, 2041 (HB441_CD1_CCR257_). Additionally, the measure now establishes a two-tiered system, requiring that beginning July 1, 2030, two cents per cigarette deposited into the fund shall be used for these purposes, and changes the effective date to December 31, 2025 (HB441_CD1_CCR257_).",
  "revenue_sources": "While the primary focus is the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund, the statute governing the disposition of cigarette tax revenues also places caps on allocations to other special funds. The legislative document specifies that 1.125 cents per cigarette, but no more than $7,400,000 (HB441_CD1_.HTM.txt) in a fiscal year, shall be deposited to the credit of the trauma system special fund. Similarly, 1.25 cents per cigarette, but no more than $8,800,000 (HB441_CD1_.HTM.txt) in a fiscal year, is deposited to the credit of the community health centers special fund, with an identical cap of $8,800,000 (HB441_CD1_.HTM.txt) for the emergency medical services special fund.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "Beginning January 1, 2026, the cigarette tax is increased from sixteen cents to eighteen cents (HB441_CD1_.HTM.txt). The disposition of revenues is amended so that after December 31, 2025, 4.0 cents per cigarette will be deposited to the credit of the Hawaii cancer research special fund (HB441_CD1_.HTM.txt). A new provision specifies that until June 30, 2030, this amount shall be used exclusively for debt service of capital expenditures and building maintenance (HB441_CD1_.HTM.txt). This creates a dedicated funding stream for these purposes for approximately four and a half years. The six-year outlook includes a significant change on July 1, 2030. At that point, the amount dedicated exclusively to debt service from the fund will be reduced to 2.0 cents per cigarette (HB441_CD1_.HTM.txt). This structured reduction in dedicated funding is a primary fiscal implication within this timeframe.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "This measure will increase state operating revenue by increasing the excise tax on each cigarette or little cigar sold, used, or possessed by a wholesaler or dealer from 16.00 cents to 18.00 cents on and after January 1, 2026 (HB441_CD1_.HTM.txt). The disposition of revenues after this date is amended to allocate 4.0 cents per cigarette to the credit of the Hawaii cancer research special fund (HB441_CD1_.HTM.txt). This represents an increase from the 2.0 cents per cigarette allocated to the fund prior to January 1, 2026 (HB441_CD1_.HTM.txt).",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The measure has been amended to shorten the period during which all allocated cigarette tax revenues for the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund are dedicated to capital-related costs. The bill now specifies that these funds be used exclusively for debt service of capital expenditures and building maintenance until June 30, 2030, rather than June 30, 2041 (HB441_CD1_CCR257_). Beginning July 1, 2030, the amount dedicated to these capital expenditures is reduced from 4.0 cents to 2.0 cents per cigarette (HB441_CD1_CCR257_).",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "A key long-term fiscal implication is the scheduled reduction in dedicated funding for debt service. The measure requires that beginning July 1, 2030, the amount from the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund used exclusively for debt service of capital expenditures and building maintenance will be 2.0 cents per cigarette (HB441_CD1_CCR257_). This is a decrease from the 4.0 cents per cigarette allocated for this purpose in the years immediately preceding this date. This change modifies the long-term revenue stream dedicated to servicing the cancer center's capital-related debts.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The Conference Committee has significantly amended the measure, altering its long-term fiscal impact. The primary update is changing the end date for which 4.0 cents per cigarette is used exclusively for debt service from June 30, 2041, to June 30, 2030 (HB441_CD1_CCR257_). A new, two-tiered funding structure has been introduced, which reduces the amount for debt service to 2.0 cents per cigarette beginning on July 1, 2030 (HB441_CD1_CCR257_). Finally, the effective date of the act has been changed to December 31, 2025 (HB441_CD1_CCR257_)."
