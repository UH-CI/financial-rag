  "overview": "This Act increases the cigarette tax from sixteen cents to eighteen cents and amends the disposition of cigarette tax revenues by allocating the increase in the cigarette tax amount to the Hawaii cancer research special fund. [16] [16] A portion of the allocated funds will be used exclusively for debt service of capital expenditures and building maintenance until June 30, 2030, with a different amount allocated for the same purpose thereafter. [16] [16] The Act shall take effect on December 31, 2025. [16]",
  "appropriations": "After December 31, 2025, 4.0 cents per cigarette shall be deposited to the credit of the Hawaii cancer research special fund for research and operating expenses and for capital expenditures. [16] Until June 30, 2030, the full 4.0 cents per cigarette deposited under this paragraph shall be used exclusively for debt service of capital expenditures and building maintenance.

  "economic_impact": "A decline in smoking has resulted in a decrease of over fifty per cent in cigarette tax revenues to the Hawaii cancer research special fund. [16] This decline jeopardizes the revenue stream for debt service for the revenue bonds and diminishes the availability of resources for the cancer research center of Hawaii. [16] [16] The purpose of this Act is to ensure the payment for debt service for the revenue bonds and the continued availability of resources for the cancer research center of Hawaii's research and operations. [16]",
  "policy_impact": "Your Committee on Conference has amended this measure by specifying that all cigarette tax revenues allocated to the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund be used exclusively for debt service of capital expenditures and building maintenance until June 30, 2030, rather than June 30, 2041. [17] The Committee also is requiring that, beginning July 1, 2030, of each amount deposited into the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund, two cents per cigarette shall be used exclusively for debt service of capital expenditures and building maintenance. [17] Finally, the effective date was changed to December 31, 2025. [17]",
  "revenue_sources": "All moneys collected pursuant to this chapter shall be paid into the state treasury as state realizations to be kept and accounted for as provided by law. [16] The measure increases the excise tax from 16.00 cents to 18.00 cents for each cigarette or little cigar sold, used, or possessed by a wholesaler or dealer on and after January 1, 2026.

  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The cigarette tax increases to 18.00 cents for each cigarette on and after January 1, 2026.

[16] For the period from January 1, 2026, through June 30, 2030, the full 4.0 cents per cigarette shall be used exclusively for debt service of capital expenditures and building maintenance. [16] Beginning July 1, 2030, this changes so that 2.0 cents per cigarette shall be used exclusively for debt service. [16] The remaining 2.0 cents per cigarette will then be available for research and operating expenses. [16] During this period, other fund allocations remain capped. [16] [16] The trauma system special fund is capped at not more than $7,400,000 (HB441_CD1_.HTM.txt) in a fiscal year. [16] The community health centers special fund is capped at not more than $8,800,000 (HB441_CD1_.HTM.txt) in a fiscal year.

[16] The remaining revenue from the 4.0 cents per cigarette allocation may be used for research and operating expenses. [16] This creates an ongoing split in the fund's revenue stream between capital debt service and operational costs. [16] [16]",
