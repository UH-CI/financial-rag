  "overview": "This measure increases the cigarette tax from sixteen cents to eighteen cents (HB441_CD1) per cigarette and allocates the additional revenue to the Hawaii cancer research special fund. The bill has been amended to require the full 4.0 cents per cigarette (HB441_CD1) allocated to the fund be used exclusively for debt service and building maintenance only until June 30, 2030 (HB441_CD1), a significant change from the previous 2041 sunset date. Beginning July 1, 2030, this restriction is reduced, dedicating 2.0 cents per cigarette (HB441_CD1) to debt service and freeing the remaining portion for research and operations.",
  "appropriations": "The appropriation to the Hawaii cancer research special fund from cigarette tax revenue has been modified. The mandate requiring that the full 4.0 cents per cigarette (HB441_CD1) be used exclusively for debt service and building maintenance now ends on June 30, 2030 (HB441_CD1). Beginning July 1, 2030, the appropriation for debt service is reduced to 2.0 cents per cigarette (HB441_CD1), allowing the other half to fund research and operating expenses.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "",
  "agency_impact": "The operational impact on the University of Hawaii Cancer Center has been substantially revised. The restriction preventing the use of the special fund allocation for research and operating expenses is now shortened to June 30, 2030 (HB441_CD1_CCR257_), instead of 2041. After this date, the center will regain access to revenues from 2.0 cents per cigarette (HB441_CD1) for its programmatic needs, restoring significant budgetary flexibility.",
  "economic_impact": "",
  "policy_impact": "The policy has been amended from a long-term dedication of funds for capital costs to a more balanced, medium-term approach. The mandate for using the entire 4.0 cents per cigarette (HB441_CD1) for debt service now concludes on June 30, 2030 (HB441_CD1). This revision establishes a clear date, July 1, 2030 (HB441_CD1), when half of the fund's revenue stream will revert to supporting the cancer center's core research mission.",
  "revenue_sources": "",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The six-year fiscal outlook is significantly altered by the amendments. For fiscal years 2026 through 2030, the entire 4.0 cents per cigarette (HB441_CD1) deposited into the Hawaii cancer research special fund is restricted for debt service and building maintenance. Beginning in fiscal year 2031, which starts July 1, 2030, this exclusive dedication is reduced to 2.0 cents per cigarette (HB441_CD1). This change will make half of the fund's revenue available for research and operating expenses starting in the sixth year of the fiscal forecast. The annual caps for the trauma system special fund at $7,400,000 (HB441_CD1), the community health centers special fund at $8,800,000 (HB441_CD1), and the emergency medical services special fund at $8,800,000 (HB441_CD1) are not affected.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The exclusive dedication of cigarette tax revenues for capital-related costs has been amended with a new timeline. The measure now mandates that the entire 4.0 cents per cigarette (HB441_CD1) deposited into the Hawaii cancer research special fund be used for debt service and building maintenance only until June 30, 2030 (HB441_CD1). Following this date, the required allocation for these capital expenditures is reduced to 2.0 cents per cigarette (HB441_CD1) indefinitely.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The long-term fiscal obligations are substantially different from the previous version of the bill. After June 30, 2030, the mandate for debt service and maintenance costs is reduced to an ongoing amount equivalent to the revenue generated by 2.0 cents per cigarette (HB441_CD1). This revision ensures sustained funding for capital debt while also restoring a permanent, recurring revenue source for the Cancer Center's research and operational expenses.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The primary change from the previous fiscal note is the duration of the restriction on funds for the Hawaii cancer research special fund. The previous version mandated that the full 4.0 cents per cigarette be used exclusively for debt service until June 30, 2041. The current bill shortens this exclusive restriction to June 30, 2030 (HB441_CD1_CCR257_), and adds a new provision that beginning July 1, 2030, only 2.0 cents per cigarette (HB441_CD1) shall be used for debt service, freeing the remainder for research and operations."
