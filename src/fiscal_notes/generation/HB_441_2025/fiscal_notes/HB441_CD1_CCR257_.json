  "overview": "This measure increases the cigarette tax from sixteen cents to eighteen cents (HB441_CD1) and allocates the additional revenue to the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund. The primary change in this version is the timeline for the use of these funds for debt service; the exclusive dedication of the full 4.0 cents (HB441_CD1) for debt service and maintenance is now shortened to end on June 30, 2030 (HB441_CD1). Beginning July 1, 2030, the amount restricted for debt service is reduced to 2.0 cents per cigarette (HB441_CD1), freeing up the remaining portion for other research and operating expenses.",
  "appropriations": "This bill directs that after December 31, 2025, a total of 4.0 cents per cigarette (HB441_CD1) shall be deposited to the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund. This version amends the use restriction, requiring the full 4.0 cents per cigarette (HB441_CD1) to be used exclusively for debt service and building maintenance only until June 30, 2030 (HB441_CD1). After that date, the amount dedicated to debt service and maintenance is reduced to 2.0 cents per cigarette (HB441_CD1).",

  "policy_impact": "This conference draft significantly alters the long-term fiscal policy for the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund by shortening the period during which the entire 4.0-cent allocation (HB441_CD1) is restricted to debt service from the year 2041 to June 30, 2030 (HB441_CD1_CCR257_). It establishes a new policy phase beginning July 1, 2030, where only half of the allocation, or 2.0 cents per cigarette (HB441_CD1), is dedicated to debt service. This allows the fund more flexibility for research and operations sooner than anticipated in the previous version.",
  "revenue_sources": "",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The fiscal implications within the six-year outlook are substantially changed by this draft. For the period beginning January 1, 2026, through June 30, 2030, all revenue from the increased allocation of 4.0 cents per cigarette (HB441_CD1) will be dedicated exclusively to debt service and building maintenance. A significant shift occurs on July 1, 2030, which falls within the six-year window, at which point the amount restricted for debt service is reduced to 2.0 cents per cigarette (HB441_CD1). This change will free up revenue from the remaining 2.0 cents per cigarette (HB441_CD1) for the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund's other chartered purposes, such as research and operating expenses. This provides the fund with new operational revenue beginning in Fiscal Year 2031, an outcome not possible under the previous draft.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "This version of the measure will have a delayed but significant positive impact on the operating revenue of the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund. While no new operating revenue is available until Fiscal Year 2031, beginning July 1, 2030, revenue from 2.0 cents per cigarette (HB441_CD1) will become available for research and operations. This contrasts with the previous version, under which no new operating revenue would have been realized from this tax increase until after June 30, 2041 (HB441_CD1_CCR257_).",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "After the initial six-year period, the fiscal structure established by this measure is set to be permanent. Annually, revenue generated from 2.0 cents per cigarette (HB441_CD1) will be directed toward debt service and building maintenance for the cancer research center. The remaining revenue from the other 2.0 cents per cigarette (HB441_CD1) will provide a recurring source of funding for the center's research and operational needs.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The principal change from the previous version is the revision to the use-restriction for the increased tax revenue allocated to the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund. The period requiring the entire 4.0-cent per cigarette allocation (HB441_CD1) to be used exclusively for debt service and maintenance has been significantly shortened from June 30, 2041, to June 30, 2030 (HB441_CD1_CCR257_). A new provision has been added that, beginning July 1, 2030, reduces the restricted amount for debt service to 2.0 cents per cigarette (HB441_CD1), thereby allowing the remaining 2.0 cents per cigarette (HB441_CD1) to be used for research and operations."
