  "overview": "The measure has been amended to shorten the time frame during which all cigarette tax revenues in the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund are exclusively used for debt service and building maintenance, changing the end date from June 30, 2041, to June 30, 2030. A new provision specifies that beginning July 1, 2030, only the portion of the fund equivalent to two cents per cigarette will be restricted for these purposes. The bill's effective date is now December 31, 2025.",
  "appropriations": "The allocation structure has been revised to create a two-tiered system for the use of funds. The mandate restricting the entire Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund to debt service and building maintenance is now shortened to last only until June 30, 2030. After this date, the restriction is reduced, applying only to the revenue generated by two cents per cigarette, which provides future flexibility for the remaining funds.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "",
  "agency_impact": "The operational impact on the University of Hawai ªi Cancer Center is significantly altered, as the period during which the entire special fund is restricted is much shorter. The Center will regain access to a portion of the special fund's revenue for research or other operational purposes starting July 1, 2030, rather than having to wait until 2041. This change provides a clearer and sooner path to restoring funding for the Center's primary research mission.",
  "economic_impact": "",
  "policy_impact": "This version modifies the long-term policy by converting a single, extended restriction into a two-phase approach. The policy now involves a shorter-term, comprehensive restriction on the entire fund until 2030, followed by a sustained, partial restriction on a portion of the fund's revenue thereafter. This revised policy balances the immediate need for facility funding with the long-term goal of supporting cancer research activities.",
  "revenue_sources": "The allowable uses of the revenue have been updated with a new timeline. While the cigarette tax remains the source, the restriction on its use is now divided into two periods. All allocated revenues are restricted until June 30, 2030, after which only a portion of the revenue stream (equivalent to two cents per cigarette) remains dedicated to debt service and building maintenance.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The six-year fiscal outlook is revised by the change in the restriction period. While the fund's revenue will be entirely dedicated to debt service and building maintenance from January 1, 2026, through June 30, 2030, this version introduces fiscal flexibility starting in FY 31. From July 1, 2030, onward, the University of Hawaii will be able to direct revenues exceeding the two-cents-per-cigarette threshold toward other priorities. This is a significant change from the previous version, which locked the entire fund for the duration of the six-year outlook and beyond.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The fiscal obligations after six years are substantially different, with the full restriction on the special fund now ending on June 30, 2030. Beginning July 1, 2030, the ongoing fiscal structure changes, with only the revenue from two cents per cigarette dedicated to debt service and maintenance. This frees up the remaining portion of the special fund for other uses, such as research and operations, altering the long-term financial landscape for the Cancer Center.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The bill has been amended to become H.B. No. 441, H.D. 2, S.D. 2, C.D. 1. The primary update is the significant shortening of the restriction on the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund, moving the end date for the full restriction from June 30, 2041, to June 30, 2030. Additionally, a new provision has been added to specify that after this date, only a portion of the fund (two cents per cigarette) will remain dedicated to debt service and building maintenance."
