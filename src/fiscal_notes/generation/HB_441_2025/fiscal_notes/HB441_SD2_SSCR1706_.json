  "overview": "This measure increases the cigarette tax from sixteen to eighteen cents per cigarette, effective January 1, 2026 (HB441_SD2). The key change in this version is the disposition of tax revenues, which now allocates a total of 4.0 cents per cigarette directly to the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund (HB441_SD2). A new provision further requires that these funds be used exclusively for debt service of capital expenditures and building maintenance until June 30, 2041 (HB441_SD2).",
  "appropriations": "The amended disposition of revenues, effective after December 31, 2025, directs a total of 4.0 cents per cigarette to the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund (HB441_SD2). This consolidates the existing 2.0-cent allocation with the new 2.0-cent increase from this measure. Furthermore, a new restriction mandates that until June 30, 2041, the entirety of this 4.0-cent allocation must be used exclusively for debt service of capital expenditures and building maintenance (HB441_SD2).",

  "policy_impact": "This measure, amended into S.D. 2, alters the fiscal policy for the increased cigarette tax revenue (HB441_SD2_SSCR1706_). It redirects the new revenue from a direct payment to the University of Hawaii to a consolidated deposit into the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund, totaling 4.0 cents per cigarette (HB441_SD2). This version also introduces a new long-term policy by restricting the use of these funds specifically for debt service and building maintenance until June 30, 2041 (HB441_SD2).",

  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The primary change from the previous version is the mechanism for allocating the new tax revenue. Instead of creating a new, separate distribution to the University of Hawaii for debt service, the bill now consolidates the 2-cent increase with the existing 2-cent allocation. This results in a total of 4.0 cents per cigarette being deposited directly into the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund (HB441_SD2). A significant new restriction has been added, mandating that this entire 4.0-cent allocation be used exclusively for debt service of capital expenditures and building maintenance until June 30, 2041 (HB441_SD2)."
