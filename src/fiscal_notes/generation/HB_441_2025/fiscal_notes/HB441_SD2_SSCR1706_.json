  "overview": "The measure has been amended to specify that the increased tax revenue will be deposited directly into the Hawaii cancer research special fund, resolving a previously noted ambiguity. A significant new provision has been added, requiring that until June 30, 2041, all cigarette tax revenues allocated to this fund be used exclusively for debt service on capital expenditures and building maintenance. This creates a long-term restriction on the use of the entire special fund, not just the new revenue.",
  "appropriations": "The allocation of the increased tax revenue is now more defined, with funds being deposited directly into the Hawaii cancer research special fund. A new, long-term mandate requires that until June 30, 2041, all revenues in this fund be used exclusively for debt service and building maintenance. This expands the intended use to include building maintenance but also restricts the use of the entire fund for nearly two decades.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "",
  "agency_impact": "The impact on the University of Hawai ªi Cancer Center is now more specific, as the dedicated special fund revenue stream must be used for both debt service and building maintenance until 2041. This provides a secure source of funding for the facility's upkeep but restricts the Center's ability to use these funds for other operational or research purposes during this period. The change prioritizes the physical infrastructure's financial stability.",
  "economic_impact": "",
  "policy_impact": "The measure introduces a significant, long-term policy change by dedicating the entire revenue stream of the Hawaii cancer research special fund exclusively to debt service and building maintenance until June 30, 2041. This shifts the fund's purpose away from general research and operations, prioritizing the financial solvency and physical upkeep of the Cancer Research Center's infrastructure for a fixed period. This sets a long-term fiscal precedent for this specific revenue source.",
  "revenue_sources": "While the revenue source remains the cigarette tax, the allowable uses for the portion directed to the Hawaii cancer research special fund have been amended. The funds must now be used for both debt service and building maintenance. This restriction applies to the entire allocation to the special fund, not just the revenue from the new 2-cent tax increase.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The fiscal outlook for the Hawaii cancer research special fund is now more constrained for the next six years and beyond. The entirety of the fund's revenue, including the new increase, is legally restricted to debt service and building maintenance until 2041. This eliminates any fiscal flexibility for the University of Hawaii to direct these funds toward other research or operational priorities that may arise during this period.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The measure now explicitly expands the use of the dedicated funds to include building maintenance in addition to servicing debt on the past capital project. This provides a revenue stream for the ongoing upkeep of the Cancer Research Center facility. This clarification establishes building maintenance as an approved, long-term expenditure for this fund until 2041.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The bill now contains explicit fiscal implications extending well beyond the six-year outlook, lasting until June 30, 2041. Throughout this period, all revenue deposited into the Hawaii cancer research special fund will remain exclusively dedicated to debt service and building maintenance. This creates a long-term, mandated fiscal structure for the fund, ensuring its use for capital-related obligations for nearly two decades.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The bill has been amended to become H.B. No. 441, S.D. 2. The key change is the addition of a long-term restriction on the use of funds: until June 30, 2041, all cigarette tax revenue allocated to the Hawaii cancer research special fund must be used exclusively for debt service and building maintenance. This amendment also clarifies that the revenue is to be deposited directly into the special fund, resolving a technical issue from the previous version."
