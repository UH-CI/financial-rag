Your Committees received comments on this
measure from the Department of Taxation, Tax Foundation of Hawaii, Tax
Foundation, and Tobacco Harm Reduction 101
.
Your Committees
find that cigarette smoking persists as the leading cause of preventable death
nationally and is linked to heart disease, cancer, and stroke, which were also
the leading causes of death in the State in 2021.
Your Committees further find that the World
Health Organization recommends that tobacco taxes should be raised
significantly and at regular intervals to ensure that tobacco products do not
become more affordable.
Your Committees
note that the last cigarette tax increase in the State was fourteen years ago
in 2011.
This measure increases the
excise tax on cigarettes and little cigars as a proven public health policy to
prevent youth from starting and incentivize adults to quit smoking.
Your Committees have
amended this measure by:
(1)
Deleting its contents and inserting
the
language
from
S.B. No.
1528,
S.D. 1 (2025), a
substantively similar
measure
previously passed by your Committees that, beginning January 1, 2026:
(A)
Increases
the cigarette tax from sixteen cents to eighteen cents; and
(B)
Amends
the disposition of cigarette tax revenues by allocating the increase in the
cigarette tax amount to the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund; and
(2)
Amending the
disposition of cigarette tax revenues by allocating the increase in the
cigarette tax amount to be deposited with the Director of Finance to be payable
to the University of Hawaii for the purposes of debt reduction for the Cancer Research
Center of Hawaii
.
As affirmed by the
records of votes of the members of your Committees on Health and Human Services
and Higher Education that are attached to this report, your Committees are in
accord with the intent and purpose of H.B. No. 441, H.D. 2, as amended
herein, and recommend that it pass Second Reading in the form attached hereto
as H.B. No. 441, H.D. 2, S.D. 1, and be referred to your
Committee on Ways and Means.
Respectfully submitted on behalf
of the members of the Committees on Health and Human Services and Higher
