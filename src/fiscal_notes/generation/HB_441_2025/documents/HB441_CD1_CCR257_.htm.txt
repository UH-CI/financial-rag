Conference has amended this measure by:
(1)
Specifying that all cigarette tax revenues
allocated to the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund be used exclusively for
debt service of capital expenditures and building maintenance until June 30,
2030, rather than June 30, 2041;

Requiring that, beginning July 1, 2030, of
each amount deposited into the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund, two cents
per cigarette shall be used exclusively for debt service of capital
expenditures and building maintenance;

Changing the effective date to December 31,
2025; and
(4)
Making technical, nonsubstantive amendments
for the purposes of clarity, consistency, and style.
