RE:
H.B. No. 441
H.D. 2
S.D. 2
Honorable Ronald D. Kouchi
President of the Senate
Thirty-Third State Legislature
Regular Session of 2025
State of Hawaii
Sir:
Your Committee on
Ways and Means, to which was referred H.B. No. 441, H.D. 2,
S.D. 1, entitled:
"A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO CIGARETTE
TAXES,"
begs leave to report as follows:
The
purpose and intent of this measure is to amend statutory provisions relating to
taxes on tobacco products.
More
specifically, this measure:
(1)
Increases the tax on each cigarette or little
cigar that is sold, used, or possessed by a wholesaler or dealer; and
(2)
Allocates the increase in tax revenues for debt
reduction for the Cancer Research Center of Hawaii.
Your Committee
received written comments in support of this measure from the Department of the
Attorney General, Department of Health, State Health Planning and Development
Agency, University of Hawaii System, Coalition for a Tobacco-Free Hawaii Youth
Council, Hawaii COPD Coalition, Hawaii Medical Association, Hawaii Pacific
Health, Hawaii Public Health Institute, Hawaii Substance Abuse Coalition, The
Queen's Health Systems, and twelve individuals.
Your Committee
received written comments in opposition to this measure from the Cigar
Association of America and Retail Merchants of Hawaii.
Your Committee
received written comments on this measure from the Department of Taxation and American
Cancer Society Cancer Action Network.
Your Committee
finds that a portion of the cigarette tax revenues currently allocated to the
Hawaii cancer research special fund is specifically pledged towards revenue
bonds sold to construct the Cancer Research Center of Hawaii in 2010, conduct
cancer research, and fund the Center's operations.
Your Committee also finds that plummeting cigarette
tax revenues have jeopardized the revenue stream for debt service for the
revenue bonds and diminishes the availability of resources for the Cancer
Research Center of Hawaii to deliver cutting-edge cancer treatments to the
State's cancer patients.
Your Committee has
amended this measure by:
(1)
Specifying that the increased tax revenues be
deposited into the Hawaii cancer research special fund; and
(2)
Requiring that, until June 30, 2041, all
cigarette tax revenues allocated to the Hawaii cancer research special fund be
used exclusively for debt service of capital expenditures and building
maintenance.
As affirmed by the
record of votes of the members of your Committee on Ways and Means that is
attached to this report, your Committee is in accord with the intent and
purpose of H.B. No. 441, H.D. 2, S.D. 1, as amended herein, and
recommends that it pass Third Reading in the form attached hereto as H.B.
No. 441, H.D. 2, S.D. 2.
Respectfully submitted on behalf of the members of the Committee
on Ways and Means,
