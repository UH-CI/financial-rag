RE:
H.B. No. 3
H.D.
1
Honorable Nadine K. Nakamura
Speaker, House of Representatives
Thirty-Third State Legislature
Regular Session of 2025
State of Hawaii
Madame:
Your Committee on Higher
Education, to which was referred H.B. No. 3, H.D. 1, entitled:
"A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO BEACH MANAGEMENT ON
THE NORTH SHORE OF OAHU,"
begs leave to report as follows:
The
purpose of this measure is to extend the deadline for the University of Hawaii
Sea Grant College Program to submit the North Shore Beach Management Plan to
the Governor and Legislature.
Your Committee received testimony in support of this measure
from the Department of Land and Natural Resources; University of Hawai
Ê»
i
Sea Grant College Program; and Climate Resilience Collaborative.
Your Committee finds that Act 226, Session Laws of Hawaii 2024,
required the University of Hawaii Sea Grant College Program to submit a beach
management plan for Oahu's North Shore by December 1, 2025.
Your Committee recognizes that completion of
the beach management plan by the existing deadline will be challenging and
believes that extending this deadline to December 1, 2026, will provide the
University of Hawaii Sea Grant College Program sufficient time for community
engagement and outreach as part of the plan.
As affirmed by the
record of votes of the members of your Committee on Higher Education that is
attached to this report, your Committee is in accord with the intent and
purpose of H.B. No. 3, H.D. 1, and recommends that it be referred to your
Committee on Finance.
Respectfully
submitted on behalf of the members of the Committee on Higher Education,
