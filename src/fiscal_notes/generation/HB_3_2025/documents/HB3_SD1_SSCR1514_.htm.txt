Sir:
Your Committee on
Ways and Means, to which was referred H.B. No. 3, H.D. 2,
S.D. 1, entitled:
"A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO BEACH MANAGEMENT ON
THE NORTH SHORE OF OAHU,"
begs leave to report as follows:
The
purpose and intent of this measure is to extend by one year the deadline for
the University of Hawaii Sea Grant College Program to submit the North Shore
Beach Management Plan to the Governor and the Legislature.
Your Committee
received written comments in support of this measure from the Department of
Land and Natural Resources and University of Hawaii System.
Your Committee finds
that the North Shore Beach Management Plan promises to be an important coastal
management, adaptation planning, and community engagement model for other
communities struggling with coastal hazards and sea-level rise.
Your Committee further finds that extending
the deadline for submission of the plan to the Governor and the Legislature
will provide additional time to ensure meaningful community engagement and
outreach.
As affirmed by the
record of votes of the members of your Committee on Ways and Means that is
attached to this report, your Committee is in accord with the intent and
purpose of H.B. No. 3, H.D. 2, S.D. 1, and recommends that it
pass Third Reading.
Respectfully submitted on behalf
of the members of the Committee on Ways and Means,
