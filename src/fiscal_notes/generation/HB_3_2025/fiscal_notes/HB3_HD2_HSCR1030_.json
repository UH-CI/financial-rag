  "overview": "This measure has been amended to include a significant fiscal component beyond simply extending a deadline. It now prevents the appropriation for the North Shore Beach Management Plan from lapsing, extending the funds' availability until June 30, 2026. This ensures the University of Hawaii Sea Grant College Program has the necessary financial resources to complete the plan within the new timeframe.",
  "appropriations": "While this measure does not provide new funding, it directly impacts a prior appropriation from Act 226, SLH 2024. By extending the lapse date, it ensures that unencumbered funds designated for the North Shore Beach Management Plan remain available for expenditure in fiscal year 2026. This prevents the funds from returning to the general fund at the end of fiscal year 2025.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal analysis is now based on the amendment specified in House Standing Committee Report 1030, which incorporates a non-lapsing provision. It is assumed that without this change, the project's funding would expire on June 30, 2025, halting progress. Therefore, the fiscal impact is the preservation of the existing appropriation for its intended purpose in the subsequent fiscal year.",
  "agency_impact": "This measure now has a direct positive fiscal impact on the University of Hawaiâ€˜i Sea Grant College Program. The non-lapsing provision provides budgetary stability and ensures the agency can retain and expend its allocated funds to meet the extended project deadline. This change prevents operational disruptions that would occur if the funding lapsed.",
  "economic_impact": "",
  "policy_impact": "The measure now carries fiscal policy implications by establishing a legislative mechanism to align an appropriation's lapse date with a revised project timeline. This action ensures that the original legislative intent of funding the beach management plan is fulfilled despite project delays. It modifies the standard fiscal procedure by authorizing funds to be carried over into a new fiscal year.",
  "revenue_sources": "",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The primary fiscal implication within the six-year period is the carryover of previously appropriated funds from FY 2025 to FY 2026. This measure ensures funds intended for the North Shore Beach Management Plan, which would have otherwise lapsed to the general fund on June 30, 2025, are instead expended in FY 2026. This represents a commitment of funds in FY 2026 that would have been unallocated.",

  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The primary change from the previous fiscal note is the reintroduction of a direct fiscal impact. The prior version of the bill was described as a purely administrative measure with no fiscal provisions. As amended and reflected in HSCR 1030, the bill now includes a non-lapsing provision that extends the appropriation lapse date to June 30, 2026, ensuring the project's funding is preserved."
