  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "This fiscal note confirms the analysis of the previous version, as the bill's substance has not changed. The current measure, H.B. No. 3, H.D. 2, S.D. 1, remains purely administrative, solely extending the submission deadline for the North Shore Beach Management Plan. As confirmed by recent testimony and the latest committee report, the bill contains no appropriation and does not alter the lapsing date of previously allocated funds, resulting in no direct fiscal impact."
