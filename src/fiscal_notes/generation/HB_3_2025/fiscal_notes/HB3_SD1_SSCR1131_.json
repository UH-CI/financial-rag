  "overview": "This measure has been amended to remove the non-lapsing provision for funds, reverting its purpose to solely extending the submission deadline for the North Shore Beach Management Plan to December 1, 2026. A defective effective date of July 31, 2050, has also been inserted to encourage further discussion on the matter. The bill no longer contains a direct fiscal component.",
  "appropriations": "In contrast to the previous version, this measure no longer prevents the appropriation from Act 226, SLH 2024, from lapsing. As a result, any unexpended funds for the North Shore Beach Management Plan will lapse on June 30, 2025, as per standard fiscal procedure. This bill now has no direct impact on any appropriation.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal analysis is now based on the version of the bill described in Standing Committee Report 1131, which removes the non-lapsing clause. It is assumed the measure is purely administrative, affecting only a project deadline. The primary financial assumption is that existing funds will lapse and a new appropriation will be needed in a future session to complete the project.",
  "agency_impact": "The positive budgetary impact for the University of Hawai ªi Sea Grant College Program has been removed. Without the non-lapsing provision, the agency faces the significant risk that its funding will expire before the newly extended project deadline. This change introduces operational and fiscal uncertainty regarding the completion of the management plan.",
  "economic_impact": "",
  "policy_impact": "This measure's policy impact has been significantly altered by removing the provision that aligned the project's funding period with its extended timeline. This creates a misalignment between the administrative deadline and the fiscal authority to spend. It may inadvertently undermine the original legislative intent to see the plan completed by not providing the necessary financial continuity.",
  "revenue_sources": "",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The previously anticipated carryover of funds from FY 2025 to FY 2026 is no longer a factor, as this measure now has no direct fiscal implications within the six-year period. This version of the bill removes the mechanism that guaranteed funding continuity for the North Shore Beach Management Plan into FY 2026. The existing appropriation from Act 226, SLH 2024, is now expected to lapse at the end of FY 2025. Consequently, a new appropriation will likely be required in the FY 2026 budget to allow the project to be completed by its new deadline. This effectively shifts the financial commitment to a future legislative session rather than ensuring the use of already allocated funds.",

  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The principal change from the prior fiscal note is the removal of the non-lapsing appropriation provision, which had been the basis for the bill's fiscal impact. That provision, which extended the availability of funds to June 30, 2026, has been replaced with a defective effective date of July 31, 2050. Consequently, the bill has reverted from a measure with a direct positive fiscal impact to one that is purely administrative and has no immediate fiscal effect."
