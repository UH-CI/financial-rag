  "overview": "This measure has been amended to insert a defective effective date of July 31, 2050. While the bill's intent to extend the North Shore Beach Management Plan deadline to December 1, 2026, and its associated funding remains, the new effective date ensures the measure will not become law as currently written. This amendment was made to encourage further discussion on the measure.",
  "appropriations": "The provision to extend the lapse date of funds to June 30, 2026, is now rendered ineffective by the defective effective date. As a result, any unencumbered funds appropriated under Act 226, Session Laws of Hawai'i 2024, will lapse as originally scheduled on June 30, 2025. This version of the measure therefore provides no appropriation or extension of funds.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal analysis is now based on the insertion of a defective effective date of July 31, 2050. This primary assumption means the bill will have no fiscal impact in its current form, as none of its provisions will be implemented. This negates the previous assumption that appropriated funds would be available for expenditure in FY 2026.",
  "agency_impact": "This version of the measure eliminates the budgetary certainty that the previous draft provided to the University of Hawai'i. With the defective effective date, the appropriation for the project will lapse, leaving the university without the necessary funding to complete the plan during the extended timeline. This reintroduces the administrative and budgetary challenges the prior draft had resolved.",
  "economic_impact": "",
  "policy_impact": "The primary policy change in this draft is procedural, not substantive, through the insertion of a defective effective date. This action renders the bill's intended policy—to align a project deadline with its funding timeline—ineffective. The measure now serves as a vehicle for future negotiations rather than an implementable law.",
  "revenue_sources": "",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "This amended measure now has no fiscal implications, which is a significant change from the previous draft. The insertion of a defective effective date of July 31, 2050, means the provision extending the appropriation lapse date will not take effect. Therefore, funds from Act 226, SLH 2024, will not be carried over from FY 2025 to FY 2026. The state's financial plan is not impacted by this version of the bill, as all unspent funds will revert to the general fund on June 30, 2025, as originally scheduled.",

  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The defining change from the previous fiscal note is the insertion of a defective effective date of July 31, 2050. While House Draft 2 had a direct fiscal impact by making funds available in FY 2026, Senate Draft 1 has no fiscal impact because it cannot be enacted as written. This amendment nullifies the bill's fiscal provisions and reverts its status to having no effect on state expenditures."
