  "overview": "House Bill 3, House Draft 1, extends the submission deadline for the University of Hawai'i Sea Grant College Program's North Shore Beach Management Plan to December 1, 2026. This extension is intended to provide sufficient time for necessary community engagement and outreach. The measure is supported by the University of Hawai'i and the Department of Land and Natural Resources as a way to ensure a more thorough and community-focused plan.",
  "appropriations": "This measure does not contain an appropriation. In contrast to the version described in the previous fiscal note, House Draft 1 does not include a non-lapsing provision for funds previously appropriated under Act 226, Session Laws of Hawai'i 2024. As currently written, the bill has no direct impact on state funds.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal analysis is based on the text of House Draft 1, which solely contains a deadline extension. The primary assumption is that this measure has no direct fiscal impact because it lacks any language related to appropriations or funding. This differs from the previous analysis, which was predicated on the inclusion of a non-lapsing provision to preserve project funds.",
  "agency_impact": "This measure provides an administrative benefit to the University of Hawai'i by extending the project timeline, which allows for more comprehensive community outreach. Unlike the previously noted version, this draft does not address the potential budgetary risk of lapsing funds. The impact is therefore limited to an adjustment in the project's reporting schedule rather than its budget.",
  "economic_impact": "",
  "policy_impact": "This bill enacts a minor administrative policy adjustment by extending a statutory deadline. It removes the significant policy changes noted previously, such as the creation of a non-lapsing fund and the procedural amendment setting the effective date to July 1, 3000. The measure's policy scope is now narrowly focused on facilitating the completion of the North Shore Beach Management Plan.",
  "revenue_sources": "",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "This measure, in its current form as House Draft 1, carries no direct fiscal implications over the six-year planning period. It does not appropriate new funds nor does it contain language to prevent the lapsing of funds previously allocated by Act 226, SLH 2024. Therefore, there are no projected costs, staffing changes, or recurring expenses associated with this bill. The analysis in the previous fiscal note, which projected a fiscal impact in FY 2026 due to a non-lapsing provision, is no longer applicable. That provision would have ensured funds appropriated in FY 2025 remained available for expenditure in FY 2026. Without this language, any unexpended funds from Act 226 will lapse as regularly scheduled on June 30, 2025. The bill's sole function is now an administrative deadline extension. There are no assumptions about program expansion or permanence tied to this measure. The six-year expenditure outlook for the state remains unchanged by this bill. This is a significant departure from the previous version which actively preserved funding into a future fiscal year.",

  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The most significant change from the previous fiscal note is the removal of key fiscal and procedural amendments from the bill. House Draft 1, as described in recent testimony and committee reports, is a straightforward deadline extension and no longer includes the non-lapsing provision that was intended to preserve project funding from Act 226. Furthermore, the procedural amendment changing the bill's effective date to July 1, 3000, is not present, reverting the bill to a simple measure with no immediate fiscal impact."
