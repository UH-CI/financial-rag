  "overview": "This measure extends the deadline for the University of Hawai‘i Sea Grant College Program to submit the North Shore Beach Management Plan to the governor and legislature by one year, to December 1, 2026. This extension is intended to provide the program with sufficient time for community engagement and outreach as part of the plan's development. The bill itself does not introduce new programs or requirements beyond this administrative timeline adjustment.",
  "appropriations": "This measure, as described in the provided documents, does not appropriate any new funds. It is a non-fiscal bill that only amends a reporting deadline for a project previously funded under Act 226, Session Laws of Hawaiʻi 2024. Therefore, it has no impact on state appropriations.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "This fiscal note is based on the provided testimony and committee report for HB3 HD1, which characterize the measure as a simple deadline extension. It is assumed that this bill is purely administrative and does not alter the funding mechanisms or amounts established in prior legislation. The analysis concludes there are no new expenditures of state funds associated with this measure.",
  "agency_impact": "The measure provides an operational benefit to the University of Hawai‘i Sea Grant College Program by allowing more time to complete the North Shore Beach Management Plan. This extension supports the agency's ability to conduct thorough community outreach without imposing new administrative or budgetary burdens. There are no direct fiscal impacts on the agency as a result of this bill.",
  "economic_impact": "This measure has no direct economic impact, as it only extends a project deadline. The successful completion of the North Shore Beach Management Plan, which this bill facilitates, may lead to long-term economic benefits by promoting coastal resilience and mitigating future costs associated with sea-level rise. However, these effects are not a direct result of this specific bill.",
  "policy_impact": "The policy impact of this measure is limited to amending the statutory deadline set by Act 226, Session Laws of Hawaiʻi 2024. It does not change the scope or intent of the original legislation requiring the development of the North Shore Beach Management Plan. The measure reinforces the policy of ensuring community-focused planning in state projects by allowing adequate time for public engagement.",
  "revenue_sources": "This measure does not create, modify, or otherwise affect any state revenue sources. The project discussed is funded by a prior appropriation. No new revenue is generated or required by this bill.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "This bill has no direct fiscal implications over the six-year financial planning period. It is an administrative measure that does not authorize any new expenditures or appropriate any funds. The costs associated with developing the North Shore Beach Management Plan are contained within the original appropriation from Act 226, SLH 2024, and are not affected by this deadline extension.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "This measure has no impact on state or agency operating revenues.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "This measure has no impact on capital expenditures.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "There are no ongoing fiscal implications from this measure after the six-year period.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The primary change from the previous fiscal note is the removal of all fiscal provisions. The previous note analyzed a version of the measure that included a non-lapsing provision for funds, which had a direct fiscal impact by preventing an appropriation from expiring. The current version of the bill as described in the provided documents, HB3 HD1, is a purely administrative deadline extension with no appropriation or non-lapsing language, and therefore has no direct fiscal impact."
