  "overview": "This measure extends the deadline for the University of Hawaii Sea Grant College Program to submit its North Shore Beach Management Plan to the Governor and Legislature to December 1, 2026. It also extends the appropriation lapse date for the funds allocated to develop this plan to June 30, 2026. The measure's effective date is June 30, 2025.",
  "appropriations": "This bill does not contain a new appropriation. Instead, it extends the lapse date of a previously enacted appropriation for the University of Hawaii Sea Grant College Program. This action allows the program to continue utilizing existing funds for the development of the North Shore Beach Management Plan until June 30, 2026.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal analysis is based on the assumption that without this measure, the existing unexpended funds for the project would lapse at the end of the current fiscal year and revert to the general fund. By extending the lapse date, the measure makes these funds available for expenditure in fiscal year 2026. The methodology, therefore, recognizes a fiscal impact by shifting the availability of funds rather than appropriating new ones.",
  "agency_impact": "The measure enables the University of Hawaii Sea Grant College Program to complete the North Shore Beach Management Plan without interruption. It prevents the loss of funding for an ongoing project, thereby avoiding administrative and operational disruptions. No additional staffing or resources are required, as the bill simply provides more time to utilize existing allocations.",
  "economic_impact": "By facilitating the completion of the North Shore Beach Management Plan, this measure supports long-term efforts to protect coastal infrastructure and property on Oahu's North Shore from erosion and sea-level rise. While there are no immediate direct economic effects, the finished plan is expected to guide policies that provide future economic benefits by mitigating coastal hazards. This ensures the continued viability of a vital economic and recreational area.",
  "policy_impact": "This measure amends the original act that established the North Shore Beach Management Plan by modifying its timeline for completion and funding availability. It reaffirms the Legislature's policy commitment to developing a comprehensive strategy for coastal resilience. The extensions reflect an adjustment to accommodate the complexities of the project while ensuring its ultimate completion.",
  "revenue_sources": "This measure does not authorize or create any new revenue sources. The funding for the North Shore Beach Management Plan is derived from a prior general fund appropriation. This bill's purpose is solely to extend the period during which those previously appropriated funds can be spent.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The primary fiscal implication occurs in fiscal year 2026. This measure prevents a prior appropriation from lapsing at the end of fiscal year 2025, thus making those funds available for expenditure in FY26. Consequently, expenditures that would not have otherwise occurred will be recorded in FY26. There are no new costs or appropriations associated with this bill over the six-year period. The financial impact is confined to allowing the expenditure of existing funds within a new timeframe. After the new lapse date of June 30, 2026, there are no further fiscal implications from this specific appropriation.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "This measure has no impact on state operating revenues. It does not introduce any new taxes, fees, or other revenue-generating mechanisms. Its scope is limited to extending the expenditure timeline for an existing appropriation.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "There are no capital expenditures associated with this measure. The funds are designated for the development of a management plan, which involves research, analysis, and planning activities. No facility construction or major equipment purchases are authorized.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "There are no ongoing fiscal implications beyond the six-year planning period. The appropriation for the management plan is scheduled to lapse on June 30, 2026. Any future implementation of the plan's recommendations would require separate, new appropriations.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The previous fiscal note for H.B. No. 3, H.D. 2, S.D. 1 stated the measure had no fiscal impact because it only extended the plan's submission deadline and did not alter the appropriation's lapsing date. This new version, H.B. No. 3, H.D. 2, S.D. 1, C.D. 1, introduces a significant change by now also extending the appropriation lapse date to June 30, 2026. This creates a fiscal impact by preventing previously allocated funds from reverting to the general fund and making them available for expenditure in a future fiscal year."
