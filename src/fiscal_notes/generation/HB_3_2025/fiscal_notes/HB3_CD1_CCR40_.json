  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "This fiscal note is based on the final conference draft of the measure, which formalizes the bill's intent and sets a definitive effective date of June 30, 2025. The core components, including the extension of the North Shore Beach Management Plan submission deadline to December 1, 2026, and the appropriation lapse date to June 30, 2026, remain unchanged from the previous analysis. Consequently, the fiscal impact of re-timing expenditures from FY 2025 to FY 2026 is confirmed, and no other substantive changes are noted."
