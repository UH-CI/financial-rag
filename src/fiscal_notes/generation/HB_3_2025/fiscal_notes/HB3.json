  "overview": "This measure extends the deadline for the University of Hawaii Sea Grant College to submit the North Shore Beach Management Plan to the Governor and Legislature, as originally mandated by Act 226, Session Laws of Hawaii 2024. The extension is intended to provide the Sea Grant College with additional time to conduct necessary community engagement and outreach. The ultimate goal is to develop a community-focused coastal management and adaptation plan to address coastal erosion on Oahu's north shore.",
  "appropriations": "This measure does not appropriate any funds. It solely addresses the extension of a reporting deadline for a plan mandated by previous legislation. Therefore, no new funding for staffing, training, or other expenses is specified.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "No financial projections are included in this measure, as it does not involve any expenditure of funds. Consequently, there are no underlying assumptions or methodologies to report. The bill's focus is on amending a statutory deadline, not on fiscal matters.",
  "agency_impact": "The primary impact of this measure is on the University of Hawaii Sea Grant College, which will be granted an extended deadline to complete its work. This extension is anticipated to allow the agency more time to conduct community outreach for the North Shore Beach Management Plan. The measure does not specify any other operational, administrative, or budgetary changes for the agency.",
  "economic_impact": "This measure, which extends a planning deadline, has no direct economic impact. The underlying North Shore Beach Management Plan, once completed and implemented, is intended to address coastal erosion, which could have significant long-term economic benefits. However, this bill itself does not generate cost savings or other direct economic effects.",
  "policy_impact": "The measure amends Act 226, Session Laws of Hawaii 2024, by modifying the submission deadline for the North Shore Beach Management Plan. This change reflects a policy emphasis on allowing sufficient time for community-focused engagement in developing coastal management strategies. It reinforces the state's approach to collaborative and well-researched environmental planning.",
  "revenue_sources": "No revenue sources are identified or required by this measure. The bill does not authorize the collection of fees or allocate funds from any specific source. Any funding for the development of the North Shore Beach Management Plan would have been addressed in separate legislation.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "This measure has no direct fiscal implications over the next six years. It does not appropriate funds, authorize expenditures, or create new positions. The costs associated with developing the North Shore Beach Management Plan are related to the original mandate in Act 226, SLH 2024, not this deadline extension. Therefore, there are no projected costs, recurring expenses, or staffing changes resulting from this bill. The bill simply provides additional time for the University of Hawaii Sea Grant College to complete its existing responsibilities without altering the scope or cost of the underlying project.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "This measure is not expected to have any impact on the state's operating revenues. It does not introduce any new fees, fines, or other revenue-generating mechanisms. The bill's scope is limited to a deadline extension for a report.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "This measure does not authorize or require any capital expenditures. There are no anticipated costs for facilities, equipment, or technology infrastructure resulting from this bill. It is purely an administrative measure to extend a deadline.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "This measure has no long-term fiscal implications beyond the six-year outlook. As it is a non-fiscal bill that only extends a reporting deadline, it does not create any ongoing financial obligations for the state. Any future costs would be associated with the implementation of the management plan itself, which would require separate legislative action.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "No previous fiscal note was provided for comparison."
