  "overview": "",
  "appropriations": "This measure has been amended to include a non-lapsing provision for the funds originally appropriated by Act 226, Session Laws of Hawaiʻi 2024. This provision ensures the appropriated moneys do not lapse at the end of the current fiscal year on June 30, 2025. Any unencumbered funds will now lapse on June 30, 2026, aligning the funding availability with the newly proposed project deadline.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The financial analysis now assumes that without this measure's non-lapsing provision, the funds allocated for the North Shore Beach Management Plan would revert to the general fund on June 30, 2025. This would effectively defund the project before its completion. The methodology is a legislative amendment to prevent this lapse and preserve the existing appropriation for its intended purpose.",
  "agency_impact": "The budgetary impact on the University of Hawai‘i Sea Grant College Program is now significant. The proposed non-lapsing provision is critical for the agency to retain the necessary funding to complete the North Shore Beach Management Plan. Without this amendment, the extension of the deadline would be ineffective as the financial resources would be lost at the end of the fiscal year.",
  "economic_impact": "",
  "policy_impact": "The measure's policy implications have expanded to include fiscal management for state-funded projects. By adding a non-lapsing clause, the bill now addresses the practical challenge of multi-year projects that straddle fiscal years. This change establishes a mechanism to ensure legislative intent regarding funding is fulfilled despite administrative or project-based delays.",
  "revenue_sources": "",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "This measure now has a direct, though non-additive, fiscal implication. It prevents previously appropriated funds from lapsing, ensuring their availability for expenditure in Fiscal Year 2026. While no new funds are appropriated, this action retains funding for the North Shore Beach Management Plan that would otherwise have reverted to the general fund on June 30, 2025. The updated provision specifies that any unencumbered funds will lapse on June 30, 2026, creating a clear financial timeline for the project's completion.",

  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The primary update from the previous fiscal note is the introduction of a non-lapsing provision for funds previously appropriated for the North Shore Beach Management Plan under Act 226, SLH 2024. The original measure was purely a deadline extension with no fiscal impact. The current version now has a direct fiscal effect by ensuring these funds do not lapse on June 30, 2025, but remain available until June 30, 2026, thereby preventing the project from being unintentionally defunded."
