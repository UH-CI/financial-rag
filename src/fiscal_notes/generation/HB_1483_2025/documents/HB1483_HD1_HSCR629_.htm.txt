RE:
H.B. No. 1483
H.D.
1
Honorable Nadine K. Nakamura
Speaker, House of Representatives
Thirty-Third State Legislature
Regular Session of 2025
State of Hawaii
Madame:
Your Committee on
Judiciary & Hawaiian Affairs, to which was referred H.B. No. 1483 entitled:
"A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO FIREWORKS,"
begs leave to report as follows:
The
purpose of this measure is to:
(1)
Establish an
adjudication system and procedures to process fireworks infractions;
(2)
Amend and establish
various definitions and penalties for fireworks offenses, including
establishing heightened penalties under certain circumstances;
(3)
Establish various
criminal offenses and penalties related to fireworks or articles pyrotechnics;
and
(4)
Appropriate funds.
Your Committee received testimony in support of this measure
from the Department of Law Enforcement; Department of the Attorney General;
Honolulu Police Department; Hawaiian Humane Society; Animal Interfaith Alliance
in Britain; and numerous individuals.
Your Committee received testimony in
opposition to this measure from Hawaii Pyrotechnics and Explosives LLC;
Libertarian Party of Hawaii; and three individuals.
Your Committee
finds that it has been difficult for state and county agencies to enforce or
prosecute illegal fireworks cases in the State due to challenges with gathering
evidence, meeting the high burden of proof necessary for convictions, and
stringent definitions.
This measure
would largely address the concerns raised by prosecutors and provide greater
clarity and efficiency for law enforcement, prosecutors, and the courts.
Your
Committee has amended this measure by:
(1)
Amending
the offense of general fireworks or articles pyrotechnic prohibitions in the
second degree to:
(A)
Include
throwing, catapulting, or otherwise manually propelling ignited aerial devices,
articles pyrotechnics, consumer fireworks, or display fireworks; and
(B)
Clarify
when the state of mind requirement is not applicable;
(2)
Clarifying
the definitions of "aerial device", "consumer fireworks",
and "fireworks";
(3)
Clarifying
the weight thresholds for certain penalties for fireworks offenses;
(4)
Restoring
the authority of law enforcement officers to conduct inspections to verify
compliance with fireworks laws;
(5)
Changing the effective date to July 1, 3000, to encourage
further discussion
; and
(6)
Making
technical, nonsubstantive amendments for the purposes of clarity, consistency,
and style.
As affirmed by the
record of votes of the members of your Committee on Judiciary & Hawaiian
Affairs that is attached to this report, your Committee is in accord with the
intent and purpose of H.B. No. 1483, as amended herein, and recommends that it
pass Second Reading in the form attached hereto as H.B. No. 1483, H.D. 1, and
be referred to your Committee on Finance.
Respectfully
submitted on behalf of the members of the Committee on Judiciary & Hawaiian
Affairs,
