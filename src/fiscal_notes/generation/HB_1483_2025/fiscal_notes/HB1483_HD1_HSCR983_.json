  "overview": "This bill aims to improve fireworks law enforcement by creating an adjudication system for infractions, amending definitions, and establishing new criminal offenses with stricter penalties. It addresses historical difficulties in prosecuting illegal fireworks cases cited by state and county agencies. The measure also appropriates funds to the Judiciary to support the implementation of these new procedures.",
  "appropriations": "The bill appropriates an unspecified amount of funds to the Judiciary to establish the new adjudication system and procedures for fireworks infractions (HB1483_HD1_HSCR983_). According to the Department of Law Enforcement, this funding is considered crucial for implementing the new system and supporting the necessary enforcement infrastructure (HB1483_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_). The provided documents do not specify the amount or the fiscal years covered by the appropriation.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The provided documents do not contain information on the assumptions, cost estimation methods, or data sources used to calculate the financial projections for this measure.",
  "agency_impact": "The Department of Law Enforcement, Honolulu Police Department, and Department of the Attorney General testified that the bill will provide greater clarity and efficiency for law enforcement, prosecutors, and the courts (HB1483_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_). The Department of the Attorney General also submitted specific amendments to further clarify legal language for permit holders, license holders, and the definition of \"inspector\" to avoid unintentional operational conflicts (HB1483_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_). This indicates that while supportive, key agencies see a need for further refinement to ensure effective implementation.",
  "economic_impact": "Testimony from fireworks distributors, including TNT Fireworks and Phantom Fireworks, indicates the bill's restrictions on consumer fireworks could negatively impact law-abiding businesses (HB1483_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_). Hawaii Explosives & Pyrotechnics, Inc., a professional display company, warned that the bill's current language could prohibit most permitted commercial displays, such as the weekly Waikiki Friday Night Fireworks and shows at hotels or resorts (HB1483_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_). These testimonies suggest the measure may have unintended economic consequences for the legal fireworks and entertainment industries (HB1483_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_).",
  "policy_impact": "This measure significantly alters fireworks control policy by establishing a new adjudication system for civil infractions, intended to streamline enforcement for lower-level offenses that have been historically difficult to prosecute criminally (HB1483_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_). It also strengthens criminal penalties and clarifies definitions to address what the Attorney General's testimony describes as \"roadblocks to effective prosecution\" under current law (HB1483_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_). Opposition testimony argues this approach constitutes government overreach and infringes on personal liberties and cultural traditions (HB1483_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_).",
  "revenue_sources": "The provided documents do not identify any specific revenue sources to support the implementation of this measure.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The provided documents do not contain sufficient data to project a six-year fiscal outlook. While the bill appropriates funds to the Judiciary for implementation (HB1483_HD1_HSCR983_), no specific cost estimates, staffing projections, or recurring expenses are detailed. The creation of a new adjudication system implies ongoing operational costs for the Judiciary, but these costs are not quantified in the testimony or committee reports. Without workload data or cost estimates for court personnel, technology, or administrative support, a multi-year fiscal projection cannot be accurately determined.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The provided documents do not detail any specific impacts on operating revenues. However, the establishment of a new system of non-criminal fireworks infractions may generate revenue for the state through the collection of fines, though no estimates are provided.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The provided documents do not mention any capital expenditures required for the implementation of this measure.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The provided documents do not contain information regarding the fiscal implications of this measure beyond the initial implementation period. The ongoing costs to the Judiciary for maintaining the adjudication system for fireworks infractions are not specified.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "New testimony before the House Committee on Finance provides more detailed concerns from the legal fireworks industry, with Hawaii Explosives & Pyrotechnics, Inc. warning that HB1483 HD1 could halt permitted professional displays like the Waikiki Friday Night Fireworks (HB1483_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_). The Department of the Attorney General submitted new, specific textual amendments to further clarify definitions and exemptions for permit holders, indicating the bill still requires refinement (HB1483_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_). The scope of testimony has broadened, with new support from the Honolulu Police Department and the Hawaiian Humane Society, and opposition from the Libertarian Party of Hawaii (HB1483_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_). The Committee on Finance's report also noted concerns from the Office of the Public Defender regarding a concurrent trial provision, an issue not mentioned in the previous note's summary (HB1483_HD1_HSCR983_)."
