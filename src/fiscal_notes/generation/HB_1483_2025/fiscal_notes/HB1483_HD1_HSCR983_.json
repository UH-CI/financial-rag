  "overview": "The purpose of this measure is to establish an adjudication system and procedures to process fireworks infractions. [6] It will also amend and establish various definitions and penalties for fireworks offenses, including establishing heightened penalties under certain circumstances, and establish various criminal offenses and penalties related to fireworks or articles pyrotechnics. [6] The purpose of this bill is to facilitate more effective enforcement of Hawaii’s fireworks control laws. [5]",
  "appropriations": "The measure will appropriate funds to the Judiciary to implement this measure. [6] The appropriation of funds will be crucial for implementing these new procedures and supporting the enforcement infrastructure necessary to make this system effective. [5] Funds are appropriated for the establishment of an adjudication system and procedures to process fireworks infractions. [5]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The measure assumes that current laws have made it difficult for state and county agencies to enforce or prosecute fireworks cases. [5] Prosecutors have repeatedly cited challenges posed by \"gathering evidence and meeting the high burden of proof necessary for convictions\", as well as \"stringent definitions [in statute, that] . [5] . . routinely create roadblocks to effective prosecution.\" [5] This bill would largely address the concerns raised by prosecutors, and provide greater clarity and efficiency for law enforcement, prosecutors, and the courts that handle these cases. [5]",
  "agency_impact": "The Judiciary will receive appropriated funds to implement the measure. [6] The Department of Law Enforcement (DLE) states the establishment of various criminal offenses and penalties will provide law enforcement with additional tools to combat illegal fireworks activities. [5] The Department of the Attorney General recommends amendments to clarify and correct various aspects of the fireworks control laws, including for permit holders and the definition of \"inspector\". [5] [5]",
  "economic_impact": "Better enforcement of the fireworks control laws is essential not only to safeguard property from preventable fire damage but also to protect the community from injuries related to fires and explosions, respiratory issues caused by air pollution, and ongoing trauma experienced by individuals due to loud explosions. [5] The proposed heightened penalties for fireworks offenses are critical deterrents that appropriately reflect the serious nature of these violations. [5] These enhanced penalties will serve as a stronger deterrent and help protect our communities from the dangerous consequences of illegal fireworks use. [5]",
  "policy_impact": "This measure establishes an adjudication system and procedures to process fireworks infractions. [6] It amends and establishes various definitions and penalties for fireworks offenses and establishes various criminal offenses and penalties related to fireworks or articles pyrotechnics. [6] For many years, Hawaii’s state laws regarding illicit fireworks have made it difficult for state and county agencies to enforce or prosecute these types of cases, and this bill would largely address the concerns raised by prosecutors. [5] [5]",
  "revenue_sources": "This measure appropriates funds to the Judiciary to implement this measure. [6] The appropriation of funds will be crucial for implementing the new procedures. [5] The bill establishes heightened penalties and new offenses, which will generate revenue through fines. [5]",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The appropriation of funds will be crucial for implementing the new procedures and supporting the enforcement infrastructure necessary to make this system effective. [5] Funds will be appropriated to the Judiciary to implement the measure, including the establishment of an adjudication system. [6] Unlike the previous fiscal note which stated there would be no fiscal implications due to a deferred effective date, the current testimonies treat implementation as imminent. [5] [6] The Department of Law Enforcement strongly supports the bill and notes the appropriation is crucial. [5] [5] The establishment of a new adjudication system will have initial and ongoing costs for the Judiciary. [6] Law enforcement agencies will require resources to utilize the additional tools provided to combat illegal fireworks activities. [5] The Illegal Fireworks Task Force's efforts will be complemented by a more robust framework for enforcement and accountability. [5] The creation of a separate fireworks infraction system is described by one testimony as a potentially \"costly specialty court\". [5] The system is intended to make it easier and faster to adjudicate cases in a district or family court. [5] Ongoing costs will be associated with processing fireworks infractions and enforcing new criminal offenses and penalties. [5] [5]",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "This measure will generate revenue through new penalties for fireworks offenses. [6] The bill establishes non-criminal fireworks infractions for the lowest-level offenses, which will likely result in fines. [5] This will make it easier for officers to increase enforcement of end-use violators, potentially increasing the number of fines collected. [5]",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The appropriation of funds will be crucial for supporting the enforcement infrastructure necessary to make this system effective. [5] Funds will be appropriated to the Judiciary to implement the measure, which may include updates to information systems to handle the new adjudication process. [6] These funds support the establishment of an adjudication system and procedures to process fireworks infractions. [5]",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The establishment of an adjudication system and procedures to process fireworks infractions will represent an ongoing operational cost for the Judiciary. [5] Continued enforcement of the amended definitions, heightened penalties, and various criminal offenses will be a recurring expense for state and county law enforcement agencies. [5] [5] The system is intended to provide a long-term, more robust framework for enforcement and accountability regarding illegal fireworks. [5]",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The primary update is that the current set of documents from February 2025 treats the bill's implementation and associated fiscal impacts as immediate, directly contradicting the previous fiscal note's core assumption. [5] [6] The previous note's conclusion of no fiscal impact for six years was based on an amended effective date of July 1, 3000, a detail that is not mentioned in the current documents and appears to be superseded. [5] Consequently, the statements in the previous note regarding no appropriations, revenues, or expenditures within the six-year period are no longer relevant. [5] The current analysis reflects testimony on the crucial need for appropriations to the Judiciary and for enforcement infrastructure. [5] [6] Furthermore, this fiscal note is based on extensive new testimony from multiple government agencies, industry groups, and the public, providing detailed perspectives and suggested amendments not reflected in the previous note.
