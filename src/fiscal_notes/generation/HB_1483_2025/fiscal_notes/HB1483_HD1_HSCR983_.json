  "overview": "The purpose of this bill is to facilitate more effective enforcement of Hawaii’s fireworks control laws. [5] This measure will establish an adjudication system and procedures to process fireworks infractions, amend and establish various definitions and penalties for fireworks offenses, and appropriate funds to the Judiciary to implement this measure. [6] [6] The bill aims to strengthen and clarify existing criminal offenses, establish new offenses, establish heightened penalties for repeat offenders, and establish non-criminal fireworks infractions for the lowest-level offenses. [5] [5]",
  "appropriations": "The appropriation of funds will be crucial for implementing these new procedures and supporting the enforcement infrastructure necessary to make this system effective. [5] The measure appropriates funds to the Judiciary to implement this measure. [6]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "For many years, Hawaii’s state laws regarding illicit fireworks have made it difficult for state and county agencies to enforce or prosecute these types of cases. [5] Prosecutors have repeatedly cited challenges posed by \"gathering evidence and meeting the high burden of proof necessary for convictions\", as well as \"stringent definitions [in statute, that] . . . routinely create roadblocks to effective prosecution.\" [5] This bill would largely address the concerns raised by prosecutors, and provide greater clarity and efficiency for law enforcement, prosecutors, and the courts that handle these cases. [5]",
  "agency_impact": "The establishment of various criminal offenses and penalties related to fireworks and articles pyrotechnics will provide law enforcement with additional tools to combat illegal fireworks activities. [5] The Honolulu Police Department (HPD) supports this bill, which seeks to clarify the definitions of fireworks and improve enforcement. [5] The Department of the Attorney General recommends amending the definition of \"inspector\" and is unclear which law enforcement officers may be designated as administrative inspectors. [5] [5]",
  "economic_impact": "Better enforcement of the fireworks control laws is essential not only to safeguard property from preventable fire damage but also to protect the community from injuries related to fires and explosions, respiratory issues caused by air pollution, and ongoing trauma experienced by individuals due to loud explosions. [5] [5] These bombs increasingly go off without regard to date and terrorize pets and people alike. [5] The unpredictable barrage makes it impossible to prepare and creates sustained stress, which can do lasting damage to emotional, mental and physical health. [5] [5]",
  "policy_impact": "This bill complements the efforts of the Illegal Fireworks Task Force, established under Act 67, Session Laws of Hawai'i, 2023, by providing a more robust framework for enforcement and accountability. [5] [5] The measure establishes heightened penalties for fireworks offenses, particularly in cases resulting in substantial bodily injury, serious bodily injury, or death. [5] The Department of the Attorney General recommends amendments to ensure that anyone who holds a permit or license for fireworks can continue using them as intended. [5] [5]",
  "revenue_sources": "The bill establishes an adjudication system and procedures to process fireworks infractions and amends penalties for fireworks offenses. [5] The measure appropriates funds to the Judiciary to implement the measure.

[6] [6] The bill will establish various criminal offenses and penalties related to fireworks or articles pyrotechnics. [6] Funds are appropriated to the Judiciary to implement this measure. [6] The appropriation of funds will be crucial for implementing these new procedures and supporting the enforcement infrastructure necessary to make this system effective. [5] This bill complements the efforts of the Illegal Fireworks Task Force, which has already successfully removed hundreds of thousands of pounds of illegal fireworks from Hawaii's streets. [5] [5] The proposed heightened penalties are critical deterrents that appropriately reflect the serious nature of these violations. [5] The Department of Law Enforcement stated these enhanced penalties will serve as a stronger deterrent and help protect communities. [5] A complex adjudication system risks burdening the judicial system with minor infractions, diverting resources from more serious public safety concerns. [5] [5] The creation of a separate fireworks infraction system, a costly specialty court, may not effectively deter illegal fireworks use. [5]",

[5] No specific capital expenditures are detailed in the provided documents.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The establishment of an adjudication system and procedures to process fireworks infractions represents a significant step forward in addressing the ongoing challenges of illegal fireworks in Hawaii. [5] The appropriation of funds will be crucial for supporting the enforcement infrastructure necessary to make this system effective on an ongoing basis. [5] The creation of a separate fireworks infraction system may function as a costly specialty court. [5]",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The new fiscal note is based on testimony that provides significantly more context than the documents in the previous note. [6] Unlike the previous note, this one does not mention a future effective date of July 1, 3000, suggesting the fiscal impacts are now considered immediate. [6] The previous note cited specific dollar amounts for fines and fees, whereas the current documents do not contain these figures, focusing instead on the appropriation of unspecified funds to the Judiciary. [6] New information includes detailed testimony from the Department of the Attorney General with specific suggested amendments to the bill's language concerning permit holders and definitions. [5] Testimony from the Department of Law Enforcement highlights the ongoing success of the Illegal Fireworks Task Force and frames this bill as a complementary effort. [5] [5] Additionally, there is now testimony from opponents like the Libertarian Party of Hawaii and industry stakeholders like TNT Fireworks and Phantom Fireworks, who raise concerns about infringing on freedoms, burdening law enforcement, and imposing unnecessary restrictions on legal consumer fireworks.
