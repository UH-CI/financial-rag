  "overview": "The purpose of this measure is to establish an adjudication system and procedures to process fireworks infractions and to amend and establish various definitions and penalties for fireworks offenses. [6] [6] The bill seeks to facilitate more effective enforcement of Hawaiiâ€™s fireworks control laws by amending definitions, strengthening and clarifying existing criminal offenses, establishing new offenses, and establishing non-criminal fireworks infractions for the lowest-level offenses. [5] [5] This bill would largely address the concerns raised by prosecutors, and provide greater clarity and efficiency for law enforcement, prosecutors, and the courts that handle these cases. [5]",
  "appropriations": "This measure appropriates funds to the Judiciary to implement this measure. [6] According to the Department of Law Enforcement, the appropriation of funds will be crucial for implementing these new procedures and supporting the enforcement infrastructure necessary to make this system effective. [5] The provided documents do not specify any dollar amounts for this appropriation. [5]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal impact is based on the appropriation of funds required for the Judiciary to implement the measure. [6] Testimony introduced concerns that a complex adjudication system risks burdening the judicial system with minor infractions, diverting resources from more serious public safety concerns. [5] [5] It was also noted that the creation of a separate fireworks infraction system could be a costly specialty court, which may not effectively deter illegal fireworks use. [5]",
  "agency_impact": "The Department of the Attorney General recommends amending the definition of \"inspector\" by deleting the phrase, \"any law enforcement officer or . [5] . [5]\" The Department is unclear which law enforcement officers may be designated as administrative inspectors for purposes of section 132D-22, HRS, as amended. [5] The Department also recommends amendments to clarify wording for permit and license holders to ensure they may continue to use their permits and licenses as intended. [5] [5]",
  "economic_impact": "Testimony from fireworks distributors expressed concern that the measure imposes additional restrictions on consumer fireworks and could have unintended negative consequences for businesses. [5] [5] A complex adjudication system also risks burdening the judicial system with minor infractions, diverting resources from more serious public safety concerns. [5] [5] The Honolulu Police Department believes better enforcement of fireworks control laws is essential to safeguard property from preventable fire damage and protect the community from injuries. [5]",
  "policy_impact": "The Office of the Public Defender has asserted that it is the lack of enforcement, rather than the lack or severity of penalties, that has resulted in the low number of charges brought under existing fireworks control laws. [6] [6] The Department of the Attorney General has suggested several amendments to further clarify and correct various aspects of the fireworks control laws, including conforming amendments for the terms \"distribute\" and \"distribution\". [5] [5] TNT Fireworks requested a safe harbor provision to allow licensed retailers and wholesalers to transport and store consumer fireworks, even in counties where use is restricted. [5]",
  "revenue_sources": "The measure appropriates funds to the Judiciary, but the new documents do not specify the source or amount of funding. [6] The previous fiscal note identified revenue from fines and fees, but the current testimonies and committee report do not contain specific dollar amounts. [6]",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The appropriation of funds will be crucial for implementing the new procedures established in the bill. [5] The creation of a separate fireworks infraction system is described in testimony as a potentially costly specialty court. [5] This system may burden the judicial system with minor infractions and divert resources from more serious public safety concerns. [5] [5] The Department of Law Enforcement (DLE) stated its strong support for the bill and noted the establishment of an adjudication system represents a significant step forward. [5] [5] The proposed heightened penalties for fireworks offenses are described as critical deterrents. [5] The bill provides law enforcement with additional tools to combat illegal fireworks activities. [5] The Illegal Fireworks Task Force has already successfully removed hundreds of thousands of pounds of illegal fireworks from Hawaii's streets. [5] This measure complements the efforts of the Illegal Fireworks Task Force by providing a more robust framework for enforcement and accountability. [5] [5] The provided documents do not contain specific financial projections for a six-year period. [6]",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The new documents do not provide any new information or specific figures regarding the potential impact on operating revenue. [6]",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "This measure appropriates funds to the Judiciary to implement this measure. [6] The new documents do not specify whether these funds are for capital expenditures or provide any cost estimates. [6]",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The provided documents do not contain information on fiscal implications beyond the initial implementation phase of the measure. [6] Long-term implications would depend on the volume of infractions and the operational costs of the adjudication system. [5]",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "New information is primarily from testimony provided to the House Committee on Finance. [6] The Department of the Attorney General offered specific amendments to clarify the status of permit and license holders and questioned the scope of law enforcement's role as administrative inspectors. [5] [5] [5] The Office of the Public Defender asserted that the underlying issue is a lack of enforcement, not insufficient penalties. [6] [6] Industry stakeholders voiced concerns about the bill's impact on legal consumer fireworks, with some requesting a 'safe harbor provision' for transport and storage. [5] [5]"
