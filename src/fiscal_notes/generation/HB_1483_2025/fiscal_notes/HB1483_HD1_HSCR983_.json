  "overview": "This measure establishes an adjudication system and procedures to process non-criminal fireworks infractions, amends definitions, and strengthens criminal penalties for fireworks offenses. The bill's purpose is to facilitate more effective enforcement and prosecution of Hawaii's fireworks control laws, which have historically been challenging. It appropriates funds to the Judiciary to implement these new systems and procedures.",
  "appropriations": "The bill appropriates an unspecified amount of funds to the Judiciary to implement the measure, specifically for establishing the adjudication system and procedures to process fireworks infractions. Testimony from the Department of Law Enforcement highlights that this appropriation is crucial for supporting the enforcement infrastructure needed to make the system effective. No specific fiscal year or breakdown of costs is provided.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal analysis assumes that the creation of a non-criminal infraction system will lead to more effective enforcement and collection of penalties than the current criminal justice process for minor offenses. This assumption is based on testimony citing a 2019 Legislative Reference Bureau report that identified difficulties in meeting the high burden of proof for criminal convictions. The methodology involves creating a new judicial workload, for which an appropriation is deemed necessary, though cost estimates are not detailed.",
  "agency_impact": "The Department of the Attorney General, Department of Law Enforcement (DLE), and Honolulu Police Department all strongly support the measure, anticipating it will provide a more robust framework for enforcement and accountability. The DLE states the bill provides law enforcement with additional tools that complement the efforts of the Illegal Fireworks Task Force. The changes are expected to provide greater clarity for law enforcement, prosecutors, and the courts handling these cases.",
  "economic_impact": "Testimony from fireworks distributors argues the bill imposes unnecessary restrictions on legal consumer fireworks, which could negatively impact their businesses and penalize law-abiding citizens. Concerns were raised that the creation of a separate fireworks infraction system would be a costly specialty court, burdening the judicial system. A professional fireworks display company also expressed concern that the bill's new prohibitions could eliminate many legally permitted commercial displays, such as hotel and community events.",
  "policy_impact": "This measure represents a significant policy shift by creating a new civil adjudication track for fireworks violations, similar to traffic infractions, to run parallel with the existing criminal framework. By establishing new offenses and clarifying definitions, the bill aims to address long-standing prosecutorial challenges cited by state and county agencies. This dual-system approach is intended to lower the burden of proof for minor offenses, thereby increasing the volume and success of enforcement actions.",
  "revenue_sources": "The bill appropriates funds to the Judiciary, but the source of these funds, presumably the general fund, is not specified in the provided documents. The measure is expected to create a new revenue stream from the collection of fines for the newly established non-criminal fireworks infractions. No estimate of this potential revenue is provided.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The measure appropriates funds in the first year to the Judiciary to establish the new fireworks infraction adjudication system. This will create new, recurring annual operating costs for the Judiciary to manage the caseload, including personnel and administrative expenses. While specific multi-year projections are not provided, the system is intended to be permanent, implying ongoing costs beyond the initial setup. Law enforcement agencies will also incur recurring costs for training and enforcement activities related to the new infractions, although the bill's intent is to make these activities more efficient. The long-term fiscal commitment will depend on the volume of citations and the operational scale required by the Judiciary to process them. The success of the program is dependent on sufficient and sustained funding for both the Judiciary and enforcement agencies.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The bill is expected to have a positive impact on operating revenues by establishing a new system of fines for non-criminal fireworks infractions. This will create a new revenue stream for the state or counties that did not previously exist. The total amount of revenue generated is indeterminate and will depend on the frequency of citations and the collection rate of fines.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The provided documents do not identify any specific capital expenditures required for the implementation of this measure. The appropriation to the Judiciary is intended for operational and administrative setup costs rather than for new facilities or major equipment. It is assumed the new adjudication process will be handled within existing court facilities.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "After the initial six-year period, the primary fiscal implication will be the sustained annual operating costs for the Judiciary to administer the fireworks infraction adjudication system. These permanent costs will include salaries for court staff and ongoing administrative support for processing violations. The long-term viability of this new enforcement mechanism will depend on continued funding for both judicial and law enforcement functions.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "This fiscal note is based on the bill as presented to the Finance Committee, with a central new feature being an appropriation of funds to the Judiciary to create a dedicated adjudication system for fireworks infractions. The previous note focused on the amendments that led to this version of the bill, such as restoring inspection authority. This note incorporates a broader base of testimony, including support from the Honolulu Police Department and specific economic concerns from multiple fireworks distributors regarding the impact on legal sales and the potential costs of a new 'specialty court'."
