  "overview": "The purpose of this measure is to establish an adjudication system and procedures to process fireworks infractions. [6] The bill is intended to facilitate more effective enforcement of Hawaii’s fireworks control laws by amending definitions, strengthening criminal offenses, establishing new offenses, and creating heightened penalties for repeat offenders or when offenses result in injury or death. [5] [5] This measure also establishes various criminal offenses and penalties related to fireworks or articles pyrotechnics and appropriates funds to the Judiciary to implement the bill. [6]",
  "appropriations": "The appropriation of funds will be crucial for implementing these new procedures and supporting the enforcement infrastructure necessary to make this system effective. [5] The measure appropriates funds to the Judiciary to implement this measure. [6] As noted in testimony, the bill establishes various criminal offenses and penalties and appropriates funds. [5]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "For many years, Hawaii’s state laws regarding illicit fireworks have made it difficult for state and county agencies to enforce or prosecute these types of cases. [5] Prosecutors have repeatedly cited challenges posed by \"gathering evidence and meeting the high burden of proof necessary for convictions\", as well as \"stringent definitions [in statute, that] . . . routinely create roadblocks to effective prosecution.\" [5] This bill would largely address the concerns raised by prosecutors, and provide greater clarity and efficiency for law enforcement, prosecutors, and the courts that handle these cases. [5]",
  "agency_impact": "This bill is expected to provide greater clarity and efficiency for law enforcement, prosecutors, and the courts that handle fireworks cases. [5] The establishment of various criminal offenses and penalties related to fireworks and articles pyrotechnics will provide law enforcement with additional tools to combat illegal fireworks activities. [5] The Department of the Attorney General recommends amending the definition of \"inspector\" and noted it is unclear which law enforcement officers may be designated as administrative inspectors. [5] [5]",
  "economic_impact": "Better enforcement of the fireworks control laws is essential not only to safeguard property from preventable fire damage but also to protect the community from injuries related to fires and explosions. [5] Enforcement can also protect from respiratory issues caused by air pollution, and ongoing trauma experienced by individuals due to loud explosions. [5] [5] Despite tragic deaths and injuries spanning many years, the crime of using illegal fireworks is rarely punished. [5]",
  "policy_impact": "The purpose of this bill is to facilitate more effective enforcement of Hawaii’s fireworks control laws by amending definitions to reflect more common-sense standards and strengthening existing criminal offenses. [5] The bill establishes new offenses, heightened penalties, and non-criminal fireworks infractions for the lowest-level offenses. [5] This comprehensive measure aims to increase enforcement against fireworks infractions by creating a new system of adjudication and new penalties to address the current failures of our legal system. [5] [5]",
  "revenue_sources": "The measure appropriates funds to the Judiciary to implement this measure. [6] The Department of Law Enforcement testified that the appropriation of funds will be crucial for implementing the new procedures and supporting the necessary enforcement infrastructure. [5] The specific source of these appropriated funds is not identified in the provided documents. [6]",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "This measure appropriates funds to the Judiciary to establish and implement an adjudication system and procedures to process fireworks infractions. [6] [6] The appropriation of funds will be crucial for implementing these new procedures and supporting the enforcement infrastructure necessary to make this system effective. [5] This indicates ongoing operational costs for the Judiciary and law enforcement agencies over the six-year planning period. [5] [6] The bill complements the efforts of the Illegal Fireworks Task Force, established under Act 67, Session Laws of Hawai'i, 2023. [5] The Task Force has already successfully removed hundreds of thousands of pounds of illegal fireworks from Hawaii's streets. [5] The creation of a separate fireworks infraction system may be a costly specialty court, which would divert resources from more serious public safety concerns. [5] The Honolulu Police Department supports the bill, which seeks to clarify the definitions of fireworks and improve enforcement. [5] Better enforcement is essential to safeguard property from preventable fire damage and protect the community from injuries. [5] The bill is expected to provide greater clarity and efficiency for law enforcement, prosecutors, and the courts that handle these cases, which implies recurring administrative and personnel costs. [5]",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The bill establishes non-criminal fireworks infractions for the lowest-level offenses. [5] It also establishes an adjudication system and procedures to process these fireworks infractions. [6] Fines associated with these new infractions are anticipated to generate operating revenue for the State, although no specific revenue projections are provided in the documents. [5] [5]",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "This measure appropriates funds to the Judiciary to implement the bill. [6] Establishing a new adjudication system and procedures to process fireworks infractions may require capital expenditures. [6] These could include investments in information technology systems or other infrastructure, though no specific capital projects or amounts are detailed in the provided documents. [6]",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The fiscal obligations associated with this measure are expected to continue beyond the six-year planning period. [5] Ongoing annual funding will be required to sustain the Judiciary's adjudication system and to support continued enforcement activities by state and county agencies. [6] [5] The long-term costs will consist primarily of recurring operational and personnel expenses for the courts and law enforcement. [5] [5]",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The most significant change from the previous fiscal note is that the current bill's fiscal implications are immediate, as the provided documents do not mention the prior effective date of July 1, 3000, which had deferred all costs. [6] Consequently, the measure now appropriates funds to the Judiciary for current implementation of a new adjudication system. [6] Policy discussions have shifted from the previous focus on weight thresholds and the act of throwing fireworks to new amendments suggested by the Department of the Attorney General. [6] These new amendments aim to clarify provisions for permit and license holders and address which law enforcement officers may be designated as administrative inspectors. [6]"
