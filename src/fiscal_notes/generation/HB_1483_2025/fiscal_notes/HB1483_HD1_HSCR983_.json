  "overview": "This measure establishes a new adjudication system and procedures specifically for processing non-criminal fireworks infractions, a significant structural change to enforcement. It also creates new criminal offenses and enhances penalties for violations that result in bodily injury or death, aiming to provide a more effective deterrent than existing laws. The purpose is to address long-standing difficulties in prosecution by clarifying definitions and creating a tiered penalty structure.",
  "appropriations": "The measure appropriates an unspecified amount of funds to the Judiciary. These funds are designated for the implementation of the new adjudication system for fireworks infractions. The Department of Law Enforcement also testified that the appropriation is crucial for supporting the enforcement infrastructure necessary to make the new system effective.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "",
  "agency_impact": "This measure newly impacts the Judiciary, which will be responsible for establishing and managing the new adjudication system for fireworks infractions, requiring dedicated resources. Additionally, the Office of the Public Defender has raised concerns regarding a concurrent trial provision in the measure. The Public Defender's office also asserts that the low number of charges under current law stems from a lack of enforcement rather than a lack of severe penalties.",
  "economic_impact": "Testimony from the legal fireworks industry details more specific negative economic impacts not previously identified. Licensed distributors for major retailers such as Costco, Longs Drugs, and Foodland argue that additional restrictions on legal consumer fireworks will harm their businesses. Furthermore, a professional pyrotechnics company stated the bill, as written, could prohibit major permitted commercial displays, such as the weekly Waikiki fireworks show, potentially impacting the tourism and events industry.",
  "policy_impact": "A major policy shift in this measure is the creation of a two-tiered enforcement framework, distinguishing between non-criminal infractions and more serious criminal offenses. Testimony has revealed new policy concerns, including the removal of the county fire departments' authority to issue licenses under ยง132D-7 without specifying a clear statewide replacement process. Concerns were also raised that new provisions regulating the transportation of pyrotechnics may be redundant or in conflict with existing federal Department of Transportation regulations.",
  "revenue_sources": "",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The appropriation of funds to the Judiciary to establish and operate a new adjudication system for fireworks infractions will introduce new, ongoing operational costs for the state. This system, which one stakeholder referred to as a \"costly specialty court,\" will necessitate recurring expenditures for judicial and administrative staffing and case processing. The Department of Law Enforcement also indicated that appropriations are essential for building out the enforcement infrastructure, implying sustained personnel and operational costs for law enforcement agencies to effectively utilize the new infraction and criminal offense framework. The creation of a permanent adjudication process suggests these fiscal commitments will extend throughout the six-year period, with the total cost depending on the volume of infractions and the scale of enforcement activities. These new costs for the Judiciary and law enforcement were not previously detailed.",

  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The fiscal obligations created by this measure are expected to be permanent, centered on the perpetual operational costs for the Judiciary's fireworks infraction adjudication system. Continued funding will also be necessary for the Department of Law Enforcement to maintain the enhanced enforcement infrastructure. The sustainability of these ongoing costs will be dependent on future legislative appropriations to both the Judiciary and law enforcement agencies.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "This fiscal note identifies substantial new information. A key change is the explicit appropriation of funds to the Judiciary to establish a new, permanent adjudication system for fireworks infractions. New agency impacts on the Judiciary and concerns from the Office of the Public Defender are now included. More detailed economic impacts on the legal consumer and professional fireworks industries have been identified from testimony, including potential disruptions to major retailers and iconic public events. Finally, new policy concerns have been raised regarding the shift in licensing authority from counties to an unspecified state process and potential conflicts with federal regulations."
