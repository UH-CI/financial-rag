  "overview": "The purpose of this measure is to: (1) Establish an adjudication system and procedures to process fireworks infractions; (2) Amend and establish various definitions and penalties for fireworks offenses, including establishing heightened penalties under certain circumstances; (3) Establish various criminal offenses and penalties related to fireworks or articles pyrotechnics; and (4) Appropriate funds to the Judiciary to implement this measure (HB1483_HD1_HSCR983_). The bill aims to facilitate more effective enforcement of Hawaii’s fireworks control laws by amending definitions, strengthening offenses, and establishing non-criminal fireworks infractions for the lowest-level offenses (HB1483_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_). The Department of the Attorney General states this bill would largely address the concerns raised by prosecutors, and provide greater clarity and efficiency for law enforcement, prosecutors, and the courts that handle these cases (HB1483_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_).",
  "appropriations": "The purpose of this measure is to appropriate funds to the Judiciary to implement this measure (HB1483_HD1_HSCR983_). The Department of Law Enforcement states that the appropriation of funds will be crucial for implementing these new procedures and supporting the enforcement infrastructure necessary to make this system effective (HB1483_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_). The specific amount of the appropriation is not detailed in the provided documents.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The measure is based on the assumption that for many years, Hawaii’s state laws regarding illicit fireworks have made it difficult for state and county agencies to enforce or prosecute these types of cases (HB1483_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_). Prosecutors have repeatedly cited challenges posed by \"gathering evidence and meeting the high burden of proof necessary for convictions\" and \"stringent definitions [in statute, that] . . . routinely create roadblocks to effective prosecution\" (HB1483_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_). These challenges have resulted in a largely \"ineffective deterrent\" to the distribution and use of illicit fireworks, which this bill aims to address (HB1483_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_).",
  "agency_impact": "The Committee on Finance notes the suggested amendments from the Department of the Attorney General in its written testimony to clarify that those holding fireworks permits or licenses may continue to use their permits or licenses (HB1483_HD1_HSCR983_). The Department of the Attorney General also recommends amending the definition of \"inspector\" on page 72, line 8, by deleting the phrase, \"any law enforcement officer or . . . \", stating it is unclear which law enforcement officers may be designated as administrative inspectors and requests additional time to discuss this further with other agencies (HB1483_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_). The Honolulu Police Department supports this bill, which seeks to clarify the definitions of fireworks and improve enforcement (HB1483_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_).",
  "economic_impact": "Testimony from Phantom Fireworks suggests this bill introduces a complex adjudication system that risks burdening the judicial system with minor infractions, diverting resources from more serious public safety concerns (HB1483_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_). The creation of a separate fireworks infraction system is described as a \"costly specialty court\" (HB1483_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_). Additionally, testimony from Hawaii Explosives & Pyrotechnics expresses concern that as written, prohibitions on fireworks use within five hundred feet of any dwelling \"would eliminate the use of articles pyrotechnic at any hotel or resort\" (HB1483_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_).",
  "policy_impact": "This measure establishes non-criminal fireworks infractions for the lowest-level offenses (HB1483_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_). Your Committee further notes the concerns of the Office of the Public Defender regarding the concurrent trial provision in this measure and the office's assertion that it is the lack of enforcement, rather than the lack or severity of penalties, that has resulted in the low number of charges brought under existing fireworks control laws (HB1483_HD1_HSCR983_). Hawaii Explosives & Pyrotechnics, Inc. is concerned that proposed revisions to HRS§132D, such as prohibiting fireworks near a \"public beach\", would prohibit most commercial public displays, including the Waikiki Friday Night Fireworks display held every week (HB1483_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_).",

  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "This fiscal note provides new details not included in the prior version. The overview and appropriations sections now specify the bill's purpose and its appropriation of unspecified funds to the Judiciary. The assumptions section details the rationale that existing laws are an \"ineffective deterrent.\" Agency impact now includes specific amendment recommendations from the Department of the Attorney General regarding permit holders and the definition of \"inspector.\" The economic impact section introduces testimony regarding the potential for a \"costly specialty court\" and negative impacts on commercial pyrotechnic displays. Finally, the policy impact section adds concerns from the Office of the Public Defender about the \"concurrent trial provision\" and from industry stakeholders about the potential prohibition of events like the Waikiki Friday Night Fireworks display."
