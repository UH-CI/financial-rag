The legislature finds that improved enforcement of the fireworks control laws is necessary to protect the community from fire- and explosion-related injuries, respiratory distress caused by the air pollution, and recurring trauma to afflicted persons due to loud explosions (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt).

Enhanced penalties under certain circumstances could increase fines up to $25,000 (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt) or $50,000 (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt) (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt).\",\n\"agency_impact\": \"This bill addresses concerns raised by prosecutors and provides clarity and efficiency for law enforcement, prosecutors, and courts that handle these cases (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt).

Similar to the way non-criminal traffic citations are issued now, a law enforcement officer could issue multiple fireworks citations without having to spend additional time interviewing witnesses, collecting evidence, or writing police reports (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt).\",\n\"economic_impact\": \"The measure establishes a range of fines for violations.

The bill incorporates fireworks infractions into the existing adjudication process for traffic and emergency period infractions under Chapter 291D, Hawaii Revised Statutes (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt).
