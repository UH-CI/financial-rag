  "appropriations": "Your Committee on Conference has amended this measure by deleting the appropriation. [13] The purpose of the measure previously included appropriating funds. [13]",

[12] This includes implementing graduated penalties for repeat or felony-level offenses and imposing enhanced penalties for offenses that result in injury or death. [12] The measure also adjudicates fireworks infractions under the same system used for traffic and emergency period infractions, which will allow law enforcement agencies and the judiciary to quickly and efficiently process low-level cases. [12]",
  "agency_impact": "The fireworks infractions system will allow law enforcement agencies and the judiciary to quickly and efficiently process low-level cases, while also allowing them to prioritize higher-level cases as appropriate. [12] The system of processing traffic infractions established by chapter 291D is well-suited to certain types of violations of the fireworks control law.

[12]",
