  "overview": "This measure aims to improve the enforcement of fireworks control laws by amending definitions, creating new offenses, and establishing a tiered system of penalties. It introduces heightened criminal penalties for serious violations, particularly those resulting in bodily injury or death, and establishes a new non-criminal infraction system for lower-level offenses. These infractions will be adjudicated through the existing civil process used for traffic violations, creating a more efficient mechanism for enforcement.",
  "appropriations": "The Hawaii County Police Department noted its support for the bill's initial inclusion of a monetary appropriation to carry out its purposes. However, the final version of the bill, as amended by the Conference Committee, explicitly deletes the appropriation. Therefore, no funds are appropriated under this measure, and implementing agencies will be required to absorb any associated costs.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal analysis is based on the establishment of new fines and fees rather than specific workload projections. Key assumptions include the generation of revenue from new non-criminal infractions, with fines ranging from $200 to $5,000, and a new $20 administrative fee per adjudicated infraction. The total fiscal impact is contingent on the volume of citations issued by law enforcement and processed by the Judiciary under the new framework.",
  "agency_impact": "The measure is expected to streamline enforcement for law enforcement agencies by establishing a quick and efficient citation process for infractions, similar to traffic tickets. The Judiciary will experience an increased caseload within its existing infraction adjudication system, which will be supported by revenue from a new $20 administrative fee per infraction. The Department of the Attorney General anticipates more effective prosecution of serious fireworks offenses due to clarified definitions and strengthened penalties.",
  "economic_impact": "The measure is anticipated to generate long-term cost savings for the state and counties by reducing fireworks-related incidents, such as fires and serious injuries, thereby lessening the strain on emergency responders and healthcare services. It also establishes new revenue streams from fines, with 80 percent allocated to counties for law enforcement and 20 percent to the State. The simplified adjudication process for infractions is expected to create administrative efficiencies.",
  "policy_impact": "This measure enacts a significant policy shift by decriminalizing low-level fireworks violations, reclassifying them as non-criminal civil infractions adjudicated under the same framework as traffic offenses. It amends Chapter 132D, Hawaii Revised Statutes, to create a more robust and tiered penalty structure, with severe criminal penalties reserved for the most serious offenses, particularly those causing bodily harm. This establishes a clearer, more enforceable legal framework intended to deter the importation and use of illegal fireworks.",
  "revenue_sources": "Revenue to support the measure's enforcement will be generated primarily from new fines and fees for fireworks infractions. All fines collected will be distributed with 80 percent allocated to the county where the violation occurred for law enforcement purposes and 20 percent to the State's general fund. Additionally, a new $20 administrative fee will be imposed on each adjudicated infraction, with the resulting revenue directed to the Judiciary Computer System Special Fund.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The six-year fiscal outlook for this measure is contingent on future enforcement levels and public compliance. All initial implementation costs must be absorbed by the Judiciary and county law enforcement agencies, as no appropriation is provided. A recurring revenue stream will be generated from fines and a new $20 administrative fee per infraction. It is projected that revenue will increase in the initial years as the new system is established, potentially stabilizing in later years if the measure proves to be an effective deterrent. Eighty percent of fine revenue will be directed to counties for law enforcement, and twenty percent will go to the State. The administrative fees will provide ongoing support for the Judiciary's computer system special fund. No new positions are funded, but counties may use their portion of fine revenue to support enforcement staffing. The overall net fiscal impact is expected to be positive, assuming enforcement efficiencies and fine collections outweigh administrative costs.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "This measure is expected to have a positive impact on operating revenues for the State and counties. The State's general fund will receive 20 percent of all fines collected from fireworks violations, while counties will receive 80 percent to be used for law enforcement purposes. The Judiciary will also gain a new revenue stream from a $20 administrative fee on each infraction, which will be deposited into its computer system special fund.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "This measure is not expected to have any direct impact on capital expenditures. The adjudication of new fireworks infractions will be integrated into the existing judicial infrastructure and processes used for traffic and other civil violations. No new facilities, equipment, or major technology investments are specified or anticipated as a result of this bill.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "After the initial six-year period, the fiscal implications of this measure are expected to be ongoing and stable, as the established infraction system is permanent. Annual operating costs for enforcement and adjudication will continue, and these are anticipated to be largely offset by the recurring revenue from fines and fees. The long-term net fiscal impact will depend on the measure's success as a deterrent, which could potentially lead to a decrease in both the number of violations and the associated revenue.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The most significant update from previous versions of the bill is the deletion of the appropriation in the final Conference Draft (CD1). While earlier considerations included funding to carry out the bill's purposes, the final measure provides no appropriation, requiring the Judiciary and law enforcement agencies to absorb implementation costs. This fiscal note provides the first detailed analysis of the bill's fiscal impacts, including the creation of a new $20 administrative fee for the Judiciary and the specific 80/20 split of fine revenue between counties and the State."
