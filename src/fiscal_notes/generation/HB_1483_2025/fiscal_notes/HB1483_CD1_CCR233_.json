  "overview": "The purpose of this measure is to: (1) Establish various criminal offenses and penalties related to fireworks or articles pyrotechnic; (2) Amend and establish various definitions and penalties for fireworks offenses, including establishing heightened penalties under certain circumstances; and (3) Incorporate fireworks infractions into the existing adjudication process for traffic and emergency period infractions (HB1483_CD1_CCR233_.HTM.txt). The legislature finds that improved enforcement of the fireworks control laws is necessary to protect the community from fire- and explosion-related injuries, respiratory distress caused by the air pollution, and recurring trauma to afflicted persons due to loud explosions (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt). The fireworks infractions system will allow law enforcement agencies and the judiciary to quickly and efficiently process low-level cases, while also allowing them to prioritize higher-level cases as appropriate (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt).",
  "appropriations": "Your Committee on Conference has amended this measure by deleting the appropriation (HB1483_CD1_CCR233_.HTM.txt).",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "This bill establishes penalties for fireworks infractions, with fines for standalone offenses ranging from an infraction carrying only a $200 (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt) fine, to class C felonies facing up to a $10,000 (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt) fine and/or up to five years imprisonment (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt). The bill establishes a $300 (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt) fine for purchasing, possessing, or setting off less than five pounds of illicit aerial devices, display fireworks, or articles pyrotechnic (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt). Enhanced penalties under certain circumstances could increase fines up to $25,000 (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt) or $50,000 (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt) (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt).",
  "agency_impact": "This bill addresses concerns raised by prosecutors and provides clarity and efficiency for law enforcement, prosecutors, and courts that handle these cases (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt). The establishment of non-criminal fireworks infractions is intended to allow law enforcement agencies and courts to hold a much higher number of individuals accountable for their use of illicit fireworks quickly and safely (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt). Similar to the way non-criminal traffic citations are issued now, a law enforcement officer could issue multiple fireworks citations without having to spend additional time interviewing witnesses, collecting evidence, or writing police reports (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt).",
  "economic_impact": "The measure establishes a range of fines for violations. A person who violates consumer fireworks prohibitions shall be subject to a $200 (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt) fine for certain violations and a $1,000 (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt) fine for others (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt). Any carrier or person who violates shipping requirements shall be subject to a $1,000 (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt) fine for a first offense, a $2,000 (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt) fine for a second offense, and a $5,000 (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt) fine for a third or subsequent offense (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt). Generally, any person violating any other provision of this chapter shall be fined no less than $500 (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt) and no more than $5,000 (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt) for each violation (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt).",
  "policy_impact": "This measure amends Chapter 132D, Hawaii Revised Statutes, by strengthening and clarifying existing criminal fireworks offenses, establishing new offenses, and establishing heightened penalties under certain circumstances (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt). The bill incorporates fireworks infractions into the existing adjudication process for traffic and emergency period infractions under Chapter 291D, Hawaii Revised Statutes (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt). The legislature believes that a more robust continuum of enforcement mechanisms must be established to promote compliance with the fireworks control laws (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt).",
  "revenue_sources": "Revenue will be sourced from fines collected for violations of this chapter. The court shall collect the fines and pay twenty per cent to the State and eighty per cent to the county in which the fine was imposed (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt). Additionally, the court shall impose an administrative fee of $20 (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt) for each fireworks infraction, with these fees deposited into the judiciary computer system special fund (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt).",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The fiscal impact over six years is indeterminate, as it depends on the number of violations and the amounts of fines collected. This measure establishes several new revenue-generating penalties. For example, specific consumer fireworks violations are subject to a $200 (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt) fine, while others are subject to a $1,000 (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt) fine (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt). Possessing small amounts of illegal fireworks will result in a $300 (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt) fine (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt). Carriers violating shipping rules face fines of $1,000 (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt), $2,000 (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt), or $5,000 (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt) depending on offense history (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt). Other violations are subject to fines between $500 (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt) and $5,000 (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt) (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt). Testimony indicates that penalties for standalone offenses can reach up to a $10,000 (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt) fine, while enhanced penalties for offenses causing injury or for repeat offenders can lead to fines of up to $25,000 (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt) or $50,000 (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt) (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt). The judiciary will also collect a $20 (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt) administrative fee for each fireworks infraction where judgment favors the State (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt). The total revenue generated for the State and counties will depend on enforcement activity and compliance rates.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "This measure is anticipated to increase operating revenues for the State and counties through the collection of fines. Of the fines collected, the State will receive twenty per cent and the respective county will receive eighty per cent (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt). The judiciary will also see an increase in revenue through a new administrative fee of $20 (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt) for each fireworks infraction, which will be deposited into the judiciary computer system special fund (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt).",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "This measure is not expected to have any capital expenditure impact. The provided legislative documents do not specify any new requirements for facilities, equipment, or technology infrastructure. The adjudication of fireworks infractions will be incorporated into the existing adjudication process for traffic and emergency period infractions (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt).",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The fiscal implications of this measure are expected to be ongoing beyond the initial six-year period. The revenue streams created from fines and administrative fees are not subject to a sunset clause and will continue as long as the law is in effect and enforced. The long-term financial impact will remain dependent on the number of violations and the level of enforcement activity.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The primary update from the previous fiscal note is the removal of funding from the bill. The Conference Committee Report for H.B. No. 1483, H.D. 1, S.D. 1, C.D. 1 specifies that Your Committee on Conference has amended this measure by 'Deleting the appropriation' (HB1483_CD1_CCR233_.HTM.txt). This is a significant change from the prior version of the bill, which had been amended to appropriate funds."
