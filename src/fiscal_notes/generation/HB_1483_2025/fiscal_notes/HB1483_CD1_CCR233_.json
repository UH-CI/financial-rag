  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fireworks infractions system will allow law enforcement agencies and the judiciary to quickly and efficiently process low-level cases, while also allowing them to prioritize higher-level cases as appropriate. [12] An expeditious adjudication system for fireworks infractions, such as the system for processing traffic infractions, will allow the judiciary to expediently process violations of the fireworks control law.
