  "overview": "The purpose of this measure is to establish various criminal offenses and penalties related to fireworks or articles pyrotechnic and amend and establish various definitions and penalties for fireworks offenses, including establishing heightened penalties under certain circumstances. [13] It seeks to facilitate more effective enforcement of Hawaiiâ€™s fireworks control laws by strengthening and clarifying existing criminal fireworks offenses, establishing new fireworks offenses, and establishing non-criminal fireworks infractions for the lowest-level offenses. [11] [11] The measure also incorporates fireworks infractions into the existing adjudication process for traffic and emergency period infractions. [13]",
  "appropriations": "Your Committee on Conference has amended this measure by deleting the appropriation. [13] Although the Hawaii County Police Department noted the bill included a monetary appropriation in amounts yet to be determined, the final version of the bill removes this funding. [11] [13] Therefore, this Act no longer appropriates funds. [13]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The legislature finds that improved enforcement of the fireworks control laws is necessary to protect property from avoidable fire damage and to protect the community from fire- and explosion-related injuries. [12] [12] The legislature believes that a more robust continuum of enforcement mechanisms must be established to promote compliance with the fireworks control laws. [12] [12] The fireworks infractions system is designed to allow law enforcement agencies and the judiciary to quickly and efficiently process low-level cases, while also allowing them to prioritize higher-level cases as appropriate. [12]",
  "agency_impact": "The bill addresses concerns raised by prosecutors and provides clarity and efficiency for law enforcement, prosecutors, and courts that handle these cases. [11] The fireworks infractions system will allow law enforcement agencies and the judiciary to quickly and efficiently process low-level cases. [12] A law enforcement officer could issue multiple fireworks citations without having to spend additional time interviewing witnesses, collecting evidence, or writing police reports, all of which may be necessary when trying to build a criminal case. [11]",
  "economic_impact": "The legislature finds that the widespread use of illegal fireworks poses an extreme danger and lethal risk to public health and safety, resulting in fires, serious burn injuries, and fatalities to innocent bystanders. [12] The cost to the community far outweighs any intrinsic benefit, as numerous lives have been lost over the years from the use of illegal fireworks. [12] [12] Improved enforcement of the fireworks control laws is necessary to protect property from avoidable fire damage. [12]",
  "policy_impact": "This Act establishes various criminal offenses and penalties related to fireworks or articles pyrotechnic and amends and establishes various definitions and penalties for fireworks offenses. [12] The bill amends existing criminal fireworks offenses to include wording and standards that are more amenable to prosecution, and penalties that are more proportionate to the prohibited acts. [11] The measure also incorporates fireworks infractions into the existing adjudication process for traffic and emergency period infractions. [12]",
  "revenue_sources": "Revenue will be generated from various fees and fines established by the bill. [12] [12] A permit is required for the purchase and use of consumer fireworks commonly known as firecrackers upon payment of a fee of $25 (The legislative document specifies $25.00 (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt)), and for any aerial devices or display fireworks upon payment of a fee of $110 (The legislative document specifies $110.00 (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt)). [12] [12] The court shall collect the fines imposed for violations, and of the fines collected, shall pay twenty per cent to the State and eighty per cent to the county in which the fine was imposed. [12]",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The measure no longer contains an appropriation, as it was deleted by the Conference Committee. [13] Fiscal implications will arise from new and amended fines and permit fees, which will generate recurring revenue for the State and counties. [12] Permit fees include $25 (The legislative document specifies $25.00 (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt)) for consumer fireworks and $110 (The legislative document specifies $110.00 (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt)) for aerial devices. [12] [12] A person who violates consumer fireworks prohibitions shall be subject to a $200 (The legislative document specifies $200.00 (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt)) fine. [12] Fines for carriers range from $1,000 (The legislative document specifies $1,000.00 (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt)) to $5,000 (The legislative document specifies $5,000.00 (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt)) depending on the number of offenses. [12] [12] Any person violating any other provision of this chapter shall be fined no less than $500 (The legislative document specifies $500.00 (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt)) and no more than $5,000 (The legislative document specifies $5,000.00 (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt)) for each violation. [12] The court will impose an administrative fee of $20 (The legislative document specifies $20.00 (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt)) for each fireworks infraction, which will be deposited into the judiciary computer system special fund. [12] [12] Of the fines collected, eighty per cent will be expended by the county for law enforcement purposes and twenty per cent will be paid to the State. [12] The bill does not specify any new staffing requirements or program expansion costs. [12] The financial impact over the next six years will depend on the volume of permits issued and the level of enforcement and adjudication of violations. [12]",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The measure is expected to increase operating revenue for the State and counties through a schedule of fines and fees. [12] A permit for consumer fireworks requires payment of a fee of $25 (The legislative document specifies $25.00 (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt)), while a permit for aerial devices has a fee of $110 (The legislative document specifies $110.00 (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt)). [12] [12] Fines for violations will be collected by the court, with twenty per cent paid to the State and eighty per cent to the respective county for law enforcement purposes. [12]",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The provided documents do not specify any capital expenditures. [12] The measure focuses on amending statutory definitions, penalties, and adjudication procedures rather than funding new facilities or infrastructure. [12] The bill does establish an administrative fee of $20 (The legislative document specifies $20.00 (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt)) per fireworks infraction to be deposited into the judiciary computer system special fund, which supports technology, but this does not constitute a new capital expenditure. [12] [12]",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The fiscal implications of this measure are expected to be ongoing beyond the initial six-year period. [12] The revenue generated from permit fees and fines for violations is recurring and not subject to a sunset clause. [12] [12] The long-term fiscal impact will be contingent on the sustained enforcement of the fireworks control laws and the number of permits issued and violations adjudicated. [12]",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The most significant change from the previous fiscal note is the deletion of the appropriation by the Committee on Conference. [13] While the previous note mentioned an appropriation of an unspecified amount, this measure now contains no state funding. [13] This new fiscal note is based on the final version of the bill (C.D. 1) and related testimony, which provides specific dollar amounts for numerous fines and fees, such as a $25 (The legislative document specifies $25.00 (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt)) permit fee, a $300 (The legislative document specifies $300.00 (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt)) fine for certain infractions, and fines for carriers up to $5,000 (The legislative document specifies $5,000.00 (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt)), details that were not available previously. [12] [12] [12] The new documents also confirm the bill's intent to incorporate fireworks infractions into the existing adjudication system used for traffic infractions. [13]"
