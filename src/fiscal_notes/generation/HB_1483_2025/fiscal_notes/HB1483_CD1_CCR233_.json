  "overview": "The Conference Committee has finalized HB1483 CD1, a measure to strengthen Hawaii's fireworks laws by establishing new criminal offenses, amending penalties, and creating a new adjudication process for fireworks infractions (HB1483_CD1_CCR233_). Key components include a tiered penalty system based on weight or injury caused and integrating low-level violations into the existing traffic infraction system (HB1483_CD1). A notable amendment provides that the limitation on the number of permits a person may obtain does not apply to permits for professional uses like aerial devices and display fireworks (HB1483_CD1_CCR233_).",
  "appropriations": "The Conference Committee has amended the measure by deleting the appropriation (HB1483_CD1_CCR233_). The final version of the bill, HB1483 CD1, contains no appropriation of funds for its implementation (HB1483_CD1). This is a significant change from the previous version, which included an appropriation of an unspecified amount (HB1483_CD1_CCR233_).",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "",
  "agency_impact": "The final version of the bill creates a new administrative framework by incorporating fireworks infractions into the adjudication process for traffic infractions under chapter 291D, Hawaii Revised Statutes (HB1483_CD1). This is intended to allow law enforcement and the judiciary to process low-level violations more efficiently (HB1483_CD1). The bill also creates a new requirement for shipping carriers to notify the state fire marshal of all incoming fireworks shipments, adding a new regulatory duty (HB1483_CD1).",
  "economic_impact": "To mitigate impacts on the professional pyrotechnics industry, the final bill clarifies that the limit on the number of permits a person can obtain does not apply to permits for aerial devices or display fireworks (HB1483_CD1_CCR233_). The bill will have a direct economic impact on violators through new fines, such as a $200 (HB1483_CD1) fine for consumer fireworks violations and a $300 (HB1483_CD1) fine for possessing small amounts of illegal aerial devices. Carriers who fail to comply with new notification requirements face fines escalating to $5,000 (HB1483_CD1).",
  "policy_impact": "Having passed both legislative chambers, HB1483 CD1 represents the final policy for this session, establishing a comprehensive new enforcement framework for fireworks control (HB1483_CD1_CCR233_). The measure codifies a dual system for enforcement: a tiered structure of criminal penalties for serious offenses and a separate, non-criminal infraction system for lower-level violations (HB1483_CD1). By amending chapter 291D, Hawaii Revised Statutes, the bill formally integrates fireworks infractions into the state's streamlined adjudication process for traffic infractions, altering how these violations are handled by law enforcement and the courts (HB1483_CD1).",
  "revenue_sources": "The final bill establishes new revenue sources through fines and fees. The judiciary computer system special fund will receive revenue from a new administrative fee of $20 (HB1483_CD1) for each fireworks infraction where judgment is entered for the State. All other fines collected under this chapter will be distributed with eighty per cent allocated to the county where the fine was imposed for law enforcement purposes and twenty per cent to the State (HB1483_CD1).",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "With the appropriation deleted, the bill has no immediate general fund cost for implementation (HB1483_CD1_CCR233_). Over the next six years, fiscal impacts will be driven by indeterminate revenue from new fines and fees. A recurring revenue source will be a new $20 (HB1483_CD1) administrative fee on infractions, deposited into the judiciary computer system special fund (HB1483_CD1). Counties will receive eighty per cent of fines collected, and the State will receive twenty per cent, creating a variable, long-term revenue stream for both (HB1483_CD1). New fines include $200 (HB1483_CD1) for consumer fireworks permit violations and $300 (HB1483_CD1) for possessing less than five pounds of illegal aerials. The judiciary and county police will incur administrative costs to implement the new infraction system, which are not quantified but are expected to be offset by increased efficiency (HB1483_CD1). No new positions or capital costs are identified in the bill (HB1483_CD1).",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The measure is expected to generate new, ongoing operating revenue for the state and counties. The State will receive revenue from its twenty per cent share of fines collected for fireworks violations (HB1483_CD1). Additionally, the judiciary computer system special fund will receive all revenue from a new $20 (HB1483_CD1) administrative fee on each fireworks infraction. Counties will receive eighty per cent of collected fines, which must be expended for law enforcement purposes (HB1483_CD1).",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The final version of the bill does not authorize or require any capital expenditures (HB1483_CD1). The integration of fireworks infractions into the existing traffic and emergency period violations adjudication system is expected to utilize current judiciary and law enforcement infrastructure (HB1483_CD1). The measure does not specify any need for new facilities, technology, or equipment (HB1483_CD1).",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "Beyond the six-year period, the fiscal implications will consist of ongoing, though indeterminate, revenue from fines and fees for the state and counties (HB1483_CD1). The administrative costs for the judiciary and county police to manage the infraction system will become a permanent part of their operating budgets (HB1483_CD1). The long-term sustainability and fiscal impact of the program will be contingent on the level of enforcement and the corresponding revenue collected (HB1483_CD1).",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The most significant update is the deletion of the appropriation by the Conference Committee, leaving the final bill with no state funding for implementation (HB1483_CD1_CCR233_). The final bill establishes new, specific revenue sources not previously detailed: a $20 (HB1483_CD1) administrative fee for the judiciary's special fund and a distribution formula for fines, with 80% to counties and 20% to the state (HB1483_CD1). A key policy change was made to address industry concerns by exempting professional display permits from the new fifty-permit limit (HB1483_CD1_CCR233_). Finally, the bill has achieved final passage, moving its policy framework from committee recommendation to enacted law (HB1483_CD1_CCR233_)."
