  "overview": "The purpose of this Act is to establish various criminal offenses and penalties related to fireworks or articles pyrotechnic and amend and establish various definitions and penalties for fireworks offenses, including establishing heightened penalties under certain circumstances. [12] It also seeks to incorporate fireworks infractions into the existing adjudication process for traffic and emergency period infractions. [12] The bill addresses concerns raised by prosecutors and provides clarity and efficiency for law enforcement, prosecutors, and courts that handle these cases. [11]",
  "appropriations": "The purpose of this measure is to appropriate funds. [13] However, the Committee on Conference has amended this measure by deleting the appropriation. [13] <previous section>The previous fiscal note specified an appropriation of an unspecified sum for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027 to be expended by the judiciary, but the final version of the bill deletes the appropriation. [13]</previous section>",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The legislature believes that a more robust continuum of enforcement mechanisms must be established to promote compliance with the fireworks control laws. [12] The fireworks infractions system will allow law enforcement agencies and the judiciary to quickly and efficiently process low-level cases, while also allowing them to prioritize higher-level cases as appropriate. [12] Due to the lower standard of proof for fireworks infractions, these citations could be issued very quickly and easily, without requiring any further investigation. [11]",
  "agency_impact": "The Department of the Attorney General strongly supports this bill. [11] The Honolulu Police Department (HPD) supports this bill which seeks to clarify the definitions of fireworks and improve enforcement. [11] The Hawaii County Police Department and the Department of the Prosecuting Attorney, County of Maui also submitted testimony in support of the measure. [11] [11]",
  "economic_impact": "Any person who violates the consumer fireworks prohibitions shall be subject to a $200.00 (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt) fine for purchasing or possessing without a permit, and a $1,000.00 (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt) fine for improper distribution. [12] [12] Penalties for standalone offenses range from an infraction carrying only a $200.00 (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt) fine, to class C felonies facing up to a $10,000.00 (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt) fine. [11] [11] Fines for carriers range from $1,000.00 (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt) for a first offense to $5,000.00 (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt) for a third offense, while other violations can be fined no less than $500.00 (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt) and no more than $5,000.00 (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt). [12] [12] [12]",
  "policy_impact": "This bill amends existing criminal fireworks offenses to include wording and standards that are more amenable to prosecution, and penalties that are more proportionate to the prohibited acts. [11] The measure establishes new offenses, such as sending or receiving fireworks by air delivery and refusal to provide identification. [11] [11] It incorporates fireworks infractions into the existing adjudication process for traffic and emergency period infractions under chapter 291D, HRS. [12] [11]",
  "revenue_sources": "A permit for consumer fireworks commonly known as firecrackers requires payment of a fee of $25.00 (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt), while a permit for aerial devices requires a fee of $110.00 (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt). [12] [12] In addition to any monetary assessment imposed for a fireworks infraction, the court shall impose an administrative fee of $20.00 (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt) for each fireworks infraction in which judgment is entered in favor of the State, to be deposited into the judiciary computer system special fund. [12] [12] Of the fines collected for violating this chapter, the court shall pay twenty per cent to the State and eighty per cent to the county in which the fine was imposed, which shall be expended by the county for law enforcement purposes. [12]",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The bill establishes a new system for adjudicating non-criminal fireworks infractions, which will create ongoing operational responsibilities for the judiciary. [12] Law enforcement agencies will be impacted by the new offenses and enforcement procedures, such as issuing citations for infractions similar to non-criminal traffic citations. [11] This will allow law enforcement agencies and courts to hold a much higher number of individuals accountable for their use of illicit fireworks quickly and safely and thus make more efficient use of limited resources. [11] The bill establishes a variety of new fines and fees that will generate recurring revenue for the State and counties. [12] [12] [12] For a first offense, a carrier shipping fireworks improperly shall be subject to a $1,000.00 (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt) fine. [12] For a second offense committed within five years, the fine increases to $2,000.00 (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt). [12] A third or subsequent offense within five years is subject to a $5,000.00 (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt) fine. [12] Purchasing certain fireworks without a permit results in a $300.00 (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt) fine. [12] An administrative fee of $20.00 (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt) will be imposed for each fireworks infraction. [12] [12] Permit fees include $25.00 (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt) for firecrackers and $110.00 (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt) for aerial devices. [12] [12]",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The measure will increase operating revenue through a series of new and amended fines and fees. [12] Revenue will be generated from permit fees, including a $25.00 (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt) fee for firecracker permits and a $110.00 (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt) fee for aerial device permits. [12] [12] Additional revenue will come from an administrative fee of $20.00 (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt) for each fireworks infraction and various fines, such as the $300.00 (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt) fine for possessing small amounts of illegal fireworks. [12] [12]",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "No direct capital expenditures are specified in the bill. [13] However, the bill requires that administrative fees of $20.00 (HB1483_CD1_.HTM.txt) collected for each fireworks infraction be deposited into the judiciary computer system special fund. [12] This suggests that funds generated by the measure may be used for technology infrastructure and systems within the judiciary. [12]",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The establishment of a permanent adjudication system for fireworks infractions will result in ongoing operational costs for the judiciary. [12] Similarly, the creation of new criminal offenses and enforcement mechanisms will represent a recurring cost for state and county law enforcement agencies. [11] [11] These long-term costs will be partially offset by recurring revenue from the system of fines and fees established in the bill. [12] [12]",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The most significant change from the previous fiscal note is the deletion of the appropriation, which was removed by the Committee on Conference. [13] The previous note mentioned an appropriation of an unspecified sum, but the final version of the bill contains no funding. [13] This new fiscal note includes specific fine, fee, and penalty amounts drawn directly from the final bill text (HB1483 CD1), providing financial details that were noted as absent from the committee report referenced in the prior fiscal note. [12] [12] [12] [12] The core policy changes, agency impacts, and rationale for the bill remain consistent with the previous analysis. [13]"
