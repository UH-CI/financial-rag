  "overview": "The purpose of this measure is to establish an adjudication system and procedures to process fireworks infractions. [4] It also amends and establishes various definitions and penalties for fireworks offenses, including establishing heightened penalties under certain circumstances, and establishes various criminal offenses and penalties related to fireworks or articles pyrotechnics. [4] Creating a fireworks infractions system will allow law enforcement agencies and the judiciary to quickly and efficiently process low-level cases, while also allowing them to prioritize higher-level cases as appropriate. [3]",
  "appropriations": "There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $ or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2025-2026 and the same sum or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2026-2027 to carry out the purposes of this Act. [3] This includes funds to update the judiciary information management system to implement the adjudications process established by section 2 of this Act. [3] The sums appropriated shall be expended by the judiciary for the purposes of this Act. [3]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal impact is based on the appropriation of funds to update the judiciary information management system. [3] Revenue projections are based on the collection of various fines, fees, and monetary assessments established in the measure. [3] The methodology assumes that the new adjudication system will process violations, generating revenue from penalties such as an administrative fee of $20 (HB1483_HD1_.HTM.txt) for each fireworks infraction in which judgment is entered in favor of the State. [CHUNK_225, NUMBER_0]",
  "agency_impact": "This measure will require the judiciary to implement a new adjudication system for fireworks infractions, similar to the existing traffic infraction system. [3] The Department of Law Enforcement (DLE) was concerned about a potential repeal of its ability to assist fire departments with inspections, but the amended version restores the authority of law enforcement officers to conduct inspections. [2] [4] The prosecuting attorney of the county in which the fireworks infraction occurred will represent the State at the time of trial. [3]",
  "economic_impact": "The legislature finds that the widespread use of illegal fireworks poses an extreme danger and lethal risk to public health and safety, and the cost to the community far outweighs any intrinsic benefit. [3] The court shall collect the fines imposed for violating this chapter and shall pay twenty per cent to the State and eighty per cent to the county in which the fine was imposed, which shall be expended by the county for law enforcement purposes. [3] Improved enforcement of the fireworks control laws is necessary to protect property from avoidable fire damage and the community from fire- and explosion-related injuries. [3]",
  "policy_impact": "This measure establishes a new chapter in the Hawaii Revised Statutes for the adjudication of fireworks infractions. [3] The Committee on Judiciary & Hawaiian Affairs amended the measure to clarify the definitions of \"aerial device\", \"consumer fireworks\", and \"fireworks\", and clarify the weight thresholds for certain penalties for fireworks offenses. [4] The bill also restores the authority of law enforcement officers to conduct inspections to verify compliance with fireworks laws and changes the effective date to July 1, 3000, to encourage further discussion. [4] [4]",
  "revenue_sources": "The measure appropriates an unspecified sum from the general revenues of the State of Hawaii. [3] Revenue will be generated from an administrative fee of $20 (HB1483_HD1_.HTM.txt) for each fireworks infraction where judgment is entered for the State. [CHUNK_225, NUMBER_0] Other revenue sources include permit fees, such as $25 (HB1483_HD1_.HTM.txt) for consumer fireworks and $110 (HB1483_HD1_.HTM.txt) for aerial devices, and fines ranging from $200 (HB1483_HD1_.HTM.txt) to $5,000 (HB1483_HD1_.HTM.txt) for various offenses. [CHUNK_352, CHUNK_353, CHUNK_281, CHUNK_385, NUMBER_6, NUMBER_7, NUMBER_1, NUMBER_13]",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The bill appropriates an unspecified amount from general revenues for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027 to update the judiciary information management system. [3] Ongoing revenue will be generated through several mechanisms. [3] The court shall impose an administrative fee of $20 (HB1483_HD1_.HTM.txt) for each fireworks infraction in which judgment is entered in favor of the State. [CHUNK_225, NUMBER_0] Permit fees are established at $25 (HB1483_HD1_.HTM.txt) for consumer fireworks and $110 (HB1483_HD1_.HTM.txt) for aerial devices and articles pyrotechnic. [CHUNK_352, CHUNK_353, NUMBER_6, NUMBER_7] A person who violates consumer fireworks prohibitions shall be subject to a $200 (HB1483_HD1_.HTM.txt) fine for certain offenses and a $1,000 (HB1483_HD1_.HTM.txt) fine for others. [CHUNK_281, NUMBER_1, NUMBER_2] Fines for carriers range from $1,000 (HB1483_HD1_.HTM.txt) for a first offense to $2,000 (HB1483_HD1_.HTM.txt) for a second offense and $5,000 (HB1483_HD1_.HTM.txt) for a third offense. [CHUNK_289, CHUNK_290, NUMBER_3, NUMBER_4, NUMBER_5] Violations not otherwise specified are subject to a fine of no less than $500 (HB1483_HD1_.HTM.txt) and no more than $5,000 (HB1483_HD1_.HTM.txt). [CHUNK_385, NUMBER_12, NUMBER_13] Of the fines collected, eighty per cent will be paid to the county in which the fine was imposed for law enforcement purposes, and twenty per cent will be paid to the State. [3] The long-term fiscal implications depend on the enforcement and adjudication volume, but the bill has an effective date of July 1, 3000. [3]",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "This bill is expected to generate operating revenue for both the State and counties. [3] Revenue will be generated from a new administrative fee of $20 (HB1483_HD1_.HTM.txt) imposed by the court for each fireworks infraction where judgment is entered in favor of the State. [CHUNK_225, NUMBER_0] Additionally, fines for offenses, which can be no less than $500 (HB1483_HD1_.HTM.txt) and no more than $5,000 (HB1483_HD1_.HTM.txt) for certain violations, will provide an ongoing source of revenue, with eighty per cent allocated to the counties for law enforcement purposes. [CHUNK_385, CHUNK_387, NUMBER_12, NUMBER_13]",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The measure appropriates an unspecified amount of funds for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027. [3] These funds are designated to update the judiciary information management system. [3] This update is required to implement the new adjudications process for fireworks infractions established by the Act. [3]",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "Given the bill's effective date is July 1, 3000, there are no fiscal implications after six years from the current date. [3] If the effective date were amended, ongoing annual operating costs for the judiciary would be required to administer the adjudication system. [3] The revenue from fines and fees would be continuous, with eighty per cent of fines collected being directed to the counties for law enforcement purposes. [3]",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "This fiscal note is based on H.B. No. 1483, H.D. 1, which has been amended by the Committee on Judiciary & Hawaiian Affairs. [4] A key change from the previous version of the bill is the restoration of the authority of law enforcement officers to conduct inspections, addressing a concern previously raised by the Department of Law Enforcement about a potential repeal of this authority. [4] [2] The committee also amended the offense of general fireworks or articles pyrotechnic prohibitions in the second degree, clarified definitions, and clarified weight thresholds for certain penalties. [4] [4] Critically for fiscal planning, the effective date of the measure has been changed to July 1, 3000, to encourage further discussion, which defers all fiscal impacts until that time. [4]"
