This testimony highlights a potential negative economic impact on a local business by unintentionally restricting legally permitted operations (HB1483_TESTIMONY_JHA_02-06-25_). Amendments were requested to ensure professional licensed fireworks productions are properly categorized and allowed to continue operating legally (HB1483_TESTIMONY_JHA_02-06-25_).",

The Department of the Attorney General and the Department of Law Enforcement testified in strong support, noting that current laws create roadblocks to effective prosecution and enforcement (HB1483_TESTIMONY_JHA_02-06-25_). Opposition testimony from Hawaii Pyrotechnics and Explosives LLC raised concerns about the bill's negative economic impact on licensed, professional fireworks companies (HB1483_TESTIMONY_JHA_02-06-25_). The House Committee on Judiciary & Hawaiian Affairs subsequently amended the bill (HB1483_HD1) to clarify definitions and penalties, and restored the authority of law enforcement officers to conduct inspections, addressing a specific concern raised in testimony by the Department of Law Enforcement (HB1483_HD1_HSCR629_)."
