  "overview": "The purpose of this measure is to establish an adjudication system and procedures to process fireworks infractions, amend and establish various definitions and penalties for fireworks offenses, and establish various criminal offenses and penalties related to fireworks or articles pyrotechnics. [4] [4] This measure would largely address the concerns raised by prosecutors and provide greater clarity and efficiency for law enforcement, prosecutors, and the courts. [4] Creating a fireworks infractions system will allow law enforcement agencies and the judiciary to quickly and efficiently process low-level cases, while also allowing them to prioritize higher-level cases as appropriate. [3]",
  "appropriations": "There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $ or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2025-2026 and the same sum or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2026-2027. [3] These funds are to carry out the purposes of this Act, including to update the judiciary information management system to implement the adjudications process established by section 2 of this Act. [3] The sums appropriated shall be expended by the judiciary for the purposes of this Act. [3]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "Fiscal projections are based on the establishment of a dedicated adjudication system for fireworks infractions, similar to the existing traffic infraction system. [3] Revenue calculations are based on new fees and fines, such as a fee of the legislative document specifies $25 (HB1483_HD1_.HTM.txt) for a permit to purchase consumer fireworks commonly known as firecrackers and a fee of the legislative document specifies $110 (HB1483_HD1_.HTM.txt) for aerial devices or display fireworks permits. [3] [3] Additional revenue is based on new fines, including a the legislative document specifies $200 (HB1483_HD1_.HTM.txt) fine for unlawfully setting off consumer fireworks and fines for carriers ranging from the legislative document specifies $1,000 (HB1483_HD1_.HTM.txt) to the legislative document specifies $5,000 (HB1483_HD1_.HTM.txt). [3] [3] [3]",
  "agency_impact": "The judiciary will expend appropriated funds to update its information management system and will adjudicate fireworks infractions. [3] [3] The Department of Law Enforcement (DLE) will have restored authority to assist county fire departments with conducting inspections of fireworks licenses. [2] [4] The prosecuting attorney shall represent the State in any trial on a fireworks infraction. [3] [3]",
  "economic_impact": "The legislature finds that the widespread use of illegal fireworks poses an extreme danger and lethal risk to public health and safety, resulting in fires, serious burn injuries, and fatalities to innocent bystanders. [3] The purpose of this Act is to protect property from avoidable fire damage, and also to protect the community from fire- and explosion-related injuries and respiratory distress. [3] The bill imposes various fines, including a penalty of no less than the legislative document specifies $500 (HB1483_HD1_.HTM.txt) and no more than the legislative document specifies $5,000 (HB1483_HD1_.HTM.txt) for certain violations. [3]",
  "policy_impact": "This measure adds a new chapter to the Hawaii Revised Statutes to establish an adjudication system for fireworks infractions that shall be applied uniformly throughout the State. [3] [3] The Committee on Judiciary & Hawaiian Affairs amended this measure by clarifying the definitions of \"aerial device\", \"consumer fireworks\", and \"fireworks\"; clarifying the weight thresholds for certain penalties for fireworks offenses; and restoring the authority of law enforcement officers to conduct inspections. [4] The bill also establishes heightened penalties for offenses that result in substantial bodily injury, serious bodily injury, or death. [3]",
  "revenue_sources": "The bill appropriates an unspecified amount out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii. [3] Additional revenues are to be generated from fees and fines, including a permit fee of the legislative document specifies $25 (HB1483_HD1_.HTM.txt) for consumer fireworks and the legislative document specifies $110 (HB1483_HD1_.HTM.txt) for aerial devices. [3] [3] Of the fines collected, eighty per cent shall be paid to the county in which the fine was imposed for law enforcement purposes, and twenty per cent shall be paid to the State. [3] The court shall also impose an administrative fee of the legislative document specifies $20 (HB1483_HD1_.HTM.txt) for each fireworks infraction, which will be deposited into the judiciary computer system special fund. [3]",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "This measure, as amended, will have no fiscal implications within the next six years. [3] The Committee on Judiciary & Hawaiian Affairs amended this measure by changing the effective date to July 1, 3000, to encourage further discussion. [4] Consequently, the appropriation from general revenues for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027 to update the judiciary information management system will not occur within the six-year period. [3] [3] All potential revenues from new fees and fines are also deferred, including the legislative document specifies $25 (HB1483_HD1_.HTM.txt) fee for consumer fireworks permits and the legislative document specifies $110 (HB1483_HD1_.HTM.txt) fee for aerial device permits. [3] [3] Fines, such as those for carriers which range from the legislative document specifies $1,000 (HB1483_HD1_.HTM.txt) to the legislative document specifies $5,000 (HB1483_HD1_.HTM.txt), will not be collected. [3] [3] The provision to distribute fine revenue between the State and counties will not take effect. [3] Thus, the previous fiscal note's analysis of immediate fiscal impacts is no longer applicable for the six-year planning period. [4]",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "As amended, this measure will have no impact on operating revenues within the six-year fiscal period. [3] The committee changed the effective date to July 1, 3000, to encourage further discussion. [4] Therefore, the collection of new permit fees, fines, and the administrative fee of the legislative document specifies $20 (HB1483_HD1_.HTM.txt) is deferred, and no new operating revenue will be generated. [3] [3]",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "There are no capital expenditures anticipated within the six-year planning period as a result of this measure. [3] Although the bill appropriates funds to update the judiciary information management system, this expenditure is deferred because the bill's amended effective date is July 1, 3000. [3] [4] The previous fiscal note's analysis of an immediate capital expenditure is no longer applicable. [4]",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "There are no fiscal implications after six years because the bill's effective date has been changed to July 1, 3000. [3] [4] The establishment of the new adjudication system and all associated ongoing operating costs and revenues are deferred until that date. [3] Consequently, there are no ongoing fiscal obligations for the State in the period immediately following the next six years. [3]",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The most significant update from the previous fiscal note is the change in the measure's effective date to July 1, 3000, which defers all fiscal impacts. [4] Consequently, the previous fiscal noteâ€™s analysis regarding immediate appropriations, revenues, and expenditures is no longer applicable. [3] Policy changes in this amended version of the bill include clarifying the definitions of various types of fireworks, clarifying weight thresholds for penalties, and restoring the authority of law enforcement officers to conduct inspections.
