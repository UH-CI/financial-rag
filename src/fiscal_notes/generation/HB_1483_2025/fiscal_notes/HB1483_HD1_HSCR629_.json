  "overview": "This measure, as amended in H.D. 1, refines the state's approach to fireworks enforcement by incorporating feedback from state agencies. Key changes include amending the offense of general fireworks prohibitions to include acts like throwing or manually propelling ignited fireworks and clarifying statutory definitions for 'aerial device' and 'consumer fireworks'. The amended bill also restores the authority of law enforcement officers to conduct inspections, addressing a key concern raised by the Department of Law Enforcement.",

  "agency_impact": "The amended bill directly addresses concerns raised in testimony from the Department of Law Enforcement (DLE) and the Department of the Attorney General (AG). Specifically, H.D. 1 restores the DLE's authority to assist with fireworks license inspections, a function the agency stated was still needed. The measure also adopts many of the AGâ€™s recommendations to clarify definitions and offense classifications, which is anticipated to resolve roadblocks to effective prosecution and provide greater efficiency for law enforcement and the courts.",
  "economic_impact": "Testimony submitted on the measure indicates potential economic effects not previously detailed. A licensed pyrotechnics company testified that the bill as originally written could severely impact its ability to operate, suggesting a negative economic effect on legally-operating small businesses in the industry. Conversely, public testimony highlighted costs associated with illegal fireworks, such as property damage from explosions and fires, implying potential cost savings to residents from more effective enforcement.",
  "policy_impact": "The policy has been refined in H.D. 1 to more effectively target specific enforcement challenges identified by the Attorney General. The measure clarifies weight thresholds for offenses and establishes that strict liability applies in certain circumstances, which is intended to lower the burden of proof for prosecutors. The decision to restore DLE inspection authority via amendment reaffirms the policy of supporting inter-agency cooperation in fireworks enforcement.",

  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "This fiscal note is based on H.B. 1483, H.D. 1, and related testimony, which provides significant updates from the previous version. The bill was substantively amended to address concerns from the Department of Law Enforcement by restoring its inspection authority and incorporated specific recommendations from the Attorney General to clarify offenses, definitions, and penalties to aid in prosecution. New information from testimony revealed potential economic impacts on licensed pyrotechnics businesses and costs to private citizens from property damage, which were not previously documented. While the fiscal impact remains indeterminate due to an unspecified appropriation, the operational and policy impacts are now more clearly defined based on these amendments."
