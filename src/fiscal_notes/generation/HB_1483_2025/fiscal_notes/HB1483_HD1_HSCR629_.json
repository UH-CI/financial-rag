  "overview": "The purpose of this measure is to establish an adjudication system and procedures to process fireworks infractions, amend and establish various definitions and penalties for fireworks offenses, and establish various criminal offenses and penalties related to fireworks or articles pyrotechnics. [4] The legislature believes a more robust continuum of enforcement mechanisms must be established to promote compliance with the fireworks control laws, including a dedicated adjudication system for fireworks infractions, similar to the existing traffic infraction system. [3] Creating a fireworks infractions system will allow law enforcement agencies and the judiciary to quickly and efficiently process low-level cases, while also allowing them to prioritize higher-level cases as appropriate. [3]",
  "appropriations": "There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $ or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2025-2026 and the same sum or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2026-2027 to carry out the purposes of this Act. [3] The appropriated funds are for purposes including to update the judiciary information management system to implement the adjudications process established by section 2 of this Act. [3] The sums appropriated shall be expended by the judiciary for the purposes of this Act. [3]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The provided documents do not specify the assumptions or methodology used for the fiscal projections. [4] It is noted that it has been difficult for state and county agencies to enforce or prosecute illegal fireworks cases in the State due to challenges with gathering evidence, meeting the high burden of proof necessary for convictions, and stringent definitions. [4] The fiscal impact is based on the creation of a new adjudication system, an appropriation for the judiciary, and the establishment of new fines and fees for violations. [3]",
  "agency_impact": "This bill establishes a dedicated adjudication system for fireworks infractions, which will require the judiciary to process these low-level cases quickly and efficiently. [3] The judiciary's information management system will need to be updated to implement the new adjudications process. [3] The measure also restores the authority of law enforcement officers to conduct inspections to verify compliance with fireworks laws. [4]",
  "economic_impact": "The legislature finds that the widespread use of illegal fireworks poses an extreme danger and lethal risk to public health and safety, resulting in fires, serious burn injuries, and fatalities to innocent bystanders. [3] The measure aims to reduce these societal costs and also generates revenue through new fines and fees. [3] This includes a $20 (HB1483_HD1_.HTM.txt) administrative fee for each fireworks infraction [CHUNK_226, NUMBER_0], a $25 (HB1483_HD1_.HTM.txt) permit fee for firecrackers [CHUNK_352, NUMBER_6], and various fines for violations ranging from $500 (HB1483_HD1_.HTM.txt) to $5,000 (HB1483_HD1_.HTM.txt). [CHUNK_385, NUMBER_12] [CHUNK_385, NUMBER_13]",
  "policy_impact": "This Act establishes a new chapter in the Hawaii Revised Statutes to create a dedicated adjudication system for fireworks infractions. [3] The measure amends and establishes various definitions and penalties for fireworks offenses and clarifies the definitions of 'aerial device', 'consumer fireworks', and 'fireworks'. [4] It also confers concurrent jurisdiction on a district court to hear and dispose of cases of fireworks infractions by children. [3]",
  "revenue_sources": "Revenue to support the bill's provisions will be generated from monetary assessments, fees, and fines. [3] A permit for consumer fireworks commonly known as firecrackers requires a fee of $25 (HB1483_HD1_.HTM.txt), while a permit for aerial devices and other pyrotechnics requires a fee of $110 (HB1483_HD1_.HTM.txt). [CHUNK_352, NUMBER_6] [CHUNK_353, NUMBER_7] The court shall impose an administrative fee of $20 (HB1483_HD1_.HTM.txt) for each fireworks infraction where judgment is entered for the State, which is deposited into the judiciary computer system special fund. [CHUNK_226, NUMBER_0] Of the fines collected, eighty per cent shall be paid to the county in which the fine was imposed for law enforcement purposes, and twenty per cent shall be paid to the State. [3]",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The bill appropriates an unspecified sum for fiscal year 2025-2026 and fiscal year 2026-2027 to update the judiciary information management system. [3] This represents an initial cost to implement the new adjudication process. [3] The new system will create ongoing operational costs for the judiciary and law enforcement agencies. [3] The measure also establishes new recurring revenue streams from fees and fines. [3] Permit fees include $25 (HB1483_HD1_.HTM.txt) for firecrackers and $110 (HB1483_HD1_.HTM.txt) for aerial devices. [CHUNK_352, NUMBER_6] [CHUNK_353, NUMBER_7] Fines include $200 (HB1483_HD1_.HTM.txt) for certain consumer fireworks violations [CHUNK_281, NUMBER_1], $1,000 (HB1483_HD1_.HTM.txt) for a first-time carrier offense [CHUNK_289, NUMBER_3], and up to $5,000 (HB1483_HD1_.HTM.txt) for other violations. [CHUNK_385, NUMBER_11] An administrative fee of $20 (HB1483_HD1_.HTM.txt) is also imposed for each infraction. [CHUNK_226, NUMBER_0] However, the committee amended the measure by changing the effective date to July 1, 3000, to encourage further discussion. [4] Consequently, there are no fiscal implications for the State within the six-year planning horizon. [3]",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The measure will increase operating revenues for the State and counties through the collection of new fines, fees, and monetary assessments. [3] Revenue sources include a $25 (HB1483_HD1_.HTM.txt) fee for consumer fireworks permits and a $20 (HB1483_HD1_.HTM.txt) administrative fee for each infraction that is deposited into the judiciary computer system special fund. [CHUNK_352, NUMBER_6] [CHUNK_226, NUMBER_0] Fines collected for violations are split, with eighty per cent allocated to the county for law enforcement purposes and twenty per cent to the State, though these impacts are delayed until the bill's effective date. [3] [3]",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The bill appropriates an unspecified amount of funds to update the judiciary information management system. [3] This expenditure is for the implementation of the new adjudications process for fireworks infractions and will be expended by the judiciary. [3] The provided text does not specify any other capital expenditures, and this fiscal impact is postponed until the bill's effective date of July 1, 3000. [3]",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "After the initial six-year period, the adjudication system for fireworks infractions will represent an ongoing operational cost for the judiciary and law enforcement. [3] Revenue from the established fines and fees is expected to be recurring, providing a continuous source of funds for the State and counties. [3] However, all fiscal implications are postponed until the effective date of July 1, 3000. [3]",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The most significant change from the previous fiscal note is the amended effective date of July 1, 3000, which postpones all fiscal impacts of the measure to encourage further discussion. [4] The previous fiscal note's analysis of immediate fiscal implications is therefore no longer relevant, as no financial effects will occur in the foreseeable future. [3] This amended version of the bill also clarifies the definitions of 'aerial device', 'consumer fireworks', and 'fireworks', and clarifies weight thresholds for certain penalties for fireworks offenses. [4] Additionally, this measure restores the authority of law enforcement officers to conduct inspections, addressing a concern raised by the Department of Law Enforcement in its testimony. [4] [2]"
