  "overview": "This measure has been amended to incorporate the fireworks infraction adjudication process into the existing system for traffic and emergency procedure violations, rather than establishing an entirely new, standalone specialty court. The bill's core purpose of creating new offenses and enhancing penalties remains, but the implementation framework for processing non-criminal infractions is now significantly different. These changes aim to streamline enforcement by leveraging a pre-existing judicial process.",
  "appropriations": "While the measure still appropriates funds, the intended use of the Judiciary's portion has been altered. The funds are now designated for integrating the new fireworks infraction caseload into the existing traffic and emergency violations adjudication system. This represents a shift from funding the creation of a new, separate court to funding the expansion of an existing one.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "",
  "agency_impact": "The operational impact on the Judiciary has been revised; it will now absorb fireworks infractions into its existing traffic court system, which changes the nature of the burden from establishing a new specialty court to managing an increased caseload within an established process. Amendments were also made to remove law enforcement officers from the definition of administrative \"inspector.\" The Office of the Public Defender's concerns about handling concurrent civil and criminal trials remain relevant under the integrated adjudication model.",
  "economic_impact": "Amendments were incorporated to mitigate previously identified negative economic impacts on the legal fireworks industry. The bill now includes specific exemptions that allow licensed wholesalers and retailers to lawfully purchase, possess, and distribute consumer fireworks in accordance with their licenses. This clarification is intended to prevent disruption to the supply chain for legal fireworks.",
  "policy_impact": "The measure's policy framework has been substantially revised to integrate fireworks infractions into the existing traffic violations adjudication process, a significant departure from the original proposal for a new specialty court. The bill now also explicitly clarifies that counties are not prohibited from enacting more stringent ordinances related to fireworks permits, addressing previous concerns about the preemption of local authority. Further amendments were made to define the lawful distribution of fireworks between licensed wholesalers and retailers.",
  "revenue_sources": "",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The fiscal outlook for the Judiciary has been modified, as integrating fireworks cases into the existing traffic court system is expected to have lower startup and administrative costs than creating a new specialty court. However, a sustained increase in recurring costs is still anticipated due to the higher caseload within that established system. The Department of Law Enforcement will continue to require ongoing appropriations to support the enhanced enforcement activities mandated by the bill, representing a consistent fiscal need over the six-year period.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The long-term fiscal obligations for the Judiciary are now associated with the permanent increase in case volume within the existing traffic and emergency violations system, rather than the operation of a separate court. This will require sustained operational funding. Likewise, funding for the Department of Law Enforcement's enhanced enforcement role will be a recurring need to maintain the bill's effectiveness beyond the initial six-year period.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "Key updates in this version include a fundamental change in the proposed adjudication system, which is now integrated into the existing traffic violations process instead of being a new, standalone specialty court. The measure was also amended to add specific exemptions for licensed fireworks distributors, mitigating potential negative economic impacts identified in earlier testimony. Additionally, policy concerns were addressed by clarifying that counties retain the authority to enact more stringent local ordinances."
