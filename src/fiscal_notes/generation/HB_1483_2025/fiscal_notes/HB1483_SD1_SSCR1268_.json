  "agency_impact": "Creating a fireworks infractions system will allow law enforcement agencies and the judiciary to quickly and efficiently process low-level cases, while also allowing them to prioritize higher-level cases as appropriate.

  "economic_impact": "The legislature finds that the widespread use of illegal fireworks poses an extreme danger, and the cost to the community far outweighs any intrinsic benefit. [8] With the increase in fireworks-related calls, public safety agencies are heavily strained to maintain adequate response levels for other critical emergencies, which adds to the cost of state and county resources. [8] The system of processing traffic infractions established by this chapter will save the taxpayers money and reduce their frustration with the judicial system by simplifying the traffic court process. [8]",

  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The legislative documents do not provide specific information on fiscal implications beyond the initial two-year appropriation period.

[8] [8]",
