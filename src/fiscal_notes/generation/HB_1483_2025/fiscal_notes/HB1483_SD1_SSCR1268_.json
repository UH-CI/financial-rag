  "overview": "The Committees on Public Safety and Military Affairs and Judiciary find that there is an urgent need for a more structured approach to fireworks enforcement in the State (HB1483_SD1). This measure will address critical weaknesses in the current regulatory framework by establishing a dedicated adjudication system that will streamline the processing of fireworks infractions, allowing for more efficient enforcement and prosecution (HB1483_SD1). This measure will also establish a graduated penalty structure that appropriately reflects the severity of violations, particularly those resulting in serious injury or death, which serves as both a deterrent and an appropriate response to the harm caused (HB1483_SD1).",

  "agency_impact": "The Committees have amended this measure based on testimony from the Department of the Attorney General (HB1483_SD1). Amendments specify that it shall be unlawful to purchase, possess, or use consumer fireworks without a permit, except that a person licensed may purchase or possess consumer fireworks in accordance with the person's license (HB1483_SD1). The measure was also amended by deleting law enforcement officer from the definition of \"inspector\" (HB1483_SD1).",

  "policy_impact": "The Committees have amended this measure by incorporating the fireworks violations adjudication process into the existing traffic and emergency procedure violations adjudication process within the Hawaii Revised Statutes (HB1483_SD1). The measure also clarifies that the counties are not prohibited from enacting ordinances pertaining to the issuance of fireworks permits that are more stringent than the restrictions found in the Hawaii Revised Statutes (HB1483_SD1). These changes address concerns previously raised about the creation of a new and potentially burdensome court process (HB1483_HD1_TESTIMONY_PSM-JDC_03-13-25_).",
  "revenue_sources": "The legislative document specifies new fines which would create new revenue streams. These include fines for carriers or persons, with a first offense subject to a $1,000 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt) fine, a second offense committed within five years subject to a $2,000 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt) fine, and a third or subsequent offense subject to a $5,000 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt) fine. Other violations of the chapter are subject to a fine no less than $500 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt) and no more than $5,000 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt) for each violation.",

  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "This fiscal note reflects significant amendments made in committee. The agency impact section now details adopted changes suggested by the Department of the Attorney General, including exemptions for licensed individuals and narrowing the definition of \"inspector.\" A key policy impact update is the incorporation of the fireworks adjudication process into the existing traffic violations system, instead of creating a costly new one, and a clarification of counties' authority to enact stricter ordinances. The revenue sources and operating revenue impact sections are now populated with specific fine amounts established in the bill, including escalating fines for carriers from $1,000 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt) to $5,000 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt) and general violation penalties."
