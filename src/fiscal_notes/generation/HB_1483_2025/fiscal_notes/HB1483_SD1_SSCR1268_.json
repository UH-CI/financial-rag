  "overview": "This measure has been amended to incorporate the fireworks violations adjudication process into the existing system for traffic and emergency procedure violations, streamlining enforcement (HB1483_SD1_SSCR1268_). The bill clarifies offenses related to aerial devices and consumer fireworks, and it refines regulations for licensed wholesalers and retailers (HB1483_SD1_SSCR1268_). The Senate committees found an urgent need for a more structured enforcement approach to address critical weaknesses in the current regulatory framework (HB1483_SD1_SSCR1268_).",

  "agency_impact": "The Senate committees adopted amendments suggested by the Department of the Attorney General, including clarifying language for permit and license holders and deleting 'law enforcement officer' from the definition of 'inspector' (HB1483_SD1_SSCR1268_). While support from law enforcement and fire departments is reaffirmed, the Office of the Public Defender strongly opposes the measure, citing significant constitutional and procedural concerns with the proposed 'concurrent trial' provision for civil infractions and criminal offenses (HB1483_HD1_TESTIMONY_PSM-JDC_03-13-25_). The Public Defender argues this process could violate a defendant's right against self-incrimination, right to effective counsel, and right to present a complete defense (HB1483_HD1_TESTIMONY_PSM-JDC_03-13-25_).",
  "economic_impact": "Industry stakeholders like TNT Fireworks and Phantom Fireworks continue to express concerns, proposing specific amendments to protect licensed distributors of legal consumer fireworks (HB1483_HD1_TESTIMONY_PSM-JDC_03-13-25_). TNT Fireworks requests a 'safe harbor' provision to allow the transport and storage of consumer fireworks across counties, provided they are intended for sale where permitted by local ordinance (HB1483_HD1_TESTIMONY_PSM-JDC_03-13-25_). These stakeholders argue that the measure unfairly penalizes businesses that sell legal products and diverts enforcement resources from the more significant problem of illegal aerial fireworks (HB1483_HD1_TESTIMONY_PSM-JDC_03-13-25_).",
  "policy_impact": "The measure's policy approach has been significantly refined by incorporating the fireworks violations adjudication process into the existing framework for traffic and emergency procedure violations (HB1483_SD1_SSCR1268_). The Office of the Public Defender argues this policy is misguided, asserting that the core issue is a lack of enforcement of current laws, not inadequate penalties, citing that 94% of citations on OÊ»ahu were dismissed or dropped between 2018 and 2022 (HB1483_HD1_TESTIMONY_PSM-JDC_03-13-25_). The Public Defender also raises substantial legal concerns that the 'concurrent trial' model is likely unconstitutional and procedurally unworkable (HB1483_HD1_TESTIMONY_PSM-JDC_03-13-25_).",
  "revenue_sources": "",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "By incorporating the fireworks adjudication process into the existing traffic court system, the long-term fiscal impact on the Judiciary may be less than creating a new, standalone system, as it can leverage existing infrastructure (HB1483_SD1_SSCR1268_). However, the documents provide no specific workload projections or cost estimates for additional court time, personnel, or administrative needs that would be required to handle a new category of infractions. The Office of the Public Defender's testimony raises concerns that creating a new adjudication system would be a 'costly specialty court,' a concern potentially mitigated but not eliminated by the integration with the traffic violation process (HB1483_HD1_TESTIMONY_PSM-JDC_03-13-25_). Without data on the expected volume of infractions, a six-year projection remains speculative.",

  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The most significant change is the amendment to incorporate the fireworks infraction adjudication process into the existing traffic and emergency violations system, rather than creating a new, standalone 'fireworks court' (HB1483_SD1_SSCR1268_). The Office of the Public Defender's opposition is now a central feature, raising detailed constitutional and procedural objections to the bill's 'concurrent trial' provision (HB1483_HD1_TESTIMONY_PSM-JDC_03-13-25_). The Senate committees also adopted several clarifying amendments proposed by the Attorney General, moving the bill from a proposal with suggested changes to an amended version (HB1483_SD1_SSCR1268_). Finally, industry stakeholders have refined their requests, now proposing specific 'safe harbor' amendments to protect the transport and storage of legal consumer fireworks across different counties (HB1483_HD1_TESTIMONY_PSM-JDC_03-13-25_)."
