  "overview": "The purpose and intent of this measure is to establish an adjudication system and procedures to process fireworks infractions. [9] It also amends multiple definitions and penalties for fireworks offenses, including heightened penalties if another person suffers substantial bodily injury, serious bodily injury, or death as a result of the fireworks offenses, and establishes various criminal offenses and penalties related to fireworks or articles pyrotechnics. [9] This measure will address critical weaknesses in the current regulatory framework by establishing a dedicated adjudication system that will streamline the processing of fireworks infractions, allowing for more efficient enforcement and prosecution. [9]",
  "appropriations": "There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii an unspecified sum for fiscal year 2025-2026 and the same sum for fiscal year 2026-2027 to carry out the purposes of this Act. [8] The sums appropriated shall be expended by the judiciary for the purposes of this Act. [8] Other legislation submitted this session appropriates funds for the DLE to conduct sting operations to enforce fireworks ordinance or laws. [7]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The legislature believes a more robust continuum of enforcement mechanisms must be established to promote compliance with the fireworks control laws. [8] Creating a fireworks infractions system will allow law enforcement agencies and the judiciary to quickly and efficiently process low-level cases, while also allowing them to prioritize higher-level cases as appropriate. [8] The Office of the Public Defender's testimony counters that it is the lack of enforcement, not the lack or severity of penalties, that has not deterred persons and businesses from ceasing illegal fireworks activities. [7]",
  "agency_impact": "The Department of the Prosecuting Attorney, County of Maui supports the bill because its increased penalties and proposed fireworks infraction adjudication process would help protect the community. [7] Conversely, the Office of the Public Defender (OPD) testified that a concurrent civil and criminal trial becomes a procedural nightmare due to different procedural rules. [7] The OPD would be assigned to represent an indigent defendant on a criminal fireworks charge but does not represent defendants in civil matters, requiring coordination with a pro se defendant. [7] [7]",
  "economic_impact": "Tragedies like the New Year's Eve explosion of 2024 have injured or claimed the lives of the elderly, adults, and children, seriously impacting entire neighborhoods. [8] Public safety agencies are heavily strained to maintain adequate response levels for other critical emergencies due to the increase in fireworks-related calls, which adds to the cost of state and county resources. [8] A Civil Beat investigation found that between 2018 and 2022, 94% of citations on OÊ»ahu were either dismissed or charges were dropped. [7]",
  "policy_impact": "This measure incorporates the fireworks violations adjudication process into the existing traffic and emergency procedure violations adjudication process within the Hawaii Revised Statutes. [9] The Office of the Public Defender notes that the bill authorizes a joint trial on a civil traffic violation and a criminal offense, which raises significant constitutional concerns and is likely illegal. [7] The measure also clarifies that counties are not prohibited from enacting ordinances pertaining to the issuance of fireworks permits that are more stringent than state law. [9]",
  "revenue_sources": "The bill appropriates funds out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027. [8] A new revenue stream is created through an administrative fee of $20 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt) for each fireworks infraction, which will be deposited into the judiciary computer system special fund. [8] Additional revenues will come from new fines, such as a $200 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt) fine for certain consumer fireworks violations and fines for carriers up to $5,000 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt) for failing to provide shipping notifications. [8] [8]",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The bill appropriates funds for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027 to be expended by the judiciary for the purposes of the Act. [8] [8] Recurring revenue will be generated from permit fees, including $25 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt) for consumer fireworks and $110 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt) for aerial devices. [8] [8] An administrative fee of $20 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt) per infraction will be deposited into the judiciary computer system special fund. [8] The Office of the Public Defender warns that the concurrent trial provision will inevitably lead to legal challenges, which will hinder enforcement. [7] The Illegal Fireworks Task Force has interdicted approximately 200,000 pounds of illegal fireworks since 2023, highlighting the scale of enforcement requiring ongoing funding. [7] Testimony describes the creation of a separate fireworks infraction system as a potentially costly specialty court. [7] The bill also establishes fines for carriers from $1,000 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt) up to $5,000 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt). [8] [8] A fine of $300 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt) is set for possession of less than five pounds of certain illegal fireworks, while other violations can be fined no less than $500 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt) and no more than $5,000 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt). [8] [8]",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "Any person who violates subsection (a) of the consumer fireworks prohibitions shall be subject to a $200 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt) fine. [8] A person who violates subsection (b) shall be subject to a $1,000 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt) fine. [8] In addition to any monetary assessment imposed for a fireworks infraction, the court shall impose an administrative fee of $20 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt) for each fireworks infraction in which judgment is entered in favor of the State, which will be deposited into the judiciary computer system special fund. [8] [8]",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The bill requires the court to impose an administrative fee of $20 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt) for each fireworks infraction where judgment is entered for the State. [8] The clerk of the district court shall deposit the administrative fees collected into the judiciary computer system special fund, indicating the funds are for technology infrastructure. [8] The provided documents do not specify any other capital expenditures. [8]",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The creation of a fireworks infractions system implies ongoing operational and personnel costs for the judiciary and law enforcement agencies beyond the initial six-year planning period. [8] The high number of fireworks being set off throughout the State will require sustained enforcement funding. [8] The administrative fee of $20 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt) per infraction will provide a recurring revenue stream for the judiciary computer system special fund. [8]",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "New information significantly details the bill's fiscal components, including specific new fines such as $200 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt) for illegal consumer fireworks use and up to $5,000 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt) for carriers, and permit fees of $25 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt) and $110 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt). [8] [8] [8] [8] A new administrative fee of $20 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt) per infraction is established to fund the judiciary computer system special fund. [8] The Office of the Public Defender's testimony introduces major new policy and fiscal considerations by challenging the constitutionality and procedural viability of the proposed \"concurrent trial\" system. [7] Furthermore, the committee report specifies numerous amendments, such as clarifying rules for licensed distributors and formally merging the fireworks adjudication process with the existing traffic violations system, which provides greater detail on the measure's updated structure.
