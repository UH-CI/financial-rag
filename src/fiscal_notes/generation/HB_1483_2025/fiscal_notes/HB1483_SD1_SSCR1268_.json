  "overview": "The purpose and intent of this measure is to establish an adjudication system and procedures to process fireworks infractions; amend multiple definitions and penalties for fireworks offenses, including heightened penalties if another person suffers substantial bodily injury, serious bodily injury, or death as a result of the fireworks offenses; establish various criminal offenses and penalties related to fireworks or articles pyrotechnics; and appropriate funds. [9] [9] [9] This measure will address critical weaknesses in the current regulatory framework by establishing a dedicated adjudication system that will streamline the processing of fireworks infractions, allowing for more efficient enforcement and prosecution. [9] Creating a fireworks infractions system will allow law enforcement agencies and the judiciary to quickly and efficiently process low-level cases, while also allowing them to prioritize higher-level cases as appropriate. [8]",
  "appropriations": "This Act appropriates an unspecified sum out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii for fiscal year 2025-2026 and the same sum for fiscal year 2026-2027 to carry out the purposes of this Act. [8] The sums appropriated shall be expended by the judiciary for the purposes of this Act. [8]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The legislature finds that an expeditious adjudication system for fireworks infractions, such as the system for processing traffic infractions, will allow the judiciary to expediently process violations of the fireworks control law. [8] This system will allow the judiciary to reserve resources for cases that require more resources. [8] Conversely, testimony from the Office of the Public Defender raises concerns that the bill's concurrent trial provision for civil infractions and criminal offenses is a \"procedural nightmare\" and likely unconstitutional. [7] [7]",
  "agency_impact": "This bill provides a more robust framework for enforcement for the Department of Law Enforcement (DLE). [7] The new system will enhance the ability of law enforcement to effectively address fireworks violations that endanger public safety, damage property, and disturb communities. [7] The Department of the Attorney General recommended amending the definition of \"inspector\" on page 72, line 8, by deleting the phrase, \"any law enforcement officer or . [7] . [7] .\" [7]",
  "economic_impact": "The widespread use of illegal fireworks poses an extreme danger and lethal risk to public health and safety, resulting in fires, serious burn injuries, and fatalities to innocent bystanders. [8] With the increase in fireworks-related calls, public safety agencies are heavily strained to maintain adequate response levels for other critical emergencies, which adds to the cost of state and county resources. [8] TNT Fireworks submitted testimony stating the measure may have negative repercussions for businesses, agencies, and the continued safe and responsible use of consumer fireworks where permitted. [7]",
  "policy_impact": "This bill adds fireworks infractions to the existing adjudication of infractions process for traffic and emergency period infractions. [8] The Office of the Public Defender states that it is the lack of enforcement, not the lack or severity of penalties, that has not deterred persons and businesses from ceasing illegal fireworks activities. [7] The bill establishes various criminal offenses and penalties related to fireworks or articles pyrotechnic. [8]",
  "revenue_sources": "The bill appropriates an unspecified amount from the general revenues of the State of Hawaii. [8] Revenue will be generated through fines; for example, a person who violates subsection (a) of ยง132D-E shall be subject to a $200 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt) fine, while a violation of subsection (b) is subject to a $1,000 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt) fine. [8] [8] In addition to any monetary assessment imposed for a fireworks infraction, the court shall impose an administrative fee of $20 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt) for each fireworks infraction in which judgment is entered in favor of the State, which will be deposited into the judiciary computer system special fund. [8]",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The bill appropriates an unspecified sum from general revenues for fiscal year 2025-2026 and the same sum for fiscal year 2026-2027 to be expended by the judiciary. [8] [8] The legislature finds that creating a fireworks infractions system will allow the judiciary to quickly and efficiently process low-level cases. [8] This is expected to achieve greater efficiency through more effective use of existing resources of the district courts. [8] However, testimony from Phantom Fireworks suggests the creation of a separate fireworks infraction system could be a costly specialty court that may not effectively deter illegal fireworks use. [7] Fines collected for violating this chapter will be split, with eighty per cent paid to the county in which the fine was imposed for law enforcement purposes, and twenty per cent paid to the State. [8] The bill establishes various fines, including a $1,000 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt) fine for a first offense by a carrier, a $2,000 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt) fine for a second offense, and a $5,000 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt) fine for a third or subsequent offense. [8] [8] [8] Permit fees include $25 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt) for firecrackers and $110 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt) for aerial devices. [8] [8] The bill also establishes a fee of $25 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt) for consumer fireworks for cultural uses outside of prescribed periods. [8] The bill also imposes a fine of no less than $500 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt) and no more than $5,000 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt) for violating other provisions of the chapter. [8]",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The measure will generate revenue through various fines and fees. [8] Any person who violates certain consumer fireworks prohibitions shall be subject to a $200 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt) fine or a $1,000 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt) fine. [8] [8] The court will also impose an administrative fee of $20 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt) for each fireworks infraction, which will be deposited into the judiciary computer system special fund. [8]",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The bill appropriates funds to be expended by the judiciary for the purposes of the Act. [8] There is no specific language in the provided documents that details whether these funds are intended for capital expenditures. [8] No specific capital projects or costs are identified in the bill or testimony. [8]",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "Long-term fiscal implications will include the ongoing operational costs for the judiciary to manage the fireworks infractions adjudication system. [8] Revenue from fines and fees is expected to be ongoing, with the court collecting fines and paying eighty per cent to the county in which the fine was imposed and twenty per cent to the State. [8] The long-term fiscal impact will depend on the volume of fireworks infractions and the efficiency of the new adjudication process. [8]",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The previous fiscal note mentioned an appropriation for the Judiciary, which is confirmed in the new bill text, although the specific dollar amount remains blank. [8] The new documents include Standing Committee Report 1268, which details amendments, such as incorporating the fireworks violations adjudication process into the existing traffic and emergency procedure violations process. [9] [9] As recommended by the Attorney General, the committees deleted \"law enforcement officer\" from the definition of \"inspector\". [9] The new documents provide specific dollar amounts for new and amended fines and fees, such as a $200 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt) fine for certain consumer fireworks violations, a $1,000 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt) fine for others, and a $20 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt) administrative fee.
