  "overview": "The purpose and intent of this measure is to establish an adjudication system and procedures to process fireworks infractions. [9] This bill amends multiple definitions and penalties for fireworks offenses, including heightened penalties if another person suffers substantial bodily injury, serious bodily injury, or death as a result of the fireworks offenses. [9] The bill also establishes various criminal offenses and penalties related to fireworks or articles pyrotechnics and adds fireworks infractions to the existing adjudications of infractions process for traffic and emergency period infractions. [8] [8]",
  "appropriations": "There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $ or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2025-2026 and the same sum or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2026-2027 to carry out the purposes of this Act. [8] The sums appropriated shall be expended by the judiciary for the purposes of this Act. [8] The measure also appropriates funds. [9]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "For many years, Hawaiiâ€™s state laws regarding illicit fireworks have made it difficult for state and county agencies to enforce or prosecute these types of cases. [7] Prosecutors have repeatedly cited challenges posed by \"gathering evidence and meeting the high burden of proof necessary for convictions\", as well as \"stringent definitions [in statute, that] . . . routinely create roadblocks to effective prosecution.\" [7] [7] This bill would largely address the concerns raised by prosecutors, and provide greater clarity and efficiency for law enforcement, prosecutors, and the courts that handle these cases. [7]",
  "agency_impact": "The Department of Law Enforcement (DLE) supports House Bill 1483, House Draft 1. [7] This new system will enhance the ability of law enforcement to effectively address fireworks violations that endanger public safety, damage property, and disturb communities. [7] The Department of the Prosecuting Attorney, County of Maui supports this bill because it would help protect our community from the yearly effects of illegal fireworks. [7] The Department of the Attorney General recommends amending the definition of \"inspector\" on page 72, line 8, by deleting the phrase, \"any law enforcement officer or . . . \" [7] [7]",
  "economic_impact": "The widespread use of illegal fireworks poses an extreme danger and lethal risk to public health and safety, resulting in fires, serious burn injuries, and fatalities to innocent bystanders. [8] The cost to the community far outweighs any intrinsic benefit, as numerous lives have been lost over the years from the use of illegal fireworks. [8] [8] With the increase in fireworks-related calls, public safety agencies are heavily strained to maintain adequate response levels for other critical emergencies, which adds to the cost of state and county resources that could be used for natural disasters and other emergencies. [8] [8]",
  "policy_impact": "This bill establishes a comprehensive adjudication system and procedures for processing fireworks infractions in Hawaii, while also amending definitions and enhancing penalties for fireworks offenses. [7] [7] The legislature believes a more robust continuum of enforcement mechanisms must be established to promote compliance with the fireworks control laws, including graduated penalties for repeat or felony level offenses, enhanced penalties for offenses that result in injury or death, and a dedicated adjudication system for fireworks infractions, similar to the existing traffic infraction system. [8] The measure incorporates the fireworks violations adjudication process into the existing traffic and emergency procedure violations adjudication process within the Hawaii Revised Statutes. [9]",
  "revenue_sources": "The bill establishes various fines, including a $200 fine (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt) for violating consumer fireworks prohibitions and a $1,000 fine (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt) for a first offense by a carrier. [8] [8] The court shall also impose an administrative fee of $20 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt) for each fireworks infraction in which judgment is entered in favor of the State. [8] The bill also appropriates funds from the general revenues of the State of Hawaii. [8]",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The purpose of this measure is to establish an adjudication system and procedures to process fireworks infractions. [9] Creating a fireworks infractions system will allow law enforcement agencies and the judiciary to quickly and efficiently process low-level cases. [8] The legislature finds that this chapter will not require expansion of the current traffic division of the district courts, but will achieve greater efficiency through more effective use of existing resources. [8] [8] The Office of the Public Defender warns that a complex adjudication system risks burdening the judicial system with minor infractions, diverting resources from more serious public safety concerns. [7] [7] The bill establishes various penalties, including a $200 fine (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt) for certain consumer fireworks violations and fines for carriers ranging from $1,000 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt) to $5,000 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt). [8] [8] [8] Any person violating any other provision of this chapter shall be fined no less than $500 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt) and no more than $5,000 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt). [8] The bill appropriates an unspecified sum from general revenues for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027 to be expended by the judiciary. [8] [8] Since its establishment, the Illegal Fireworks Task Force has successfully interdicted approximately 200,000 pounds of illegal fireworks from Hawaii's communities. [7] [7] This bill addresses critical weaknesses in the current regulatory framework by establishing a dedicated adjudication system that will streamline the processing of fireworks infractions, allowing for more efficient enforcement and prosecution. [9] [7]",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The court shall collect the fines imposed for violating this chapter and shall pay twenty per cent to the State and eighty per cent to the county in which the fine was imposed. [8] A permit for consumer fireworks commonly known as firecrackers requires payment of a fee of $25 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt), and a permit for aerial devices for display purposes requires a fee of $110 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt). [8] [8] The court shall also impose an administrative fee of $20 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt) for each fireworks infraction, with fees collected to be deposited into the judiciary computer system special fund. [8] [8]",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The legislature finds that this chapter will not require expansion of the current traffic division of the district courts. [8] [8] The bill appropriates an unspecified amount to be expended by the judiciary for the purposes of the Act. [8] No specific capital expenditures are detailed in the provided documents.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The system for processing fireworks infractions is intended to allow judicial, prosecutorial, and law enforcement resources to be used more efficiently and effectively on an ongoing basis. [8] [8] By streamlining the processing of fireworks infractions, this bill may allow for more efficient enforcement and prosecution in the long term. [9] The Office of the Public Defender notes that the creation of a separate fireworks infraction system, a costly specialty court, may not effectively deter illegal fireworks use and could become a recurring expense. [7]",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The new fiscal note is based on a later version of the bill (H.B. No. 1483, S.D. 1) and associated testimony, which provides more specific details than the documents available for the previous note. [9] [9] This version of the bill is set to take effect upon approval, whereas the previous note mentioned a future effective date of July 1, 3000. [8] Unlike the previous note, which stated that documents did not contain specific dollar amounts, the current documents specify numerous fines and fees, such as a $200 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt) fine for certain violations and a $25 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt) permit fee for firecrackers. [8] [8] The current documentation includes detailed testimony from the Department of the Attorney General with specific amendments that have been incorporated into the bill, such as clarifying language for licensed wholesalers and deleting law enforcement officers from the definition of \"inspector\". [9] [9] The new information also highlights the success of the Department of Law Enforcement's Illegal Fireworks Task Force, which has interdicted approximately 200,000 pounds of illegal fireworks. [7] [7] Opposition from the Office of the Public Defender regarding the constitutionality of a \"concurrent trial\" and concerns from industry stakeholders about restrictions on legal consumer fireworks are also detailed in the current documents.
