  "overview": "This measure has been amended to incorporate the new fireworks infraction adjudication process into the existing system used for traffic and emergency procedure violations. The bill also adopts several clarifying amendments regarding the lawful activities of licensed fireworks distributors and permit holders. The purpose remains to create a more efficient enforcement mechanism for fireworks control laws.",
  "appropriations": "",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The methodology for implementing the adjudication system has been significantly revised; instead of creating a new standalone specialty court, the process will be integrated into the existing traffic violations adjudication framework. This change assumes leveraging current infrastructure will be more cost-effective and procedurally streamlined than building a new system. The fiscal impact is now based on expanding an existing judicial process rather than creating a new one.",
  "agency_impact": "The bill now incorporates specific amendments suggested by the Department of the Attorney General, clarifying the legal handling and distribution of fireworks by licensed entities. Additionally, the definition of 'inspector' has been amended to remove law enforcement officers, refining the scope of administrative inspection authority. These changes provide greater operational clarity for both law enforcement and regulated businesses.",
  "economic_impact": "Concerns regarding the creation of a costly new 'specialty court' have been mitigated by the amendment to integrate the adjudication process into the existing traffic court system. Furthermore, amendments have been adopted to clarify legal exemptions for licensed wholesalers and retailers, addressing some of the operational concerns raised by the fireworks industry. The potential for negative impacts on legally permitted commercial displays remains a concern.",
  "policy_impact": "The policy approach has been refined from creating a new, parallel adjudication system to integrating fireworks infractions into the existing framework for traffic violations. This addresses significant constitutional and procedural concerns raised in testimony regarding the complexities of a 'concurrent trial' for civil and criminal matters. This integration represents a more streamlined and legally grounded method of handling non-criminal infractions.",
  "revenue_sources": "",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The projected fiscal implications for the Judiciary are now expected to be lower than initially anticipated for the system's setup and administration. By incorporating the new caseload into the existing traffic adjudication process, the state can leverage current personnel, infrastructure, and procedures, resulting in an expansion of an existing program rather than the more costly creation of a new one. Recurring costs will be associated with the increased caseload within this existing framework.",

  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The most significant update is the amendment to incorporate the fireworks infraction adjudication process into the existing traffic violations system, rather than creating a new standalone court, which addresses cost and constitutional concerns. The bill also adopts specific clarifying language proposed by the Attorney General regarding licensed distributors, permittees, and the definition of 'inspector'. Lastly, the measure's effective date has been changed to upon approval."
