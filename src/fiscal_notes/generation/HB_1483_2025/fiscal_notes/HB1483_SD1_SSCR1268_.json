  "overview": "The purpose and intent of this measure is to establish an adjudication system and procedures to process fireworks infractions and amend multiple definitions and penalties for fireworks offenses. [9] This bill is intended to facilitate more effective enforcement of Hawaii’s fireworks control laws by strengthening and clarifying existing criminal offenses, establishing new offenses, and creating non-criminal fireworks infractions for the lowest-level offenses. [7] [7] It adds fireworks infractions to the existing adjudication of infractions process for traffic and emergency period infractions and establishes heightened penalties for offenses that result in injury or death. [8] [8]",
  "appropriations": "There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii an unspecified sum for fiscal year 2025-2026 and the same sum for fiscal year 2026-2027 to carry out the purposes of this Act. [8] The sums appropriated shall be expended by the judiciary. [8] Appropriating funds is one of the four main purposes of this measure. [9]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The measure is based on the finding that for many years, Hawaii’s state laws regarding illicit fireworks have made it difficult for state and county agencies to enforce or prosecute these types of cases. [7] Prosecutors have repeatedly cited challenges posed by \"gathering evidence and meeting the high burden of proof necessary for convictions\", as well as \"stringent definitions [in statute, that] . . . routinely create roadblocks to effective prosecution.\" [7] [7] The legislature believes a more robust continuum of enforcement mechanisms must be established, including a dedicated adjudication system for fireworks infractions, similar to the existing traffic infraction system. [8]",
  "agency_impact": "The judiciary will expend appropriated funds to establish a new adjudication system for fireworks infractions. [8] [9] The Department of Law Enforcement (DLE) supports the bill, as it establishes various criminal offenses and penalties related to fireworks and articles pyrotechnics, providing a more robust framework for enforcement. [7] [7] The Department of the Attorney General strongly supports the bill and offered comments and suggested amendments to further clarify and correct various aspects of the fireworks control laws. [7] [7]",
  "economic_impact": "The legislature finds that improved enforcement of the fireworks control laws is necessary to protect property from avoidable fire damage and to protect the community from fire- and explosion-related injuries, respiratory distress, and recurring trauma. [8] [8] The bill's graduated penalty structure appropriately reflects the severity of violations, which serves as both a deterrent and an appropriate response to the harm caused. [9] The legislative document specifies new civil fines including a $200 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt) fine for unlawful use of consumer fireworks and a $1,000 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt) fine for unlawful distribution. [8] [8]",
  "policy_impact": "The purpose and intent of this measure is to establish an adjudication system and procedures to process fireworks infractions. [9] It amends multiple definitions and penalties for fireworks offenses and adds fireworks infractions to the existing adjudications of infractions process for traffic and emergency period infractions. [9] [8] This bill will address critical weaknesses in the current regulatory framework by establishing a dedicated adjudication system that will streamline the processing of fireworks infractions, allowing for more efficient enforcement and prosecution. [9]",
  "revenue_sources": "The bill appropriates an unspecified sum out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii. [8] Revenue will also be generated from permit fees, including a fee that the legislative document specifies is $25 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt) for consumer firecrackers and a fee that the legislative document specifies is $110 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt) for aerial devices and display fireworks. [8] [8] The court will also impose an administrative fee that the legislative document specifies is $20 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt) for each fireworks infraction, which will be deposited into the judiciary computer system special fund. [8] [8]",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The legislative document specifies an appropriation of an unspecified sum is made from general revenues for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027 to be expended by the judiciary. [8] [8] This funding is intended to establish a dedicated adjudication system for fireworks infractions. [9] The new system is designed to allow law enforcement agencies and the judiciary to quickly and efficiently process low-level cases. [8] The judiciary will incur ongoing operational costs to manage this new system. [8] The Department of Law Enforcement supports the bill's more robust framework for enforcement, which may require additional resources for state and county police. [7] [7] Conversely, the Office of the Public Defender opposes the measure, citing concerns about creating \"new and likely unconstitutional court processes\" that could become a \"procedural nightmare\". [7] [7] Testimony also raises the concern of creating a \"costly specialty court\". [7] New revenue will be generated from fines; the legislative document specifies a fine of $200 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt) for certain violations and a fine of $1,000 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt) for others. [8] [8] The legislative document also specifies a new administrative fee of $20 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt) for each infraction will support the judiciary computer system special fund. [8] [8]",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The measure will generate revenue for the State and counties through a schedule of monetary assessments for fireworks infractions. [8] [8] The legislative document specifies new civil fines, including a $200 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt) fine for the unlawful purchase or use of consumer fireworks. [8] In addition, the legislative document specifies the court shall impose an administrative fee of $20 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt) for each fireworks infraction in which judgment is entered in favor of the State, with the fees deposited into the judiciary computer system special fund. [8] [8]",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The bill appropriates funds to be expended by the judiciary to carry out the purposes of the Act, which includes establishing a new adjudication system. [8] [9] These funds may be used for necessary investments in court technology or other infrastructure to implement the new process for handling fireworks infractions. [8] Revenue from a new administrative fee that the legislative document specifies is $20 (HB1483_SD1_.HTM.txt) will be deposited into the judiciary computer system special fund and can be used for technology-related expenditures. [8] [8]",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The dedicated adjudication system for fireworks infractions will represent a permanent, ongoing operational cost for the judiciary. [8] The enforcement of amended definitions, heightened penalties, and new criminal offenses by state and county law enforcement agencies will be a recurring expense. [7] [7] The system of fines and fees established by the bill is expected to generate revenue on a continuing basis, which may offset some of the adjudication and enforcement costs. [8]",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "This fiscal note reflects a significant change, as the current bill is set to take effect upon approval, whereas the previous fiscal note's analysis was based on a deferred effective date that negated any fiscal impact. [8] [9] The previous conclusion of no appropriations, revenues, or expenditures is now invalid; this bill carries immediate fiscal implications for the judiciary through a direct appropriation from general revenues. [8] [8] New testimony from the Office of the Public Defender raises specific constitutional and procedural objections to the proposed \"concurrent trial\" system, which were not previously considered. [7] [7] Furthermore, this update incorporates amendments made by Senate committees, including clarifications for licensed distributors and removing \"law enforcement officer\" from the definition of \"inspector,\" reflecting new testimony and committee actions.
