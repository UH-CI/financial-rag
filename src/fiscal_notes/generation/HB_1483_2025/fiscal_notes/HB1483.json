  "overview": "This measure aims to improve the enforcement of fireworks laws by establishing a new adjudication system for fireworks infractions and amending various definitions and penalties. It creates new criminal offenses for fireworks-related violations and enhances penalties under specific circumstances to address enforcement challenges. The bill also appropriates unspecified funds to support these changes.",
  "appropriations": "The measure appropriates an unspecified amount of funds to implement its provisions. The provided text does not detail the specific fiscal years, amounts, or intended uses for the appropriation. Further details on how the funds will be allocated for staffing, training, or other operational needs are not included in the document.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The provided legislative document does not contain information regarding the assumptions, cost estimation methods, or data sources used for any financial projections. It is a committee report focused on the purpose and amendments to the bill rather than a detailed fiscal analysis. Therefore, there is no methodology to report for calculating financial impacts.",
  "agency_impact": "The measure is expected to have a significant operational impact on law enforcement agencies, prosecutors, and the courts by providing greater clarity and efficiency in enforcing fireworks laws. The Honolulu Police Department, Department of Law Enforcement, and the Department of the Attorney General provided testimony in support, indicating their involvement. The bill also restores the authority of law enforcement officers to conduct inspections to verify compliance with fireworks laws.",
  "economic_impact": "The provided document does not specify any direct economic impacts, such as cost savings or financial benefits to the community. The focus of the measure is on improving the legal and enforcement framework for fireworks control. Information on potential reductions in related expenditures, such as for emergency services, is not included.",
  "policy_impact": "This measure significantly modifies state policy by creating a new civil adjudication process for fireworks infractions, which is a departure from previous enforcement mechanisms. It amends existing statutes by changing definitions and creating new, stricter criminal offenses and penalties for illegal fireworks. The bill addresses long-standing difficulties in prosecuting fireworks cases, aiming to strengthen the state's overall enforcement strategy.",
  "revenue_sources": "The bill includes an appropriation of funds, but the specific revenue source for this appropriation is not identified in the document. It is not stated whether the funding will come from the general fund, a special fund, or another revenue stream. The measure also establishes new penalties, which may generate revenue through fines, but this is not identified as a primary funding source.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The provided document does not contain a six-year fiscal outlook for this measure. There are no projections regarding future costs, staffing changes, or recurring expenses associated with the new adjudication system or enhanced enforcement. The bill's purpose clause mentions an appropriation, but no multi-year financial details or assumptions about program expansion are provided. Consequently, the long-term fiscal implications cannot be determined from the text.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The measure may increase state or county operating revenue through the collection of fines from the newly established fireworks infractions and penalties. However, the document does not provide any estimates or projections for the potential revenue that could be generated. The impact on operating revenues is therefore uncertain and not quantified in the text.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "There is no mention of any capital expenditures required to implement this measure. The document does not indicate a need for investments in new facilities, major equipment, or technology infrastructure. The focus is on legal and procedural changes rather than capital projects.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The document provides no information on the fiscal implications of this measure beyond a six-year period. Ongoing fiscal obligations, such as annual operating costs for the adjudication system or sustained enforcement efforts, are not detailed. The long-term sustainability of the program and its funding are not addressed.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "No previous fiscal note was provided in the context, so a comparison cannot be made. This section is not applicable."
