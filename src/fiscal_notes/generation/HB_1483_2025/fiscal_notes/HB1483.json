  "overview": "This measure aims to improve the enforcement of fireworks laws by establishing a new adjudication system for fireworks infractions. It amends definitions and penalties for fireworks offenses, introduces heightened penalties for certain circumstances, and creates new criminal offenses related to pyrotechnics. The bill also appropriates funds to support these changes.",
  "appropriations": "The measure appropriates an unspecified amount of funds to implement its provisions. The provided document does not detail the specific fiscal years, the total amount of the appropriation, or how the funds will be allocated. Information regarding specific uses such as staffing, training, or technology is not included.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The provided legislative document does not contain information on the assumptions, cost estimation methods, or data sources used for any financial projections. There are no references to comparable programs or historical data to support the fiscal impact. Therefore, the methodology for calculating the financial impact is not described.",
  "agency_impact": "This measure is expected to impact the Department of Law Enforcement, the Department of the Attorney General, and county police departments by providing greater clarity and efficiency in enforcing fireworks laws. It restores the authority of law enforcement officers to conduct inspections, which is intended to streamline processes for law enforcement, prosecutors, and the courts. The changes aim to address current challenges in gathering evidence and meeting the burden of proof for convictions.",
  "economic_impact": "The provided document does not detail the expected economic effects of the measure. Information regarding potential cost savings from improved enforcement, reductions in expenditures related to illegal fireworks incidents, or specific economic benefits to the community is not included. The text focuses primarily on legal and procedural amendments.",
  "policy_impact": "This measure significantly modifies state policy on fireworks by creating a new civil adjudication system for infractions, which would operate alongside criminal prosecution. It amends existing laws by clarifying key definitions such as 'aerial device' and 'consumer fireworks' and by establishing new weight thresholds for penalties. The bill's purpose is to overcome existing legal challenges in prosecuting illegal fireworks cases, thereby strengthening the state's enforcement capabilities.",
  "revenue_sources": "The bill indicates that funds will be appropriated to support its implementation, but it does not identify the specific revenue source. It is not specified whether the funding will be drawn from the general fund, special funds, grants, or new fees. The source of revenue to support this measure remains undetermined from the provided text.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The provided document does not contain a six-year fiscal outlook for this measure. While it appropriates an unspecified amount of funds, there are no projections for future costs, staffing changes, or recurring expenses. The text does not offer workload data or assumptions about program expansion that would be necessary to estimate long-term fiscal implications. The financial impact is indeterminate as the bill does not specify the amount of the appropriation or any associated costs for personnel, equipment, or other operating expenses. The establishment of a new adjudication system will likely have ongoing costs, but these are not quantified in the report. Additionally, no details are provided on potential revenue from fines or penalties that might offset these expenses. The long-term financial commitment required to sustain these changes is not outlined in the document.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The provided legislative report does not describe any anticipated impacts on the state's operating revenues.

There is no information to suggest any other changes to existing state revenue streams.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "There is no mention of capital expenditures in the provided document. The measure, as described, does not appear to require investments in new facilities, major equipment, or significant technology infrastructure. Therefore, no impact on capital expenditures is anticipated based on the text provided.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The document does not project fiscal implications beyond the initial implementation period. Ongoing fiscal obligations, such as the annual operating costs for the new adjudication system or sustained enforcement efforts, are not quantified. The long-term sustainability and funding mechanisms for the measure's provisions after the first six years are not addressed.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "No previous fiscal note was provided in the context documents. Therefore, a comparison cannot be made and there are no updates to report."
