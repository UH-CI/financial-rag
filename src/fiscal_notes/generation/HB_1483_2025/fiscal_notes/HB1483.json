  "overview": "The purpose of this measure is to establish an adjudication system and procedures to process fireworks infractions, amend and establish various definitions and penalties for fireworks offenses, and establish various criminal offenses and penalties related to fireworks or articles pyrotechnics. The measure also seeks to appropriate funds. Your Committee finds that it has been difficult for state and county agencies to enforce or prosecute illegal fireworks cases in the State due to challenges with gathering evidence, meeting the high burden of proof necessary for convictions, and stringent definitions.",
  "appropriations": "The purpose of this measure includes to \"Appropriate funds\" (HB1483). However, the provided legislative documents do not specify the amounts or intended uses of these appropriations. No specific budgetary data for staffing, training, contracts, or technology is included in the text.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The financial projections are based on the penalty and fine structure outlined in the legislative text. The methodology involves identifying the various monetary assessments and fines for specific offenses. These include a $1,000 (HB1483_.HTM.txt) fine for a first offense, a $2,000 (HB1483_.HTM.txt) fine for a second offense, and up to a $5,000 (HB1483_.HTM.txt) fine for subsequent offenses, but no data on the projected number of violations is provided.",
  "agency_impact": "This measure would \"provide greater clarity and efficiency for law enforcement, prosecutors, and the courts\" (HB1483). The Department of Law Enforcement, Department of the Attorney General, and Honolulu Police Department provided testimony in support of this measure. The bill also restores \"the authority of law enforcement officers to conduct inspections to verify compliance with fireworks laws\" (HB1483), indicating an operational impact on these agencies.",
  "economic_impact": "The measure is expected to generate revenue through a new penalty structure. For certain carrier violations, a first offense is subject to a $1,000 (HB1483_.HTM.txt) fine, a second offense is subject to a $2,000 (HB1483_.HTM.txt) fine, and a third or subsequent offense is subject to a $5,000 (HB1483_.HTM.txt) fine. Other violations of the chapter shall be fined no less than $500 (HB1483_.HTM.txt) and no more than $5,000 (HB1483_.HTM.txt) for each violation.",
  "policy_impact": "This measure amends and establishes \"various definitions and penalties for fireworks offenses, including establishing heightened penalties under certain circumstances\" (HB1483). It modifies existing law by clarifying the definitions of \"aerial device\", \"consumer fireworks\", and \"fireworks\", and restores the authority of law enforcement officers to conduct inspections. The bill also changes \"the effective date to July 1, 3000, to encourage further discussion\" (HB1483).",
  "revenue_sources": "Revenue for this measure will be generated from fines and assessments for fireworks infractions. Sources include a $1,000 (HB1483_.HTM.txt) fine for a first offense by a carrier, a $2,000 (HB1483_.HTM.txt) fine for a second offense, and a $5,000 (HB1483_.HTM.txt) fine for a third offense. Other violations are subject to a fine of no less than $500 (HB1483_.HTM.txt) and no more than $5,000 (HB1483_.HTM.txt).",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The six-year fiscal outlook is uncertain as the measure's effective date has been changed to \"July 1, 3000, to encourage further discussion\" (HB1483). Should the measure be enacted with an earlier effective date, it would establish a new adjudication system with recurring costs and revenues. Potential revenue would be generated from a tiered fine system for carriers, including a $1,000 (HB1483_.HTM.txt) fine for a first offense, a $2,000 (HB1483_.HTM.txt) fine for a second offense committed within five years, and a $5,000 (HB1483_.HTM.txt) fine for a third or subsequent offense committed within five years. The legislative document also specifies other penalties, such as a $20.00 (HB1483_.HTM.txt) assessment for failure to pay a monetary assessment on time. Other offenses carry fines such as $200.00 (HB1483_.HTM.txt), $300.00 (HB1483_.HTM.txt), and up to $1,000 (HB1483_.HTM.txt) or $2,000 (HB1483_.HTM.txt) for other specific violations. Any person violating any other provision of the chapter shall be fined no less than $500 (HB1483_.HTM.txt) and no more than $5,000 (HB1483_.HTM.txt) for each violation. The long-term fiscal impact depends entirely on future amendments to the effective date and the subsequent volume of enforcement actions.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The measure is expected to increase operating revenue through the establishment of new fines and penalties for fireworks infractions. Potential new revenue streams include a $1,000 (HB1483_.HTM.txt) fine for a first offense, a $2,000 (HB1483_.HTM.txt) fine for a second offense, and a $5,000 (HB1483_.HTM.txt) fine for a third or subsequent offense. The overall impact on operating revenue is indeterminate and depends on the frequency of violations and the effectiveness of enforcement.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The provided documents do not identify any capital expenditures related to this measure. There is no mention of investments in new facilities, equipment, or technology infrastructure. Therefore, no capital expenditure impact is anticipated based on the available information.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "Given the bill's effective date of \"July 1, 3000\" (HB1483), there are no fiscal implications anticipated after six years or in the foreseeable future. The change was made \"to encourage further discussion\" (HB1483), indicating that any ongoing fiscal obligations are contingent on future legislative action. If enacted, the established adjudication system and penalty structure would create ongoing operating costs and revenue streams.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "No previous fiscal note was provided in the context, so this section is not applicable."
