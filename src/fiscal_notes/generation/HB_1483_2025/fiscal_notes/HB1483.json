  "overview": "This measure aims to improve the enforcement of fireworks laws by establishing a new adjudication system and procedures for fireworks infractions. It amends various definitions and penalties for fireworks offenses, establishes heightened penalties under certain circumstances, and creates new criminal offenses related to pyrotechnics. The bill also appropriates unspecified funds to support these new enforcement mechanisms.",
  "appropriations": "The bill includes a provision to appropriate funds to implement its mandates. However, the provided committee report does not specify the amount of funding, the fiscal years for which the appropriation is intended, or the specific uses of the funds. Details regarding allocations for staffing, training, technology, or other operational costs are not mentioned in the document.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The provided legislative document does not contain any financial projections, cost estimations, or the assumptions and methodology used to determine the fiscal impact of the measure. There are no references to data sources or comparisons to other programs used for financial calculations. The bill's effective date was deferred to July 1, 3000, to encourage further discussion, indicating that fiscal details are yet to be determined.",
  "agency_impact": "This measure is expected to impact law enforcement, prosecutors, and the courts by providing greater clarity and efficiency in handling illegal fireworks cases. The bill restores the authority of law enforcement officers to conduct inspections, directly affecting the operational procedures of state and county police departments. The Department of the Attorney General and the judiciary will also be impacted by the new adjudication system and amended penalty structures.",
  "economic_impact": "The provided document does not specify any direct economic impacts resulting from this measure. There is no information regarding potential cost savings for the state or counties, reductions in expenditures related to fire damage or injuries, or other economic benefits to the community. The focus of the report is on legal and enforcement frameworks rather than economic outcomes.",
  "policy_impact": "This measure significantly alters state policy on fireworks by creating a new civil adjudication system for infractions, which serves as an alternative to criminal prosecution. It amends existing laws by modifying definitions for fireworks, adjusting weight thresholds for penalties, and establishing new criminal offenses. The bill also changes enforcement policy by explicitly restoring the authority of law enforcement officers to conduct inspections for compliance with fireworks laws.",
  "revenue_sources": "While the measure indicates that funds will be appropriated, the specific source of revenue is not identified in the committee report. The document does not specify whether the funding will be derived from the general fund, special funds, grants, or new fees collected through the adjudication process. The mechanism for funding the new enforcement and adjudication activities is not detailed.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The committee report provides no information regarding the six-year fiscal implications of this bill. There are no projections for future costs, required staffing changes, recurring operational expenses, or other budgetary needs over this period. The lack of financial data is consistent with the committee's decision to change the bill's effective date to July 1, 3000, to allow for further discussion on its implementation and financial requirements. Consequently, it is not possible to determine the measure's fiscal impact over the next six years based on the provided text. No multi-year cost estimates are available in the document. The long-term financial outlook is not addressed. Assumptions about program expansion or permanence cannot be made. The document does not provide a basis for a six-year fiscal forecast. Staffing needs are not projected. Recurring expenses are not detailed.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The provided document does not describe any anticipated impacts on state or county operating revenues. It does not mention the creation of new fines, fees, or other revenue streams that might result from the new adjudication system for fireworks infractions. Therefore, any potential changes to operating revenues are undetermined based on the information available.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "There is no mention of any required capital expenditures in the provided committee report. The document does not identify a need for investments in facilities, major equipment, or technology infrastructure to support the proposed changes. Any potential capital costs associated with the measure are not outlined.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The document does not address the fiscal implications of this measure beyond a six-year period. There is no information regarding ongoing annual operating costs, the sustainability of funding, or other long-term financial obligations. The bill's deferred effective date suggests that these long-term fiscal considerations have not yet been determined.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "No previous fiscal note was provided in the context, so a comparison cannot be made."
