[1] The funds are to carry out the purposes of this Act, including to update the judiciary information management system to implement the adjudications process established by section 2 of this Act. [1] The sums appropriated shall be expended by the judiciary for the purposes of this Act. [1]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The provided legislative documents do not specify the assumptions or methodology used for fiscal projections. [1] The fiscal impact is based on the creation of a new adjudication system, an appropriation of an unspecified amount for the judiciary, and the establishment of new fines and fees for violations. [1] The revenue generated would depend on the number of infractions processed, for which no estimate is provided in the bill. [1]",
  "agency_impact": "This bill establishes a dedicated adjudication system for fireworks infractions, which will impact the judiciary by requiring it to process these cases. [1] The judiciary's information management system will need to be updated to implement the new adjudications process. [1] Law enforcement agencies will be responsible for issuing notices of infraction, and county fire department officers will act as inspectors with authority to enter and inspect premises. [1] [1]",
  "economic_impact": "The legislature finds that the widespread use of illegal fireworks poses an extreme danger and lethal risk to public health and safety, resulting in fires, serious burn injuries, and fatalities. [1] This measure is intended to reduce the societal costs associated with illegal fireworks by improving enforcement. [1] The bill also generates revenue through new fines and fees, such as a $20 (HB1483_.HTM.txt) administrative fee for each infraction [1], a $25 (HB1483_.HTM.txt) permit fee for firecrackers [1], and fines ranging from $500 (HB1483_.HTM.txt) to $5,000 (HB1483_.HTM.txt) for certain violations. [1]",
  "policy_impact": "This Act establishes a new chapter in the Hawaii Revised Statutes to create a dedicated adjudication system for fireworks infractions, similar to the existing traffic infraction system.

[1] It also confers concurrent jurisdiction on district courts to hear and dispose of cases of fireworks infractions by children. [1]",
  "revenue_sources": "Revenue to support the bill's provisions will be generated from monetary assessments, fees, and fines. [1] A permit for consumer fireworks known as firecrackers requires a fee of $25 (HB1483_.HTM.txt), while a permit for aerial devices requires a fee of $110 (HB1483_.HTM.txt). [1] [1] The court shall impose an administrative fee of $20 (HB1483_.HTM.txt) for each fireworks infraction, which is deposited into the judiciary computer system special fund, and fines collected are split with eighty per cent to the county and twenty per cent to the State. [1] [1]",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The bill appropriates an unspecified sum for fiscal year 2025-2026 and fiscal year 2026-2027 to update the judiciary information management system. [1] This is expected to be an initial cost, with potential for recurring maintenance expenses. [1] The new adjudication system for fireworks infractions will create ongoing operational costs for the judiciary and law enforcement agencies. [1] The bill establishes new recurring revenue streams from various fees and fines. [1] These include a $25 (HB1483_.HTM.txt) permit fee for firecrackers and a $110 (HB1483_.HTM.txt) fee for aerial devices. [1] [1] Fines for violations range from $200 (HB1483_.HTM.txt) for illegal use of consumer fireworks to $5,000 (HB1483_.HTM.txt) for repeat carrier offenses. [1] [1] The court will also impose a $20 (HB1483_.HTM.txt) administrative fee for each fireworks infraction where judgment is entered for the State. [1] Of the fines collected, eighty per cent shall be paid to the county and twenty per cent to the State. [1] The precise fiscal impact over six years is indeterminate as it depends on the number of violations that will be cited and adjudicated, for which the provided documents offer no estimate. [1] This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2025, meaning the fiscal implications begin in FY 2026. [1]",

[1] The provided text does not specify any other capital expenditures for facilities or equipment. [1]",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "After the initial six-year period, the adjudication system for fireworks infractions will represent an ongoing operational cost for the judiciary. [1] Revenue from the established fines and fees is expected to be recurring, providing a continuous source of funds for the State and counties.
