  "overview": "This measure facilitates more effective enforcement of fireworks laws through a multi-pronged approach. It amends definitions to rely on common-sense standards to ease prosecution, strengthens and clarifies existing criminal offenses, and establishes new offenses for activities like sending fireworks via air delivery. The bill also introduces a tiered penalty structure with heightened penalties for repeat offenders and offenses causing substantial bodily injury or death, while establishing non-criminal infractions for lower-level violations to improve accountability.",
  "appropriations": "The bill includes a monetary appropriation in an amount yet to be determined to support its implementation. This funding is intended to assist county police departments in carrying out the purposes of the measure. The specific allocation and fiscal years are not defined in the current version.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal analysis now incorporates the assumption that amending definitions to common-sense standards will reduce prosecutorial costs by lessening the need for expert testimony and physical evidence. Furthermore, the methodology for enforcement assumes that establishing non-criminal infractions, similar to traffic citations, will allow law enforcement to process a higher volume of violations efficiently with existing resources. This is expected to increase overall accountability for illicit fireworks use.",
  "agency_impact": "The creation of a non-criminal infraction system is intended to improve the efficiency of law enforcement by allowing officers to issue citations quickly and move on, maximizing the use of limited resources during peak periods. However, the Department of the Attorney General has raised a new administrative concern regarding the placement of fireworks infractions within the statutory chapter related to motor vehicles. The Department recommends creating a new, separate chapter in the Hawaii Revised Statutes to house the adjudication process for these non-traffic infractions.",
  "economic_impact": "New testimony has identified potential negative economic impacts on the licensed professional fireworks display industry. The proposed prohibition on sending or receiving articles pyrotechnic by air delivery could disrupt the supply chain for theatrical effects used in concerts and productions. Additionally, a proposed limit of fifty permits per person annually is viewed as seriously detrimental to commercial display companies that produce over one hundred permitted shows per year.",
  "policy_impact": "This measure represents a significant policy shift by creating a detailed, tiered penalty structure for fireworks offenses based on weight, repeat offenses, and the level of harm caused. It introduces strict liability for certain elements of an offense to lower the burden of proof for prosecutors. The establishment of a non-criminal infraction system for low-level violations introduces a new enforcement model for fireworks control, prioritizing broad accountability over intensive criminal prosecution for minor offenses.",
  "revenue_sources": "The measure will create a new revenue stream through the establishment of non-criminal fireworks infractions. The bill specifies fines for these infractions, such as a $300 fine for possessing or setting off less than five pounds of illicit aerial devices and a $200 fine for certain consumer fireworks prohibitions. The source of the initial appropriation to implement the bill has not been specified but is presumed to be general funds.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The six-year outlook involves new costs for county police departments to support enhanced enforcement activities, which is acknowledged by the inclusion of an appropriation in the bill. The Judiciary is expected to incur costs related to processing an increased volume of both criminal cases and non-criminal infractions. While integrating the infraction system into the existing traffic adjudication framework mitigates the need for new infrastructure, sustained funding will be required for the increased caseload. These costs will be partially offset by revenue generated from the new fines established for infractions, though the net fiscal impact over the six-year period remains undetermined.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The bill is anticipated to have a positive impact on operating revenues. The establishment of a new category of non-criminal fireworks infractions, with specified fines ranging from $200 to $300, will generate a new stream of revenue for the State. The total amount of this new revenue will be dependent on the level of enforcement and the number of citations issued and paid.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "After the initial six-year period, the fiscal implications are expected to be ongoing annual operating costs for enforcement and adjudication. The program is permanent, so county police departments and the Judiciary will require sustained funding to manage the caseload. Revenue from fines is also expected to be recurring, contributing to the long-term fiscal landscape of the program.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "Key updates include the addition of an unspecified monetary appropriation to fund the bill's purposes, which was noted with support by county police. New testimony has identified specific negative economic impacts on the professional pyrotechnics industry related to proposed air delivery prohibitions and permit caps. The bill's detailed, tiered penalty structure, including heightened penalties for offenses causing injury or death, is a significant new element, as is the creation of a new revenue stream from specified fines for non-criminal infractions. Finally, the Attorney General has raised a new statutory organization concern, recommending that fireworks infractions be placed in a new chapter of the law rather than within the motor vehicle code."
