  "overview": "The purpose and intent of this measure is to strengthen state fireworks laws. [11] Specifically, the measure amends various definitions relating to fireworks, increases certain penalties, establishes various criminal offenses, establishes processes for the adjudication of fireworks infractions, and appropriates moneys. [11] The purpose of this bill is to facilitate more effective enforcement of Hawaii’s fireworks control laws by amending definitions, strengthening criminal offenses, establishing new offenses, establishing heightened penalties, and establishing non-criminal fireworks infractions for the lowest-level offenses. [10] [10] [10]",
  "appropriations": "The measure appropriates moneys. [11] The Hawaii County Police Department (HPD) is also grateful to see that the Bill includes monetary appropriation, in amounts yet to be determined, to carry out the purposes of the Bill. [10] The bill also appropriates funds. [10]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The bill’s proposed amendments to definitions for fireworks present a straightforward, common-sense standard that could be established through laypeople’s observations and testimony, in many cases, without requiring the presentation of any physical evidence or expert witnesses. [10] For nearly all of the enhanced penalties, the offender would be held strictly liable with respect to any knowledge that the illicit fireworks would cause such injuries or death. [10] Due to the lower standard of proof for fireworks infractions, these citations could be issued very quickly and easily, without requiring any further investigation. [10]",
  "agency_impact": "This bill addresses concerns raised by prosecutors and provides clarity and efficiency for law enforcement, prosecutors, and courts that handle these cases. [10] The Department of the Attorney General, Honolulu Police Department, Hawaii County Police Department, and the Department of the Prosecuting Attorney for the County of Maui all strongly support this bill. [10] [10] [10] [10] The bill would help protect the community from the yearly effects of illegal fireworks, such as fire- and explosion-related property damage and injuries. [10]",
  "economic_impact": "Better enforcement of the fireworks control laws is essential not only to safeguard property from preventable fire damage but also to protect the community from injuries related to fires and explosions, respiratory issues caused by air pollution, and ongoing trauma experienced by individuals due to loud explosions. [10] Unauthorized fireworks place a heavy burden on emergency responders, diverting resources away from critical situations. [10] This measure aims to increase enforcement against fireworks infractions by creating a new system of adjudication and new penalties to address the current failures of our legal system. [10]",
  "policy_impact": "This bill separates out the various acts based on the level of dangerousness and places them under standalone offenses. [10] It establishes non-criminal fireworks infractions for the lowest-level offenses. [10] It also establishes heightened penalties for repeat offenders and fireworks offenses that result in substantial bodily injury, serious bodily injury, or death. [10]",
  "revenue_sources": "The measure increases certain penalties for fireworks offenses. [11] Penalties for standalone offenses range from an infraction carrying only a $200 (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt) fine, to class C felonies facing up to a $10,000 (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt) fine. [10] The bill also establishes a $300 (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt) fine for purchasing, possessing, or setting off less than five pounds of illicit aerial devices, display fireworks, or articles pyrotechnic. [10]",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The bill establishes non-criminal penalties for fireworks infractions for purchasing, possessing, or setting off small amounts of illicit aerial devices. [10] Penalties for standalone offenses range from an infraction carrying a $200 (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt) fine to class C felonies facing up to a $10,000 (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt) fine and/or up to five years imprisonment. [10] The bill establishes a $300 (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt) fine for possessing less than five pounds of illicit aerial devices. [10] The bill also establishes heightened penalties under certain circumstances. [10] The offense of distributing aerial devices without a permit would normally be a class C felony with a fine up to $10,000 (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt), but it becomes a class B felony with up to a $25,000 (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt) fine if the offender had a prior conviction or if the fireworks caused substantial bodily injury. [10] [10] It becomes a class A felony with up to a $50,000 (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt) fine if it caused serious bodily injury or death. [10] For possessing controlled fireworks without a permit, the level of offense is based on weight, with fifty pounds or more being a class B felony. [10] The adjudications process for infractions would be controlled by chapter 291D, HRS. [10] The Department of the Attorney General believes this would allow law enforcement and courts to hold a much higher number of individuals accountable quickly and safely and thus make more efficient use of limited resources. [10]",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The measure increases certain penalties for fireworks offenses, which will generate revenue. [11] The bill establishes a $300 (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt) fine for purchasing, possessing, or setting off small amounts of illicit fireworks. [10] Penalties for other standalone offenses range from an infraction carrying a $200 (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt) fine to a class C felony with a fine up to $10,000 (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt), and enhanced penalties can increase fines to $25,000 (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt) or $50,000 (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt). [10] [10] [10]",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The measure appropriates moneys. [11] The bill includes a monetary appropriation, in amounts yet to be determined, to carry out its purposes. [10] There is no specific language in the provided documents that details whether these funds are intended for capital expenditures. [10]",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The bill is expected to make more efficient use of limited resources at certain critical times of the year for law enforcement agencies and courts. [10] The changes are intended to provide an \"effective deterrent\" to the distribution and use of illicit fireworks, which could lead to long-term savings in public safety resources. [10] The long-term fiscal impact will depend on the effectiveness of the new penalty structure and the volume of infractions cited. [10]",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "While the previous fiscal note mentioned an unspecified appropriation, new testimony from the Hawaii County Police Department confirms gratitude for a monetary appropriation, though the amount remains undetermined. [10] The prior note mentioned incorporating fireworks infractions into the traffic infraction process under chapter 291D, which is supported by new testimony from the Department of the Attorney General. [10] The new documents elaborate on the updated penalty structure, clarifying that penalties range from a $200 (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt) infraction fine up to a $50,000 (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt) fine for a class A felony if illicit fireworks cause serious bodily injury or death. [10] [10] Testimony from the Attorney General further details how amended definitions and strict liability standards are designed to address previous roadblocks to effective prosecution. [10] [10]"
