  "overview": "The purpose and intent of this measure is to strengthen state fireworks laws. [10] Specifically, the measure amends various definitions relating to fireworks, increases certain penalties for fireworks offenses, establishes various criminal offenses and penalties, establishes processes relating to the adjudication of fireworks infractions, and appropriates moneys. [10] Your Committee believes that this measure appropriately addresses shortcomings in the current regulatory framework and establishes a sensible penalty structure. [10]",
  "appropriations": "The measure appropriates moneys. [10] <previous section>The previous fiscal note specified an appropriation of an unspecified sum for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027 to be expended by the judiciary, but the current committee report does not contain these details.</previous section>",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The Committee recognizes the need to reform the State's approach to enforcing fireworks laws. [10] This measure is assumed to appropriately address shortcomings in the current regulatory framework. [10] It also establishes a sensible penalty structure that imposes just consequences based on the severity of violations. [10]",
  "agency_impact": "Your Committee received written comments in support of this measure from the Department of the Attorney General, Honolulu Police Department, Hawaii County Police Department, and the Department of the Prosecuting Attorney, County of Maui. [10] The Hawaiian Humane Society and four individuals also submitted supportive comments. [10] Written comments in opposition to this measure were received from Hawaii Explosives and Pyrotechnics and one individual. [10]",
  "economic_impact": "The measure increases certain penalties for fireworks offenses. [10] It also establishes a sensible penalty structure that imposes just consequences based on the severity of violations. [10] <previous section>The previous fiscal note cited specific civil fines based on the bill text, but these amounts are not detailed in the current committee report.</previous section>",
  "policy_impact": "The purpose and intent of this measure is to strengthen state fireworks laws by amending various definitions, increasing penalties, and establishing new criminal offenses. [10] The measure establishes processes relating to the adjudication of fireworks infractions. [10] Your Committee believes that this measure appropriately addresses shortcomings in the current regulatory framework. [10]",
  "revenue_sources": "The measure appropriates moneys, but the source of these funds is not specified in the committee report. [10] <previous section>The previous fiscal note identified general revenues as the funding source and also detailed revenue generation from various permit and administrative fees, but these specifics are absent from the current committee report.</previous section>",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "<previous section>The current committee report does not provide details on the six-year fiscal implications. [10] The previous fiscal note projected ongoing operational costs for the judiciary to manage a new adjudication system and for law enforcement agencies to enforce new offenses. [10] It also anticipated recurring revenue from new fines and fees, which are not detailed in the report from the Committee on Ways and Means. [10]</previous section>",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "<previous section>The current committee report does not detail any impacts on operating revenue. [10] The previous fiscal note indicated that the measure would generate revenue through a schedule of monetary assessments and administrative fees, but these are not specified in this report. [10]</previous section>",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "<previous section>No capital expenditures are identified in the current committee report. [10] The previous fiscal note suggested that appropriated funds for the judiciary could be used for investments in court technology to implement the new adjudication process for fireworks infractions. [10]</previous section>",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "<previous section>The current committee report does not address long-term fiscal implications. [10] The previous fiscal note anticipated that the dedicated adjudication system and enhanced enforcement would represent permanent, ongoing operational costs for the judiciary and law enforcement. [10] These costs would be partially offset by recurring revenue from the bill's system of fines and fees. [10]</previous section>",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "This fiscal note is based on the report from the Committee on Ways and Means, which confirms the measure's intent but lacks the specific financial details present in the previous fiscal note. [10] While the previous note cited specific fine and fee amounts from the bill text, this report only broadly states that the measure increases penalties and appropriates moneys. [10] Consequently, sections related to appropriations, economic impact, revenue, and long-term fiscal implications now reference the more detailed, prior analysis, as the current source document does not provide this information.
