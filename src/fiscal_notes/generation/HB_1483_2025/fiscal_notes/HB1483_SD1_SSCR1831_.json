  "overview": "The purpose of this bill is to facilitate more effective enforcement of Hawaii’s fireworks control laws by amending definitions, strengthening and clarifying existing criminal fireworks offenses, establishing new fireworks offenses, establishing heightened penalties, and establishing non-criminal fireworks infractions for the lowest-level offenses. [10] This bill addresses concerns raised by prosecutors and provides clarity and efficiency for law enforcement, prosecutors, and courts that handle these cases. [10] Specifically, the measure amends various definitions, increases penalties, establishes criminal offenses, establishes processes for adjudicating infractions, and appropriates moneys. [11]",
  "appropriations": "The measure appropriates moneys. [11] The Hawaii County Police Department testimony noted that the Bill includes monetary appropriation, in amounts yet to be determined, to carry out the purposes of the Bill. [10]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The bill's proposed amendments to definitions present a straightforward, common-sense standard that could arguably be established through laypeople’s observations and testimony without requiring physical evidence or expert witnesses. [10] The bill separates out the various acts based on the level of dangerousness and places them under standalone offenses. [10] Penalties for these standalone offenses range from an infraction carrying only a $200 (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt) fine, to class C felonies facing up to a $10,000 (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt) fine and/or up to five years imprisonment. [10]",
  "agency_impact": "Similar to the way non-criminal traffic citations are issued now, a law enforcement officer could issue multiple fireworks citations without having to spend additional time interviewing witnesses, collecting evidence, or writing police reports. [10] Due to the lower standard of proof for fireworks infractions, these citations could be issued very quickly and easily, without requiring any further investigation, allowing the officer to continue patrolling the community or addressing other calls. [10] The Department of the Attorney General recommends adding a new chapter to Title 38 of the HRS to address the notices of infraction and adjudications process for all fireworks infractions. [10]",
  "economic_impact": "Penalties for standalone offenses range from an infraction carrying a $200 (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt) fine to class C felonies facing up to a $10,000 (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt) fine. [10] The offense of distributing aerial devices without a permit becomes a class B felony with up to a $25,000 (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt) fine if the offender had a prior conviction or caused substantial bodily injury. [10] The offense becomes a class A felony with up to a $50,000 (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt) fine if the illicit fireworks caused serious bodily injury or death. [10]",
  "policy_impact": "The bill establishes new offenses, such as making sending or receiving fireworks by air delivery a class C felony. [10] Heightened penalties could be applied if the offender was previously convicted of a crime under chapter 132D, HRS, within ten years, or if illicit fireworks cause substantial bodily injury, serious bodily injury, or death. [10] The level of offense for purchasing, possessing, setting off, igniting, or discharging controlled fireworks or articles pyrotechnic without a permit would be based on weight, with fifty pounds or more being a class B felony. [10]",
  "revenue_sources": "The bill establishes a $300 (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt) fine for purchasing, possessing, or setting off less than five pounds of illicit aerial devices, display fireworks, or articles pyrotechnic. [10] Other penalties for standalone offenses range from a $200 (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt) fine to a $10,000 (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt) fine for a class C felony. [10] Once a fireworks citation is issued, the recipient may then pay the fine, mail-in an explanation to the court, or request a live hearing before a judge, similar to a traffic infraction. [10]",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The establishment of non-criminal fireworks infractions would allow law enforcement agencies and courts to hold a much higher number of individuals accountable for their use of illicit fireworks quickly and safely. [10] The bill establishes a $300 (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt) fine for infractions involving small amounts of illicit aerial devices. [10] Enhanced penalties for more serious offenses could result in fines of up to $50,000 (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt). [10]",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The measure now explicitly states that it appropriates moneys for its purposes. [11] New testimony from the Department of the Attorney General details the rationale for a tiered penalty structure, with specific fines ranging from $200 (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt) to $50,000 (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt). [10] The non-criminal infraction system is designed to be similar to traffic citations, allowing for quick issuance and increased enforcement efficiency. [10] New testimony was received from various agencies and Hawaii Explosives and Pyrotechnics, the latter of which expressed concerns that the bill may adversely affect permitted commercial displays.
