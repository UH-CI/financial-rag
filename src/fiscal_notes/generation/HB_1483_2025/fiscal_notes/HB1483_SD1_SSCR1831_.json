  "overview": "The purpose of this measure is to strengthen state fireworks laws by amending definitions, increasing certain penalties, establishing new criminal offenses, and establishing non-criminal fireworks infractions for the lowest-level offenses. [10] This bill addresses concerns raised by prosecutors and provides clarity and efficiency for law enforcement, prosecutors, and courts that handle these cases. [10] The measure establishes processes relating to the adjudication of fireworks infractions and appropriates moneys to carry out its purpose. [11]",
  "appropriations": "The Hawaii County Police Department is grateful to see that the Bill includes monetary appropriation, in amounts yet to be determined, to carry out the purposes of the Bill. [10] The committee report confirms that the measure appropriates moneys. [11] The Hawaiian Humane Society testimony also notes that the bill appropriates funds. [10]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The bill's structure is based on the premise that Hawaiiâ€™s laws regarding illicit fireworks have made it difficult for state and county agencies to enforce or prosecute cases due to challenges in gathering evidence and meeting a high burden of proof. [10] The establishment of non-criminal infractions is assumed to allow law enforcement agencies and courts to hold a much higher number of individuals accountable for their use of illicit fireworks quickly and safely, similar to how non-criminal traffic citations are issued. [10] Due to the lower standard of proof for fireworks infractions, these citations could be issued very quickly and easily, without requiring any further investigation. [10]",
  "agency_impact": "The Honolulu Police Department, Hawaii County Police Department, and the Department of the Prosecuting Attorney for Maui all support the measure, stating it will improve enforcement and help protect the community. [10] [10] [10] The Department of the Attorney General believes the bill will allow for more efficient use of limited resources at certain critical times of the year, as an officer could issue multiple fireworks citations without having to spend additional time interviewing witnesses, collecting evidence, or writing police reports. [10] [10] The Department of the Attorney General also recommends amendments, such as creating a new chapter in the Hawaii Revised Statutes for the adjudication process rather than placing it under the title for motor vehicles. [10] [10]",
  "economic_impact": "Better enforcement of fireworks control laws is essential to safeguard property from preventable fire damage and protect the community from injuries related to fires and explosions. [10] The use of illegal fireworks causes respiratory distress stemming from fireworks smoke and annual trauma to humans and animals stemming from loud fireworks explosions. [10] Unauthorized fireworks place a heavy burden on emergency responders, diverting resources away from critical situations. [10]",
  "policy_impact": "This bill separates various prohibited acts based on the level of dangerousness and places them under standalone offenses with penalties proportionate to the acts. [10] It establishes non-criminal fireworks infractions for the lowest-level offenses, with an adjudication process controlled by chapter 291D, HRS, similar to traffic infractions. [10] [10] The Department of the Attorney General has recommended that the Legislature consider adding a new chapter to Title 38 of the HRS to address the adjudication process for all fireworks infractions, as they are not appropriately placed under Title 17, which pertains to motor vehicles. [10] [10]",
  "revenue_sources": "Revenue will be generated from a new penalty structure for fireworks offenses. [10] Penalties for standalone offenses range from an infraction carrying a $200 (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt) fine to class C felonies facing up to a $10,000 (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt) fine. [10] [10] The bill also establishes a $300 (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt) fine for purchasing, possessing, or setting off small amounts of certain illicit fireworks. [10]",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The bill includes a monetary appropriation of an undetermined amount to carry out its purposes. [10] Ongoing costs will be incurred by law enforcement and the courts to manage the new fireworks infraction adjudication system. [10] The bill is expected to generate revenue through a revised penalty structure. [10] Penalties include a $200 (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt) fine for certain infractions and a $300 (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt) fine for possessing less than five pounds of illicit aerial devices. [10] [10] Criminal offenses, such as distributing aerial devices without a permit, would normally be a class C felony with a fine up to $10,000 (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt). [10] This can be enhanced to a class B felony with a fine up to $25,000 (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt) if the offender has a prior conviction or if the fireworks cause substantial bodily injury. [10] The penalty can become a class A felony with a fine up to $50,000 (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt) if the illicit fireworks cause serious bodily injury or death. [10] The more efficient infraction system is designed to allow law enforcement to hold a much higher number of individuals accountable, which may increase fine revenue over time. [10]",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The measure will generate new operating revenue through fines established for non-criminal fireworks infractions and increased criminal penalties. [10] [10] The bill establishes a $300 (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt) fine for infractions involving small amounts of illicit aerial devices, and other infractions carry a $200 (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt) fine. [10] [10] Enhanced penalties for serious criminal offenses can increase fines to as much as $25,000 (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt) or $50,000 (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt). [10] [10]",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "There is no new information regarding capital expenditures in the provided documents. [10] The documents do not mention any specific investments in facilities, equipment, or technology infrastructure. [10]",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The establishment of a permanent adjudication system for fireworks infractions will result in ongoing operational costs for law enforcement and the judiciary beyond the initial implementation period. [10] The system is designed to allow for more efficient and sustained enforcement, which will require continued funding for processing citations. [10] Fine collections will provide a continuous, albeit variable, source of revenue dependent on enforcement levels and public compliance. [10]",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "New testimony from the Department of the Attorney General provides a detailed rationale for establishing a non-criminal infraction system, likening it to traffic citations to improve efficiency and address prosecutorial challenges. [10] The new documents offer a much more specific breakdown of the proposed penalty structure, with fines ranging from $200 (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt) for minor infractions to as high as $50,000 (HB1483_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_04-04-25_.PDF.txt) for felonies causing serious injury or death. [10] [10] Unlike the previous note, this analysis includes explicit written support from the Honolulu Police Department and Hawaii County Police Department. [10] [10] A significant new policy detail is the Attorney General's recommendation to create a new chapter in the Hawaii Revised Statutes for fireworks infractions rather than amending the motor vehicle code.
