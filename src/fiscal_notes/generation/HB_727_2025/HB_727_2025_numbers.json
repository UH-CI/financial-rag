On Hawaiʻi Island, women confronted with these challenges face unique barriers to treatment and recovery—and not only in the area of mental health services. Hawaiʻi County is a large, rural county spanning over 4,000 square miles6; many areas of the island are remote and have poor or nonexistent access to critical services, such as public transportation and medical care. Hawaiʻi County also has the highest poverty rate in the State at 13.8%, with an average household income of only $68,3997—with the poorest areas of the County having a median household income of only $50,313 per year.8 Hawaiʻi Island also has high rates of domestic violence.

Hawaiʻi County also has the highest poverty rate in the State at 13.8%, with an average household income of only $68,3998—with the poorest areas of the County having a median household income of only $50,313 per year.9 Hawaiʻi Island also has high rates of domestic violence.
