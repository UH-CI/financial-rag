  "overview": "This measure makes the Women's Court Pilot Program in the First Circuit permanent. [8] It establishes a three-year women's court pilot program in the circuit court of the Kona division of the third circuit. [8] The judiciary is required to submit a report to the legislature regarding the need for and the associated costs of a pilot program for women's court in the second and fifth circuits and Hilo division of the third circuit. [8]",
  "appropriations": "The legislative document specifies an appropriation out of the general revenues of $514,900 (HB727_SD1_.HTM.txt) for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 (HB727_SD1_.HTM.txt) for fiscal year 2026-2027. [8] These funds are for mental health, substance abuse treatment, and other services, and for the establishment of two temporary positions: one full-time equivalent (1.0 FTE) Kona drug court probation supervisor and one full-time equivalent (1.0 FTE) peer specialist. [8] In testimony, the Judiciary submitted a three-year budget proposal for the pilot project totaling $1,576,900 (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt), indicating a funding shortfall for the third year of the program as the bill only appropriates funds for two years.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The Judiciary's fiscal request is based on a detailed proposal for a three-year pilot project in the Kona division, which was updated from an initial two-year proposal to reflect the current version of the bill. The proposal accounts for the severe shortage of community-based mental health services on Hawai ªi Island by seeking funding for direct-provider positions and services. [7] [7] The budget also includes costs for staff training, technology, program evaluation, and various contracted services such as Moral Reconation Therapy and increased drug testing capabilities. [7]",
  "agency_impact": "The women's court pilot program will be established within the third circuit Kona division of the judiciary and shall be under the supervision of the big island drug court. [8] This structure is intended to leverage the existing Big Island Drug Court staff and resources at the outset of the program. [7] The Department of Health anticipates providing support for the Kona pilot project and has requested positions including a 1.0 FTE Clinical Psychologist ($145,000 (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt)) and a 1.0 FTE Social Worker/Human Services Professional IV ($76,788 (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt)).",

  "policy_impact": "This measure has been substantially amended to make the Women's Court Pilot Program in the First Circuit permanent.
