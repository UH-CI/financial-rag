  "overview": "This measure makes the Women's Court pilot program in the First Circuit (Mohala Wahine) permanent. It also establishes a new, temporary three-year Women's Court pilot program in the Kona division of the Third Circuit, to be operated under the supervision of the Big Island Drug Court. Additionally, the bill requires the Judiciary to submit a report on the feasibility and costs of expanding the program to the Second and Fifth Circuits, as well as the Hilo division of the Third Circuit.",
  "appropriations": "The committee hearing determines an appropriation of $514,900 (HB727_SD1) for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 (HB727_SD1) for fiscal year 2026-2027 for the Women's Court pilot program in the Kona division of the Third Circuit. This funding is designated for services and two temporary positions. The previously discussed appropriation request from the Department of Health has been deleted from the measure.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The cost estimation methodology has been revised to reflect the Judiciary's specific proposal for a two-year pilot program in Kona, which totals $1,071,900 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-19-25_). This approach is based on the need to fund direct services and provider positions, such as a full-time mental health professional, due to the documented lack of community-based mental health resources in West Hawai'i. This replaces the previous methodology which was based on the Department of Health's staffing model for the First Circuit.",
  "agency_impact": "The Judiciary's proposal to host the pilot program has been adopted, officially establishing the pilot in the Kona division of the Third Circuit under the supervision of the Big Island Drug Court. This change replaces the original plan for the Second and Fifth Circuits. Consequently, the requirement for the Third Circuit to conduct an interim study has been removed, as it will now be implementing the program directly.",
  "economic_impact": "The program is now specifically designed to address the service gap for the most at-risk women in West Hawai ªi, a region noted for having the highest poverty rate in the state and high rates of domestic violence. By providing targeted, trauma-informed services, the pilot aims to reduce recidivism among a high-need population, leading to long-term cost savings associated with incarceration and improving community safety. The ultimate goal of the Judiciary's model is to make the program permanent and expand it, suggesting a strategy for sustained economic benefit.",
  "policy_impact": "This measure now makes the First Circuit's Mohala Wahine program permanent, shifting its status from a temporary pilot to an established specialty court. It formally adopts the Judiciary's alternative model by situating the new pilot program within the Third Circuit's existing Big Island Drug Court structure, acknowledging that a different approach is needed for neighbor islands. A new policy directive has been added, requiring the Judiciary to report to the Legislature on the feasibility of future expansions to the Second, Fifth, and Hilo circuits.",
  "revenue_sources": "",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The six-year outlook has substantially changed, now centering on a two-year pilot in the Third Circuit's Kona division with specific appropriations of $514,900 (HB727_SD1) for year one and $557,000 (HB727_SD1) for year two. This funding is for two temporary positions and contracted services, including a Women's Mental Health Professional at $175,000 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-19-25_) per year, behavioral health beds at $100,000 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-19-25_) per year, and a peer specialist at $80,000 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-19-25_) per year. The previously anticipated annual cost of over $1,600,000 for the Department of Health to support pilots in two other circuits has been eliminated. The most significant long-term fiscal implication is the creation of a permanent Women's Court in the First Circuit, which will require ongoing state funding for its operations beyond the initial pilot period. The Judiciary's goal is to eventually make the Third Circuit program permanent and expand it to Hilo, which would create additional ongoing fiscal obligations.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The Judiciary's accepted budget proposal includes a new, one-time capital expenditure of $4,900 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-19-25_) in the first year for technology to support program operations in Kona. These funds are for items such as a computer workstation for client use, computers and a printer for the new probation supervisor, and a laptop for fieldwork. No other capital expenditures are anticipated.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The primary long-term fiscal implication is the new, permanent status of the Women's Court in the First Circuit, which will require sustained annual operational funding. Should the two-year Kona pilot prove successful, it is the Judiciary's stated goal to seek permanent status and expand the program to Hilo. This would create another significant and recurring fiscal obligation to fund staff and direct mental health services in the Third Circuit.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The pilot program's location has been officially changed from the Second and Fifth Circuits to the Kona division of the Third Circuit, adopting the Judiciary's detailed proposal. Correspondingly, appropriations are now specified as $514,900 (HB727_SD1) for FY 2025-2026 and $557,000 (HB727_SD1) for FY 2026-2027 for the Judiciary, and the previously requested Department of Health funding has been removed from the measure. A major policy shift makes the First Circuit's Women's Court program permanent, creating an ongoing fiscal obligation. The interim study for the Third Circuit has been replaced by the pilot itself, and a new reporting requirement has been added for the Judiciary to study expansion to other circuits."
