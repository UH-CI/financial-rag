  "overview": "The central conflict between the legislature and the Judiciary has been resolved, as the bill now officially establishes the pilot program in the Third Circuit's Kona division, aligning with the Judiciary's proposal. A significant new component is making the existing First Circuit women's court program permanent by removing its sunset clause. The previously proposed pilot for the Second and Fifth circuits has been replaced with a requirement for the Judiciary to study the need for programs in those locations.",
  "appropriations": "The bill now contains specific appropriations for the Third Circuit pilot program: $514,900 for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027. These funds are designated for mental health services, substance abuse treatment, and the creation of two temporary positions: a probation supervisor and a peer specialist. The previously noted appropriation request from the Department of Health has been removed from the measure.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The financial projections are no longer based on competing models but are now directly aligned with the Judiciary's detailed two-year budget proposal for the Kona Women's Court. The appropriated amounts of $514,900 for Year 1 and $557,000 for Year 2 directly correspond to the budget table provided in the Judiciary's testimony. This methodology includes funding for a mix of contracted professional services, dedicated behavioral health beds, and new temporary Judiciary staff positions.",
  "agency_impact": "The Judiciary's requested amendments have been fully incorporated, aligning the legislative mandate with the agency's operational plan for a two-year pilot in the Third Circuit's Kona division under the Big Island Drug Court. The Department of Health is no longer directly funded or staffed through this measure, which significantly reduces its operational impact compared to the previous version of the bill. The Judiciary is now also responsible for conducting a study on expansion to other circuits.",
  "economic_impact": "By making the First Circuit's Mohala Wahine program permanent, the bill solidifies the long-term potential for economic benefits, such as reduced recidivism and increased workforce participation from its graduates. Previously, these benefits were tied to a temporary pilot, but permanence provides a more stable foundation for sustained positive economic outcomes. The newly funded pilot in the Third Circuit initiates the potential for similar economic benefits in that community.",
  "policy_impact": "The policy debate regarding program implementation has been resolved in favor of a localized, tailored approach, with the legislature adopting the Judiciary's proposal for the Third Circuit. The bill now establishes a new, phased statewide strategy: making a successful pilot program (First Circuit) permanent while simultaneously initiating a new, distinct pilot (Third Circuit) and studying further expansion. This shift reflects an evidence-based approach to scaling specialty court programs.",
  "revenue_sources": "",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The fiscal implications are now concretely defined for a two-year period, with appropriations of $514,900 in FY26 and $557,000 in FY27 for the Third Circuit pilot. Making the First Circuit program permanent solidifies a recurring general fund operational cost that will continue indefinitely beyond its original pilot period. The required study on the Second, Fifth, and Hilo divisions may lead to future fiscal requests for additional pilot programs in subsequent years, potentially expanding the program's long-term financial footprint.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The newly adopted budget for the Third Circuit pilot includes a one-time technology expenditure of $4,900 in the first fiscal year. This funding is allocated for essential equipment including computer workstations for clients and staff, a printer, a laptop for rural community work, and a cellphone for fieldwork. No other major capital expenditures are specified in the measure.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "Making the First Circuit pilot program permanent creates a definite and ongoing annual fiscal obligation for the state that will continue indefinitely. While the Third Circuit pilot currently has a sunset date, its establishment creates a precedent for it to become permanent if successful, which would add another recurring annual cost. The mandated study for other circuits suggests a potential for further statewide expansion and associated long-term fiscal commitments.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The primary update is the resolution of the disagreement over the pilot program's location; the bill now establishes the pilot in the Third Circuit's Kona division as requested by the Judiciary. Specific appropriations of $514,900 for FY26 and $557,000 for FY27, matching the Judiciary's budget proposal, have been inserted. A major new development is that the bill makes the First Circuit's Mohala Wahine program permanent, removing its sunset clause and creating an ongoing general fund obligation."
