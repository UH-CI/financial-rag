  "overview": "This Act makes the women's court pilot program in the first circuit permanent. [8] It also establishes a temporary three-year women's court pilot program in the circuit court of the Kona division of the third circuit. [8] The bill requires the judiciary to submit a report to the legislature regarding the need for and the associated costs of a pilot program for women's court in the second and fifth circuits and Hilo division of the third circuit. [8]",
  "appropriations": "There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $514,900 (HB727_SD1_.HTM.txt) or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 (HB727_SD1_.HTM.txt) or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2026-2027. [8] These funds are for mental health, substance abuse treatment, and other services, and the establishment of two temporary positions. [8] The positions are one full-time equivalent (1.0 FTE) Kona drug court probation supervisor position and one full-time equivalent (1.0 FTE) peer specialist position. [8]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The appropriation amounts of $514,900 (HB727_SD1_SSCR1240_.htm.txt) for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 (HB727_SD1_SSCR1240_.htm.txt) for fiscal year 2026-2027 align with the Judiciary's proposed budget for a two-year pilot program detailed in public testimony. [9] The Third Circuit's proposal calls for the Kona Womenâ€™s Court program to be supervised by the Kona Division of Big Island Drug Court (BIDC), leveraging its existing structure and staff. [7] This structure is intended to maximize existing resources and allow the program to focus its efforts on developing programming and services. [7]",
  "agency_impact": "There shall be established within the third circuit Kona division of the judiciary the women's court pilot program. [8] The women's court pilot program shall be under the supervision of the big island drug court. [8] The judiciary is required to submit reports on the pilot program's status to the legislature prior to the regular sessions of 2026, 2027, and 2028, and a separate report on the need for programs in other circuits prior to the 2026 session. [8] [8]",
  "economic_impact": "The goal of the pilot program is diverting participants from incarceration, supporting their success in the community, and reducing recidivism. [8] Research reflects that women offenders face unique barriers to success after incarceration, including being primary caregivers for young children, having lower educational attainment, and lacking stable work history. [8] [8] By reducing recidivism and prioritizing rehabilitation over incarceration, HB 727 will increase public safety and strengthen our community. [7]",
  "policy_impact": "This Act makes the women's court pilot program in the first circuit permanent by amending Act 243, Session Laws of Hawaii 2022. [8] [8] It establishes a new temporary three-year Women's Court Pilot Program within the Kona division of the Third Circuit, rather than in the Second and Fifth Circuits as previously proposed. [8] [9] The measure also deletes the requirement for the Third Circuit to conduct an interim study and instead requires a report on the need for a pilot program in the Second and Fifth Circuits and Hilo division of the Third Circuit. [9] [9]",
  "revenue_sources": "The measure appropriates funds out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii. [8] The sums appropriated are $514,900 (HB727_SD1_.HTM.txt) for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 (HB727_SD1_.HTM.txt) for fiscal year 2026-2027. [8] These sums are to be expended by the judiciary for the purposes of this Act. [8]",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The bill establishes a temporary three-year Women's Court Pilot Program in the Kona division of the Third Circuit. [8] Part III of the Act, which establishes the pilot program, is repealed on June 30, 2028. [8] The measure appropriates $514,900 (HB727_SD1_.HTM.txt) for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 (HB727_SD1_.HTM.txt) for fiscal year 2026-2027. [8] The appropriations are for mental health, substance abuse treatment, and other services, as well as two temporary positions: a 1.0 FTE Kona drug court probation supervisor and a 1.0 FTE peer specialist. [8] A third year of funding would be required for FY 2027-2028 to complete the three-year pilot. [8] The Judiciary's testimony provides a cost estimate for the third year of a similar proposal at $515,000 (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt). [7] The Act also makes the women's court pilot program in the first circuit permanent, which will have ongoing fiscal implications beyond the six-year period, though no specific funding is appropriated in this bill for that purpose. [8] [9] The judiciary must submit reports to the legislature, which will include recommendations as to whether the pilot program should continue, expand, or be discontinued. [8] [8] The cost of future operations beyond the pilot period would be subject to future legislative action. [8]",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The provided legislative documents do not specify any anticipated impact on operating revenues. [8] The measure appropriates funds from the general revenues of the State of Hawaii for program expenditures. [8] No revenue-generating components are included in the bill. [8]",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The Judiciary's testimony requests funding for technology to support program operations. [7] The proposed technology budget is $4,900 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-19-25_.PDF.txt), which includes items such as a computer workstation, computers, a printer, and a laptop. [7] [7] These costs appear to be included within the total appropriation for the first fiscal year of the pilot program. [7] [8]",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "Part III of the Act establishing the women's court pilot program in the Third Circuit is set to be repealed on June 30, 2028. [8] However, the bill makes the Women's Court Pilot Program in the First Circuit permanent, indicating ongoing fiscal responsibilities for that program beyond the initial six-year timeframe. [8] [8] Any fiscal implications for the Third Circuit program after the pilot's sunset date will depend on future legislation based on the Judiciary's reports and recommendations. [8]",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The measure now makes the Women's Court Pilot Program in the First Circuit permanent. [8] The bill has been amended to establish a three-year Women's Court Pilot Program in the circuit court of the Kona division of the Third Circuit, rather than the Second and Fifth Circuits. [9] The requirement for the Third Circuit to conduct an interim study was deleted; instead, the Judiciary is now required to submit a report on the need for a pilot program in the Second and Fifth Circuits and the Hilo division of the Third Circuit. [9] [9] Specific appropriations for the Judiciary have been inserted, with $514,900 (HB727_SD1_SSCR1240_.htm.txt) for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 (HB727_SD1_SSCR1240_.htm.txt) for fiscal year 2026-2027, and language that would have appropriated funds to the Department of Health has been deleted.
