[8]",

  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The Third Circuit's proposal requests the bill to be amended to reflect a two-year program for the Big Island.

  "agency_impact": "The Third Circuit has submitted a detailed proposal for the establishment of a two-year Women’s Court pilot project in the Kona Division of the Third Circuit Court. [7] The Kona Women’s Court (“KWC”) program would operate as a separate program under the supervision of Big Island Drug Court (“BIDC”). [7] To be successful, the Judiciary states the program will require sufficient funding and positions, including a Women’s Mental Health Professional, a Kona Probation Supervisor, and a Drug Court Peer Specialist. [7]",
  "economic_impact": "Your Committee finds that Hawaii County has the highest poverty rate in the State, high rates of domestic violence, and limited opportunities for employment, all of which disproportionately impact women.
