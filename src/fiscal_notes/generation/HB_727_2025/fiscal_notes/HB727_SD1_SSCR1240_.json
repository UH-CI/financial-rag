  "overview": "The purpose of this Act is to make the women's court pilot program in the first circuit permanent; establish a three-year women's court pilot program in the circuit court of the Kona division of the third circuit; and require the judiciary to submit a report to the legislature regarding the need for and the associated costs of a pilot program for women's court in the second and fifth circuits and Hilo division of the third circuit. [8] [8] [8] The part of the act establishing the new pilot program in the Third Circuit is repealed on June 30, 2028. [8]",
  "appropriations": "There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $514,900 (HB727_SD1_.HTM.txt) or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 (HB727_SD1_.HTM.txt) or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2026-2027. [8] The funds are for mental health, substance abuse treatment, and other services; and the establishment of two temporary positions. [8] The positions are one full-time equivalent (1.0 FTE) Kona drug court probation supervisor position and one full-time equivalent (1.0 FTE) peer specialist position. [8]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The Judiciary's proposal for the Kona Women's Court (“KWC”) program envisions it as a division of Kona drug court that will use the established structures of drug court as its “backbone”. [7] [7] A detailed proposal from the Judiciary for a three-year pilot project estimates a total cost of $1,576,900 (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt). [NUMBER_176] The appropriations in the bill for the first two years, $514,900 (HB727_SD1_.HTM.txt) for FY 2025-2026 and $557,000 (HB727_SD1_.HTM.txt) for FY 2026-2027, align with the Judiciary's initial two-year cost projections. [8] [7]",
  "agency_impact": "This measure establishes a three-year Women's Court Pilot Program in the circuit court of the Kona division of the Third Circuit, under the supervision of the Big Island Drug Court. [9] The Judiciary is appropriated funds for two temporary positions: a 1.0 FTE Kona drug court probation supervisor and a 1.0 FTE peer specialist. [8] The Judiciary is required to submit a report to the Legislature regarding the need for and the associated costs of a pilot program for Women's Court in the Second and Fifth Circuits and Hilo division of the Third Circuit, as well as annual reports on the status of the Kona pilot program. [9] [8]",
  "economic_impact": "The goal of the pilot program is diverting participants from incarceration, supporting their success in the community, and reducing recidivism. [8] Expansion to the other circuits would allow the program to assist more women in need and divert them away from incarceration. [7] The focused approach ensures that justice-involved women are given an opportunity to rebuild their lives, contributing positively to society rather than being trapped in cycles of crime and incarceration. [7]",
  "policy_impact": "This Act makes the women's court pilot program in the first circuit permanent by amending Act 243, Session Laws of Hawaii 2022, to remove its repeal date. [8] It establishes a new, temporary three-year Women's Court Pilot Program in the circuit court of the Kona division of the Third Circuit, rather than in the Second and Fifth Circuits as proposed in a previous version of the measure. [9] This measure also deletes language that would have required the Third Circuit to conduct an interim study and instead requires a report on the need for similar pilot programs in other circuits. [9] [9]",
  "revenue_sources": "There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $514,900 (HB727_SD1_.HTM.txt) or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 (HB727_SD1_.HTM.txt) or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2026-2027. [8] The sums appropriated shall be expended by the judiciary for the purposes of this Act. [8] No other revenue sources are specified in the provided documents.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "This measure makes the Women's Court Pilot Program in the First Circuit permanent, which will create ongoing fiscal obligations, though no specific costs for this permanent program are provided in the current documents. [9] For the new three-year pilot program in the Kona division of the Third Circuit, the bill appropriates $514,900 (HB727_SD1_.HTM.txt) for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 (HB727_SD1_.HTM.txt) for fiscal year 2026-2027. [8] The Judiciary's testimony outlines a three-year budget proposal totaling $1,576,900 (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt), with year three estimated to cost $515,000 (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt). [NUMBER_176, NUMBER_174] The bill does not include an appropriation for the third year of the pilot program. [8] The appropriation is for services and two temporary positions: one full-time equivalent (1.0 FTE) Kona drug court probation supervisor position and one full-time equivalent (1.0 FTE) peer specialist position. [8] The Judiciary’s proposal identifies additional necessary services and positions, including a Women's Mental Health Professional at an annual cost of $175,000 (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt) and Women's Behavioral Health Beds at $100,000 (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt) annually. [NUMBER_98, NUMBER_106] The pilot program in the Third Circuit is set to be repealed on June 30, 2028. [8] The Judiciary is required to submit annual reports with recommendations on whether the pilot program should continue, expand, or be discontinued, which will inform future fiscal considerations. [8]",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The provided documents do not describe any anticipated impacts on operating revenues resulting from the program. [8] The measure appropriates funds for program expenditures from the State's general revenues. [8] There is no indication that the Women's Court pilot program is intended to generate revenue. [8]",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The Judiciary's testimony includes a request for technology funding totaling $4,900 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-19-25_.PDF.txt) in the first year of the pilot program. [CHUNK_162, NUMBER_53] This includes costs for a computer workstation ($1,200 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-19-25_.PDF.txt)), a computer for the supervisor ($1,000 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-19-25_.PDF.txt)), a printer ($1,000 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-19-25_.PDF.txt)), a cellphone ($500 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-19-25_.PDF.txt)), and a laptop ($1,200 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-19-25_.PDF.txt)). [7] [7] No other capital expenditures are mentioned in the provided documents.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "This Act makes the women's court pilot program in the first circuit permanent, which indicates ongoing fiscal obligations beyond the six-year outlook for that circuit. [8] The pilot program established in the Third Circuit is temporary and Part III of the Act is to be repealed on June 30, 2028. [8] Any long-term fiscal implications for a Women's Court in the Third Circuit would be contingent upon future legislation based on the findings and recommendations from the pilot program's required reports. [8]",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "This measure's focus has significantly shifted from the previous version; it now makes the First Circuit's Women's Court program permanent and establishes a new three-year pilot program in the Kona division of the Third Circuit, rather than in the Second and Fifth Circuits. [9] [9] The Third Circuit is no longer tasked with conducting an interim study but will instead directly implement the new pilot. [9] The bill now specifies general fund appropriations for the Judiciary, inserting an appropriation amount of $514,900 (HB727_SD1_SSCR1240_.htm.txt) for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 (HB727_SD1_SSCR1240_.htm.txt) for fiscal year 2026-2027, and deletes language that would have appropriated funds to the Department of Health.
