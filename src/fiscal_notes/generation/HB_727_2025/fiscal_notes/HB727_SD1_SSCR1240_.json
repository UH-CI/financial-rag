  "overview": "The purpose of this Act is to make the women's court pilot program in the first circuit permanent. [8] It also establishes a three-year women's court pilot program in the circuit court of the Kona division of the third circuit. [8] Additionally, the Act requires the judiciary to submit a report to the legislature regarding the need for and the associated costs of a pilot program for women's court in the second and fifth circuits and Hilo division of the third circuit. [8]",
  "appropriations": "There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $514,900 (HB727_SD1_.HTM.txt) or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 (HB727_SD1_.HTM.txt) or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2026-2027. [8] These funds are for mental health, substance abuse treatment, and other services, and the establishment of two temporary positions. [8] The sums appropriated shall be expended by the judiciary for the purposes of this Act. [8]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The provided documents do not specify the assumptions or methodology used to determine the appropriation amounts. [8] However, the Committee on Judiciary finds that closing the service gap for the most at-risk women in the Kona area of the Third District is imperative, based on data and information provided by the Judiciary in testimony at the public hearing on this measure. [9] The committee also notes the Third Circuit is at a disadvantage to address crime motivators due to limited community resources, funding, and geographic restrictions. [9]",
  "agency_impact": "The Judiciary will be responsible for making the Women's Court Pilot Program in the First Circuit permanent. [8] The Judiciary will also establish the women's court pilot program within the third circuit Kona division, which will be under the supervision of the big island drug court. [8] The Judiciary is also required to submit multiple reports to the legislature regarding the new pilot program and the need for programs in other circuits. [8] [8]",
  "economic_impact": "This measure aims to support women dealing with trauma, abuse, and unhealthy relationships by providing substance abuse treatment and mental health support. [9] [9] The pilot program's goal is to divert participants from incarceration, support their success in the community, and reduce recidivism. [8] This addresses issues in Hawaii County, which has the highest poverty rate in the State, high rates of domestic violence, and limited opportunities for employment, all of which disproportionately impact women. [9]",
  "policy_impact": "This Act makes the women's court pilot program in the first circuit permanent by amending Act 243, Session Laws of Hawaii 2022, to remove its repeal date. [8] It establishes a new temporary three-year Women's Court Pilot Program within the Kona division of the Third Circuit. [8] The measure also shifts the focus from a previously proposed interim study for the Third Circuit to requiring a report on the need for pilot programs in the Second and Fifth Circuits and the Hilo division of the Third Circuit. [9] [9]",
  "revenue_sources": "The bill appropriates funds out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii.

[8] The Kona pilot program is established as a three-year program, suggesting a third year of funding will be required for fiscal year 2027-2028, though no amount is specified.

[8] Additionally, the judiciary must submit reports in 2026, 2027, and 2028 on the status of the Kona pilot program, including recommendations on whether it should continue or be expanded.
