  "overview": "The purpose of this Act is to make the women's court pilot program in the first circuit permanent. [8] It also establishes a three-year women's court pilot program in the circuit court of the Kona division of the third circuit. [8] The bill requires the judiciary to submit a report to the legislature regarding the need for and the associated costs of a pilot program for women's court in the second and fifth circuits and Hilo division of the third circuit. [8]",
  "appropriations": "There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $514,900 (HB727_SD1_.HTM.txt) or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 (HB727_SD1_.HTM.txt) or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2026-2027. [8] The funds are for mental health, substance abuse treatment, and other services; and the establishment of two temporary positions. [8] The sums appropriated shall be expended by the judiciary for the purposes of this Act. [8]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The Judiciary's proposal envisions the Kona Women's Court (KWC) as a division of Kona drug court, using the established structures of drug court as its 'backbone'. [7] [7] This structure is intended to guarantee the most effective use of resources and maximum benefit to the target population of women. [7] The two-year pilot program budget proposed by the Third Circuit totals $1,071,900 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-19-25_.PDF.txt), with Year 1 costs at $514,900 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-19-25_.PDF.txt) and Year 2 costs at $557,000 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-19-25_.PDF.txt). [7]",
  "agency_impact": "The women's court pilot program shall be established within the third circuit Kona division of the judiciary and shall be under the supervision of the big island drug court. [8] This measure requires the establishment of two temporary positions: one full-time equivalent (1.0 FTE) Kona drug court probation supervisor position and one full-time equivalent (1.0 FTE) peer specialist position. [8] The judiciary shall submit a report of its findings and recommendations to the governor and legislature no later than forty days prior to the convening of the regular sessions of 2026, 2027, and 2028 regarding the status of the pilot program. [8] [8]",
  "economic_impact": "The Third Circuit, specifically the Kona area, is at a disadvantage to address crime motivators such as substance abuse, mental health, and homelessness, given its limited community resources and funding. [9] Hawaii County has the highest poverty rate in the State, high rates of domestic violence, and limited opportunities for employment, all of which disproportionately impact women. [9] The pilot program has the goal of diverting participants from incarceration, supporting their success in the community, and reducing recidivism. [8]",
  "policy_impact": "This Act makes the women's court pilot program in the first circuit permanent by repealing its sunset date. [8] [8] It establishes a three-year Women's Court Pilot Program in the circuit court of the Kona division of the Third Circuit, rather than the Second and Fifth Circuits. [9] This measure also deletes language that would have required the Third Circuit of the Judiciary and Big Island Drug Court to conduct an interim study, instead requiring a report on the need and costs for a pilot program in other circuits. [9] [9]",
  "revenue_sources": "There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $514,900 (HB727_SD1_.HTM.txt) for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 (HB727_SD1_.HTM.txt) for fiscal year 2026-2027.

[7] [7] [7] Year 2 costs are similar, but training increases to $42,000 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-19-25_.PDF.txt) for the Kona Team to travel to the national All Rise conference. [7] [7] [7] A cost for Program Evaluation of $10,000 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-19-25_.PDF.txt) is also added in Year 2. [7] The bill appropriates funds for two temporary positions: a Kona drug court probation supervisor and a peer specialist. [8] The pilot program established in Part III of the bill is repealed on June 30, 2028. [8] The measure also makes the women's court pilot program in the first circuit permanent, which will have ongoing fiscal implications beyond the pilot period. [8]",

[7] [7]",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "This Act makes the women's court pilot program in the first circuit permanent, which will result in ongoing fiscal obligations for the Judiciary. [8] The pilot program in the Third Circuit sunsets on June 30, 2028. [8] However, if the pilot program is successful, the ultimate goal would be to expand the Womenâ€™s Court program to Hilo and make the program permanent. [7]",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The measure has been significantly amended, making the Women's Court Pilot Program in the First Circuit permanent. [9] It now establishes a three-year pilot program in the Kona division of the Third Circuit, rather than in the Second and Fifth Circuits as previously proposed. [9] The bill now includes specific appropriations for the Judiciary, inserting an amount of $514,900 (HB727_SD1_SSCR1240_.htm.txt) for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 (HB727_SD1_SSCR1240_.htm.txt) for fiscal year 2026-2027.
