  "overview": "This measure has been amended to establish a two-year women's court pilot program in the Kona division of the Third Circuit, supervised by the Big Island Drug Court. It removes the previously planned pilot programs for the Second and Fifth Circuits and the associated interim study. A significant new provision makes the First Circuit's Mohala Wahine women's court program permanent.",
  "appropriations": "The measure now specifies appropriations of $514,900 for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027 for the Kona pilot program. These funds will support services and two temporary positions (a Probation Supervisor and a contracted Peer Specialist). All previously discussed appropriations for the Second and Fifth Circuits and the associated Department of Health funding request have been deleted.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "Financial projections are now based on a detailed two-year budget proposal submitted by the Third Circuit Judiciary for the Kona pilot. The methodology accounts for the lack of community-based services in West Hawai'i by directly funding contracted mental health professionals, peer specialists, and behavioral health beds. All cost estimations for staffing, services, training, and technology are derived from this specific Judiciary proposal.",
  "agency_impact": "The operational impact is now concentrated entirely on the Third Circuit Judiciary and the Big Island Drug Court, which will implement and supervise the Kona pilot program. The Judiciary will need to establish one new Probation Supervisor position and manage various service contracts. The previously anticipated operational impacts on the Second and Fifth Circuit courts and the Department of Health have been eliminated from this measure.",
  "economic_impact": "The anticipated economic benefits, such as reduced recidivism and long-term incarceration costs, are now expected to be generated by the targeted pilot program in Kona. This program is specifically designed to address significant local barriers to treatment, including the severe lack of mental health providers, which is expected to improve outcomes for West Hawai'i's highest-risk women. The direct investment in local services aims to create a continuum of care that could yield long-term savings for the state.",
  "policy_impact": "This measure now establishes the First Circuit's Mohala Wahine program as a permanent specialty court, shifting its status from a temporary pilot. It also reverses the previous expansion strategy by prioritizing a pilot in the Third Circuit's Kona division, based on a specific local proposal, while deferring implementation elsewhere. The Judiciary is now required to submit a report on the feasibility and costs of future expansion to the Second and Fifth Circuits and the Hilo division.",
  "revenue_sources": "",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The six-year outlook now includes a two-year pilot in the Third Circuit's Kona division with costs of $514,900 in FY 2026 and $557,000 in FY 2027 for staffing and services. A major new implication is the permanent funding of the First Circuit program, which establishes a recurring annual cost to the state beyond its original pilot phase. A one-time cost will also be incurred in FY 2026 for the Judiciary to produce a report on future expansion. If the Kona pilot is made permanent after FY 2027, its annual cost of over $550,000 would also become a recurring state expense.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The measure now specifies a one-time capital expenditure of $4,900 in fiscal year 2025-2026 for the Kona pilot program. This appropriation is for technology and equipment, including a computer workstation for client use and resources for the new Probation Supervisor position. No other capital expenditures are identified.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The primary long-term fiscal implication is the permanent, recurring annual funding required for the operations of the First Circuit's Mohala Wahine program. Should the two-year Kona pilot program be made permanent, its annual operating costs, estimated to be over $557,000, would also become an ongoing fiscal obligation for the state. Future expansion to other circuits would add further recurring costs.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "This version represents a complete reversal of the previous measure, now establishing a two-year pilot program in the Third Circuit's Kona division while removing the pilots in the Second and Fifth Circuits. A major new provision makes the First Circuit's Mohala Wahine program permanent. Consequently, specific appropriations of $514,900 (FY26) and $557,000 (FY27) are inserted for the Kona pilot, while all funding for the Second and Fifth Circuits, including the Department of Health's request, has been deleted. The interim study for the Third Circuit is replaced with a Judiciary report on future expansion to other neighbor island circuits."
