  "overview": "The purpose of this Act is to make the women's court pilot program in the first circuit permanent and establish a three-year women's court pilot program in the circuit court of the Kona division of the third circuit. [11] The women's court pilot program shall be under the supervision of the big island drug court. [11] The measure requires reports, establishes temporary positions, appropriates funds, and sunsets on 6/30/2028. [10]",
  "appropriations": "The committee has amended this measure by changing the appropriations to unspecified amounts to facilitate further discussion on the measure. [12] The Judiciary requests appropriations to allow the pilot project to be fully funded through fiscal year 2027-2028. [10] The Department of Health requests a budget of $221,788 (HB727_SD2_SSCR1531_.htm.txt) to support the Kona division pilot program. [12]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The proposal for the formation of a Kona Women’s Court program is a 3-year pilot project under the umbrella of the well-established Big Island Drug Court. [10] By developing KWC under the pre-existing drug court program, the KWC pilot project will use the established structures of drug court as its “backbone”. [10] The cost of incarceration of just one person for three years is $277,035.10 (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt), meaning if the program helps keep just six women out of prison, it will have paid for itself. [10] [10]",
  "agency_impact": "There shall be established within the third circuit Kona division of the judiciary the women's court pilot program, under the supervision of the big island drug court. [11] The Department of Health's role will be to provide screening and assessments of possible eligible participants for the program, including forensic mental health consultation and coordination. [10] The Department of Health requests one full-time equivalent Clinical Psychologist for $145,000 (HB727_SD2_SSCR1531_.htm.txt) and one full-time equivalent Social Worker for $76,788 (HB727_SD2_SSCR1531_.htm.txt) to support the pilot project. [12]",
  "economic_impact": "This investment in KWC will ultimately result in cost savings. [10] The average cost of housing an inmate in Hawaiʻi is $253 (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt) dollars per day, which totals $92,945 (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt) per year. [10] [10] Supportive services are far less costly than incarceration when a person reoffends. [10]",
  "policy_impact": "This measure makes the Women's Court pilot program in the First Circuit permanent by amending Act 243, Session Laws of Hawaii 2022, to remove the repeal date. [11] It establishes a three-year Women's Court pilot program in the circuit court of the Kona division of the Third Circuit under the supervision of the Big Island Drug Court. [11] [10] The judiciary is also required to submit a report to the legislature regarding the need for and the associated costs of a pilot program for women's court in the second and fifth circuits and Hilo division of the third circuit. [11]",
  "revenue_sources": "The bill appropriates funds out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii. [11] The sums appropriated shall be expended by the judiciary for the purposes of this Act. [11] No other revenue sources are specified in the provided documents. [11]",

[10] [10] Year 3 costs are also similar, with no funding for training or technology, but includes $10,000 (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt) for Program Evaluation. [10] [10] The bill establishes two temporary positions: one full-time equivalent (1.0 FTE) Kona drug court probation supervisor position and one full-time equivalent (1.0 FTE) peer specialist position. [11] The pilot program established in part III of the Act is set to be repealed on June 30, 2028.

[11] The pilot program in the Third Circuit is temporary and sunsets on June 30, 2028.
