  "overview": "The pilot program for the Third Circuit's Kona division has been extended from a two-year to a three-year plan, with a sunset date of June 30, 2028. The program will require annual progress reports to the legislature during the 2026, 2027, and 2028 regular sessions. The core purposes of making the First Circuit's Mohala Wahine program permanent and studying expansion to other circuits remain unchanged.",
  "appropriations": "A significant change has occurred in appropriations, as the specific funding amounts previously included in the bill have been removed and are now unspecified, pending further legislative discussion. The Judiciary has updated its funding request to cover a three-year pilot, totaling over $1.5 million ($514,900 for FY26, $547,000 for FY27, and $515,000 for FY28). Concurrently, the Department of Health has requested separate funding of $221,788 to provide two staff positions for the pilot program.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The financial model has been updated to reflect the Judiciary's revised three-year pilot program proposal, which extends staffing and service costs over an additional fiscal year. A new cost basis has also been introduced by the Department of Health, which bases its $221,788 request on the staffing required for the existing First Circuit program. The Judiciary's cost-benefit assumption has been refined, calculating that the program's three-year cost would be offset by diverting just six women from incarceration, based on an estimated cost of $277,035 per person for three years of imprisonment.",
  "agency_impact": "The operational timeline for the Judiciary's management of the Kona pilot program is now extended to three years. The Department of Health's potential involvement has been reintroduced, as it has formally requested $221,788 for a clinical psychologist and a social worker to provide screening, assessment, and coordination services. This renews the possibility of a direct operational and budgetary impact on the Department of Health, which was not anticipated in the prior version of the measure.",
  "economic_impact": "The measure now includes a more direct economic justification for the pilot program, based on testimony from the Judiciary. It is estimated that the cost of incarcerating one woman for three years is $277,035. Therefore, the total proposed three-year program cost of approximately $1.5 million would be offset if the program successfully prevents just six participants from being incarcerated for that period.",
  "policy_impact": "The legislative process has shifted from debating the program's structure to negotiating its funding level and scope. By amending the bill to include unspecified appropriation amounts, the Senate Ways and Means Committee has signaled policy agreement on the program's framework but has deferred the final decision on the state's financial commitment. This creates a new policy focus on resolving the competing funding requests from the Judiciary and the Department of Health.",
  "revenue_sources": "",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The fiscal outlook for the new pilot program is now based on a three-year cost projection from the Judiciary, detailing costs of $514,900 in fiscal year 2025-2026, $547,000 in fiscal year 2026-2027, and $515,000 in fiscal year 2027-2028. Although the bill currently contains unspecified appropriations for only the first two years, this three-year budget provides a clearer projection of the pilot's total cost. An additional potential recurring cost of $221,788 annually has been identified based on the Department of Health's request to support the program.",

  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The primary updates are the removal of specific appropriation amounts from the bill, rendering the funding level uncertain pending further negotiation. The Judiciary's proposal, which serves as the basis for fiscal analysis, has been extended from a two-year to a three-year pilot, with a total projected cost of over $1.5 million. Additionally, the Department of Health has re-emerged with a separate funding request of $221,788, and the Judiciary has provided a new economic justification comparing the program's cost to the expense of incarcerating six women for three years."
