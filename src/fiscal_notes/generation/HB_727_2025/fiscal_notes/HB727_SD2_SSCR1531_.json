  "overview": "The proposed pilot program for a Women's Court in the Kona division of the Third Circuit has been extended from two years to three years. The program is now set to sunset on June 30, 2028, reflecting the longer pilot period. The provision to make the First Circuit's Mohala Wahine program permanent remains unchanged.",
  "appropriations": "All specific appropriations for the Kona pilot program have been removed from the measure and changed to unspecified amounts to facilitate further legislative discussion. A new funding request has been introduced by the Department of Health for $221,788 to support the pilot with one full-time Clinical Psychologist and one full-time Social Worker. This request is in addition to the Judiciary's proposal, but is not currently funded in the bill.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "Financial projections are now based on a detailed three-year budget proposal from the Third Circuit Judiciary, totaling $1,576,900. The updated cost estimations are $514,900 for fiscal year 2025-2026, $547,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027, and $515,000 for fiscal year 2027-2028. The Department of Health's new funding request of $221,788 is based on its existing staffing model for the First Circuit Women's Court.",
  "agency_impact": "The Department of Health now anticipates a direct operational impact, as it has requested funding for two full-time positions (a Clinical Psychologist and a Social Worker) to provide screening, assessment, and coordination services for the Kona pilot. This expands the agency impact beyond the Third Circuit Judiciary. The Judiciary's proposed budget and staffing needs for the pilot have also been updated to reflect a three-year term.",
  "economic_impact": "A new cost-benefit analysis from the Judiciary suggests that the total requested investment of over $1.5 million for the three-year pilot would be offset if it prevents just six women from being incarcerated for the same period. This is based on an estimated incarceration cost of $277,035 per person for three years. This provides a more specific metric for evaluating the program's potential for cost savings.",
  "policy_impact": "",
  "revenue_sources": "",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The fiscal outlook for the Kona pilot program has been extended to three years, with projected costs of $514,900 in FY 2026, $547,000 in FY 2027, and $515,000 in FY 2028, according to the Judiciary's detailed request. A new potential recurring cost of $221,788 annually has been introduced by the Department of Health for its own staffing to support the pilot. Although the current appropriations in the bill are unspecified, these figures represent the comprehensive funding levels that will be subject to further legislative discussion. The pilot program now sunsets on June 30, 2028, pushing potential permanent funding considerations to fiscal year 2029.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "While the Judiciary's three-year proposal still includes a one-time technology expenditure of $4,900 in the first year, the current version of the bill has removed all specific line-item funding. Therefore, there is no longer a specified capital expenditure appropriation in the measure as it moves forward. This cost is now part of the overall unspecified appropriation.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The potential ongoing fiscal obligation for the Kona pilot program, should it be made permanent after fiscal year 2028, is now based on a three-year cost structure. The final year's requested operating cost is $515,000, which would likely represent the recurring annual expense, in addition to any recurring costs for the Department of Health's requested positions. This provides a clearer, albeit higher, estimate of the program's long-term costs if it proves successful.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The primary change is the extension of the Kona pilot program from two years to three years, with a new sunset date of June 30, 2028. Consequently, all specific appropriations have been deleted and replaced with unspecified amounts to allow for further discussion. A new, separate funding request of $221,788 from the Department of Health for two positions to support the pilot has been introduced and acknowledged by the legislature."
