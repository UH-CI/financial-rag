[11]",
  "appropriations": "The Committee has amended this measure by changing the appropriations to unspecified amounts to facilitate further discussion on the measure. [12] The Department of Health requests a budget of $221,788 (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt) to support the Kona division pilot project.

[12]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The Judiciary's cost estimate for a three-year pilot project would be $514,000 (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt) for fiscal year 2025-2026, $547,000 (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt) for fiscal year 2026-2027, and $515,000 (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt) for fiscal year 2027-2028. [10] The proposal calls for the Kona Women’s Court program to be supervised by the Kona Division of Big Island Drug Court, which will leverage existing BIDC structure and staff. [10] The Department of Health's request for $221,788 (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt) is based on the Department’s staffing requirements for the operation of the existing Women’s Court pilot project of the First Circuit.

  "agency_impact": "There shall be established within the third circuit Kona division of the judiciary the women's court pilot program, under the supervision of the big island drug court. [11] The Department of Health’s role has been to provide screening and assessments of possible eligible participants for the program, including forensic mental health consultation and coordination. [10] The Department of Health requests a 1.0 FTE Clinical Psychologist at a cost of $145,000 (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt) and a 1.0 FTE Social Worker/Human Services Professional IV at a cost of $76,788 (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt).

  "economic_impact": "The goal of the pilot program is diverting participants from incarceration, supporting their success in the community, and reducing recidivism. [11] The cost of incarceration of just one person for three years is $277,035.10 (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt), meaning if the program helps keep just six women out of prison, the program will have already paid for itself. [10] [10] Establishing a permanent Women's Court in the First Circuit and a pilot program in the Third Circuit will help reduce recidivism by providing trauma‑informed, gender-responsive treatment programs for incarcerated women in the State. [12]",
