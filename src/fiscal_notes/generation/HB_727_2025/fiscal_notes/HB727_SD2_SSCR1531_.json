  "overview": "The purpose of this Act is to make the women's court pilot program in the first circuit permanent and establish a three-year women's court pilot program in the circuit court of the Kona division of the third circuit. [11] The pilot program is intended to acknowledge the distinct pathways that lead women into the criminal justice system and address their individualized needs. [11] Part III of the Act, which establishes the pilot program, shall be repealed on June 30, 2028. [11]",
  "appropriations": "There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii an unspecified sum for fiscal year 2025-2026 and an unspecified sum for fiscal year 2026-2027 for mental health, substance abuse treatment, and other services. [11] The appropriation is also for the establishment of two temporary positions: one full-time equivalent (1.0 FTE) Kona drug court probation supervisor position and one full-time equivalent (1.0 FTE) peer specialist position. [11] The Department of Health requests a separate budget of $221,788 (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt) to support the Kona division pilot project, which includes $145,000 (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt) for a 1.0 FTE Clinical Psychologist and $76,788 (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt) for a 1.0 FTE Social Worker/Human Services Professional IV. [10] [10]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The proposal for the Kona Women’s Court (“KWC”) program is a 3-year pilot project under the umbrella of the well-established Big Island Drug Court (“BIDC”). [10] By developing KWC under the pre-existing drug court program, the KWC pilot project will use the established structures of drug court as its “backbone”. [10] A Judiciary proposal estimates the cost for a three-year pilot project would be $514,000 (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt) for fiscal year 2025-2026, $547,000 (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt) for fiscal year 2026-2027, and $515,000 (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt) for fiscal year 2027-2028. [10] This cost is justified by comparing it to the cost of incarceration, which for one person for three years is $277,035.10 (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt). [10]",
  "agency_impact": "There shall be established within the third circuit Kona division of the judiciary the women's court pilot program, which shall be under the supervision of the big island drug court. [11] The Judiciary is appropriated funds for two temporary positions: a Kona drug court probation supervisor (1.0 FTE) and a peer specialist (1.0 FTE). [11] The Department of Health's role has been to provide screening and assessments of possible eligible participants for the program, and it requests a budget of $221,788 (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt) to support the pilot project. [10] [10]",
  "economic_impact": "The pilot program's goal is diverting participants from incarceration, supporting their success in the community, and reducing recidivism. [11] The cost of incarceration of just one person for three years is $277,035.10 (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt), which means that if the program helps keep just six women out of prison, it will have already paid for itself. [10] [10] This focused approach ensures that justice-involved women are given an opportunity to rebuild their lives, contributing positively to society rather than being trapped in cycles of crime and incarceration. [10]",
  "policy_impact": "This measure makes the Women's Court pilot program in the First Circuit permanent by amending Act 243, Session Laws of Hawaii 2022, to remove its repeal date. [11] It establishes a new, temporary three-year Women's Court pilot program in the circuit court of the Kona division of the Third Circuit under the supervision of the big island drug court. [11] The Judiciary is also required to submit a report to the legislature regarding the need for and the associated costs of a pilot program for women's court in the second and fifth circuits and Hilo division of the third circuit. [11] [11]",
  "revenue_sources": "The bill appropriates funds out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii. [11] The sums appropriated shall be expended by the judiciary for the purposes of this Act. [11] No other revenue sources are specified in the provided documents. [11]",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "This measure makes the Women's Court Pilot Program in the First Circuit permanent, which will have ongoing fiscal implications beyond the six-year outlook, though no specific costs are appropriated for this purpose in the bill. [12] For the new three-year pilot program in the Kona division of the Third Circuit, the bill appropriates an unspecified sum for FY 2025-2026 and FY 2026-2027. [11] The Judiciary's testimony details a proposed three-year budget for the pilot project totaling $1,576,900 (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt). [10] The year-by-year breakdown is $514,900 (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt) for FY 2025-2026, $547,000 (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt) for FY 2026-2027, and $515,000 (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt) for FY 2027-2028. [10] The appropriation is for services and two temporary positions: a 1.0 FTE Kona drug court probation supervisor and a 1.0 FTE peer specialist. [11] The Judiciary's proposal seeks additional funding for services including a Women's Mental Health Professional at an annual cost of $175,000 (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt), Womens Behavioral Health Beds at $100,000 (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt) annually, and a Cultural Practitioner and Advisor at $30,000 (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt) annually. [10] [10] Training costs are estimated at $5,000 (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt) in year one and $42,000 (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt) in year two. [10] [10] The Department of Health also requests $221,788 (HB727_SD2_SSCR1531_.htm.txt) to support the Kona pilot program. [12] The pilot program in the Third Circuit is set to be repealed on June 30, 2028. [11]",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The provided documents do not describe any anticipated impacts on operating revenues. [11] The measure is funded by an appropriation from the general revenues of the State of Hawaii. [11] There is no indication that the program is intended to generate revenue. [11]",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The Judiciary's testimony requests funding for technology to support program operations, totaling $4,900 (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt). [10] This includes a computer workstation for $1,200 (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt), a computer for the Kona Probation Supervisor for $1,000 (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt), a printer for $1,000 (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt), a cellphone for $500 (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt), and a laptop for work in rural communities for $1,200 (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt). [10] [10] No other capital expenditures are specified. [11]",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "Making the women's court pilot program in the first circuit permanent will create ongoing fiscal obligations for that program beyond the six-year outlook. [11] The pilot program established in the Third Circuit is temporary, as Part III of the Act is repealed on June 30, 2028. [11] Any long-term fiscal implications for a Women's Court in the Third Circuit would be contingent on future legislation based on the findings and recommendations from the pilot program's required reports. [11]",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The most significant update from the previous fiscal note is the change in appropriations for the Third Circuit pilot program. [12] The current version of the bill has amended the appropriation amounts to be unspecified sums for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027. [11] The Committee on Ways and Means report states this change was made to facilitate further discussion on the measure. [12] While the core purpose of the bill remains the same, this version removes the specific dollar figures that were present in the previous iteration, leaving the funding level for the Judiciary's pilot program undetermined within the bill text itself.
