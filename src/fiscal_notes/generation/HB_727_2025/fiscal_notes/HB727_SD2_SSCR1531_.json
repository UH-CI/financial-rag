  "overview": "The Judiciary's proposal for the Kona Women’s Court pilot project has been updated from a two-year to a \"three-year pilot project\" (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt). The purpose remains to make the First Circuit's Women's Court permanent and establish a pilot in the Third Circuit's Kona division (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt). The Judiciary requests modifications to appropriations to ensure the pilot is \"fully funded through fiscal year 2027-2028\" (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt).",
  "appropriations": "The Committee on Ways and Means has \"amended this measure by changing the appropriations to unspecified amounts to facilitate further discussion on the measure\" (HB727_SD2). This replaces the specific amounts listed in the previous version of the bill. The Department of Health also submitted a request for a budget of \"$221,788 (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt) to support the Kona division pilot project,\" which includes funding for a Clinical Psychologist and a Social Worker (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt).",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The Judiciary's proposal has been updated from a two-year pilot project to a \"three-year pilot project\" to reflect the current version of the bill (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt). The financial projections are now based on a three-year timeline with a total requested budget of just over \"$1.50 (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt) million\" (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt). The assumption is that this investment will result in cost savings, as it is anticipated the program will help more than six women avoid incarceration (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt).",
  "agency_impact": "The Department of Health has submitted testimony requesting a budget of \"$221,788 (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt) to support the Kona division pilot project\" (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt). This funding is for two specific positions: a \"1.0 FTE Clinical Psychologist [$145,000] (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt) to provide forensic psychological consultation\" and a \"1.0 FTE Social Worker/Human Services Professional IV [$76,788] (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt) to conduct screenings and provide forensic coordination\" (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt). Your Committee notes that the Department of Health requests $221,788 (HB727_SD2) to support the Kona division pilot program.",
  "economic_impact": "The Judiciary testimony provides a new cost-benefit analysis, stating that the \"cost of incarceration of just one person for three years is $277,035.10 (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt)\" (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt). Based on this figure, the testimony projects that \"if KWC helps keep just six (6) women out of prison, the program will have already paid for itself\" (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt). This suggests a significant potential for cost savings to the state by reducing incarceration rates (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt).",
