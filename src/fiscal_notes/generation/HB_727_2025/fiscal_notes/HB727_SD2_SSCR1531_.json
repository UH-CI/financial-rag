  "overview": "The purpose of this Act is to make the women's court pilot program in the first circuit permanent. [11] It also seeks to establish a three-year women's court pilot program in the circuit court of the Kona division of the third circuit. [11] Additionally, the bill requires the judiciary to submit a report to the legislature regarding the need for and the associated costs of a pilot program for women's court in other circuits. [11]",
  "appropriations": "This measure appropriates an unspecified sum out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii for fiscal year 2025-2026 and an unspecified sum for fiscal year 2026-2027. [11] The funds are for mental health, substance abuse treatment, and other services, as well as the establishment of two temporary positions. [11] The sums appropriated shall be expended by the judiciary. [11]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The provided documents do not specify the assumptions or methodology used to determine the necessary appropriation amounts, as the sums are left blank in the bill. [11] The goal of the pilot program is to divert participants from incarceration, support their success in the community, and reduce recidivism by implementing trauma-informed and evidence-based practices. [11] The services offered are intended to address areas such as trauma, family support, life-skills, and substance abuse treatment. [11]",
  "agency_impact": "The judiciary is tasked with making the women's court pilot program in the first circuit permanent. [11] It will also establish and supervise a new women's court pilot program within the third circuit Kona division. [11] The judiciary is also required to submit reports to the legislature regarding the new pilot program and the potential need for similar programs in other circuits. [11] [11]",
  "economic_impact": "The program aims to divert participants from incarceration, support their success in the community, and reduce recidivism. [11] It is intended to acknowledge the distinct pathways that lead women into the criminal justice system and address their individualized needs. [11] The legislature finds that women offenders face unique barriers to success after incarceration, including being primary caregivers, having lower educational attainment, and lacking stable work history. [11]",
  "policy_impact": "This Act makes the women's court pilot program in the first circuit permanent by amending Act 243, Session Laws of Hawaii 2022, to remove its repeal date. [11] It establishes a new, temporary three-year Women's Court Pilot Program within the Kona division of the Third Circuit. [11] [11] It also requires the judiciary to report on the need for and associated costs of a pilot program in the second and fifth circuits and the Hilo division of the third circuit. [11]",
  "revenue_sources": "The bill appropriates funds out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii. [11] The sums for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027 are unspecified in this version of the bill. [11] No other revenue sources are identified in the provided documents. [11]",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The measure appropriates an unspecified amount from general revenues for FY 2025-2026 and FY 2026-2027 for the Kona pilot program. [11] The Kona pilot is a three-year program, which suggests funding will also be needed in FY 2027-2028. [11] Part III of the Act, establishing the Kona pilot, is repealed on June 30, 2028. [11] The bill makes the first circuit's women's court pilot program permanent, creating an ongoing fiscal obligation that is not funded by this measure. [11] [11] The judiciary must submit a report before the 2026 session on the costs of potential pilot programs in other circuits. [11] Additionally, the judiciary is required to submit reports to the legislature prior to the 2026, 2027, and 2028 sessions on the status of the Kona pilot, which will inform future fiscal decisions. [11] The recommendations in these reports will address whether the program should continue, expand, or be discontinued. [11]",

  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "Part III of the act, establishing the women's court pilot program in the third circuit Kona division, is repealed on June 30, 2028, ending its fiscal obligations. [11] However, the measure makes the Women's Court Pilot Program in the First Circuit permanent, which will result in ongoing fiscal implications beyond the six-year period.

[11] The current version of the bill, HB727 SD2, leaves these appropriation amounts blank. [11] Other aspects of the bill, such as the creation of two temporary FTEs, the establishment of the Kona pilot program, making the first circuit program permanent, reporting requirements, the sunset date for the pilot, and the effective date, remain consistent with the details described in the previous fiscal note. [11] [11] [11]",
