  "overview": "This measure maintains its core purpose of making the First Circuit's Womenâ€™s Court pilot program permanent and establishing a new pilot program in the Kona division of the Third Circuit. However, the pilot program in the Third Circuit is now explicitly defined as a three-year project based on an updated Judiciary proposal. The requirement for the Judiciary to report on future expansion remains.",
  "appropriations": "A significant change has occurred, as the committee hearing determines that the specific appropriations for the program have been amended to unspecified amounts to facilitate further discussion (HB727_SD2). Concurrently, the Department of Health has submitted a new request for $221,788 (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_) to support the Kona pilot. This DOH request includes funding for a 1.0 FTE Clinical Psychologist at $145,000 (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_) and a 1.0 FTE Social Worker at $76,788 (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_).",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The financial projections are now based on a detailed three-year pilot program proposal from the Judiciary, replacing the previous two-year model. The total requested cost for this three-year pilot is $1,576,900 (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_). This updated methodology includes funding for new services like a Cultural Practitioner, Moral Reconation Therapy, and program evaluation, reflecting a more comprehensive approach to program implementation.",
  "agency_impact": "In addition to the previously noted impact on the Judiciary, the Department of Health now anticipates a direct operational impact. Testimony indicates the Department requires two new positions to support the Kona pilot: a 1.0 FTE Clinical Psychologist and a 1.0 FTE Social Worker/Human Services Professional. These positions would be responsible for providing forensic psychological consultation, mental health screenings, and case management for program participants.",

  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The fiscal outlook has been updated to reflect a three-year pilot program in the Third Circuit, with the Judiciary's testimony requesting appropriations of $514,900 (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_) for fiscal year 2025-2026, $547,000 (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_) for fiscal year 2026-2027, and $515,000 (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_) for fiscal year 2027-2028. This new model adds recurring annual costs for a Cultural Practitioner at $30,000 (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_), Moral Reconation Therapy at $25,000 (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_), and increased drug testing at $10,000 (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_). A one-time cost for program evaluation of $10,000 (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_) is included in the third year. Furthermore, the Department of Health's new testimony requests an additional recurring annual cost of $221,788 (HB727_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_) for two positions to support the pilot. Although these costs have been proposed, the appropriations in the current version of the bill are unspecified.",
