  "overview": "The Judiciary proposes amendments and modifications to this bill so that the pilot project can be successful in light of the unique structure of the Circuit Courts in the Third Circuit and the lack of availability of community-based mental health services on the Big Island. [5] [5] The Judiciary's proposal calls for the establishment of a Women’s Court program to operate in both Hilo and Kona, and to be supervised by BIDC. [5] Given the Third Circuit’s willingness to pilot this modified Women’s Court model, the Judiciary respectfully requests that the Second and Fifth Circuits be deleted from consideration for this pilot project. [5]",
  "appropriations": "The Department of Health requests a budget of $801,802 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_). [5] Each circuit would require a 1.0 FTE Clinical Psychologist at $145,000 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_), a 1.0 FTE Social Worker/Human Services Professional IV at $76,788 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_), and a 1.0 FTE Social Services Assistant V at $45,216 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_) to provide peer support. [5]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The Judiciary's proposal calls for the program to operate as a separate program under the supervision of Big Island Drug Court (“BIDC”). [5] By situating BIWC under the supervision of BIDC with other treatment court programs, the existing BIDC structure and staff can be leveraged at the outset. [5] The proposal calls for all twenty-five (25) of the women currently participating in the BIDC program to be screened for eligibility for the BIWC program to allow the program to begin providing services to the target population immediately. [5]",
  "agency_impact": "In order to successfully implement a Big Island Women’s Court (BIWC) program, the Judiciary states the bill would need to be modified to provide for sufficient funding and staff to operate the program in both the Hilo and Kona courthouses. [5] The Judiciary's proposal for a BIWC has a strong focus on the development of mental health services, with the hiring of full-time equivalent providers, funding for the creation of new services, and training for program staff. [5] The Third Circuit and BIDC stand ready to assist, as long as they have the requested mental health professionals on contract or hired by the Judiciary, along with additional staff members to be hired by BIDC. [5]",

  "policy_impact": "The Judiciary proposes amendments to this measure that would establish the Women’s Court pilot project in the Third Circuit, rather than the Second and Fifth Circuits as currently written. [5] The Judiciary's proposal calls for the program to operate as a separate program under the supervision of Big Island Drug Court (“BIDC”), leveraging the structure of other successful treatment court programs currently offered in the Third Circuit. [5] [5] The Judiciary also suggests that if discussions on its proposal are not feasible, the Legislature could direct the Third Circuit and the BIDC to conduct an interim study to establish an updated proposal for the program for the next legislative session.

  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "To successfully implement a Big Island Women’s Court (BIWC) program, the bill would need to provide for sufficient funding and staff to operate the program in both the Hilo and Kona courthouses. [5] A truly trauma-informed approach to this program will require extensive mental health counseling by trained psychologists, psychiatrists, and/or mental health counselors. [5] The Department of Health's testimony requests a budget of $801,802 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_), based on staffing requirements for the existing First Circuit pilot project. [5] For each pilot circuit, the DOH would require a 1.0 FTE Clinical Psychologist at a cost of $145,000 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_), a 1.0 FTE Social Worker/Human Services Professional IV at $76,788 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_), and a 1.0 FTE Social Services Assistant V at $45,216 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_). [5] The pilot program is intended to sunset on 6/30/2028. [5]",

  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The Judiciary now proposes significant amendments to the measure, requesting that the pilot program be established in the Third Circuit instead of the Second and Fifth Circuits. [5] It details a specific implementation model where the program would operate under the Big Island Drug Court (BIDC) and would screen the twenty-five (25) women currently in the BIDC program for immediate eligibility. [5] [5] New testimony from the Department of Health provides a specific per-circuit cost breakdown for three FTE positions needed for the pilot, including a Clinical Psychologist ($145,000), a Social Worker ($76,788), and a Social Services Assistant ($45,216). [5] The Judiciary's testimony newly emphasizes significant barriers to success on Hawaiʻi Island, including the unique geography with courthouses 100 miles apart and a severe lack of community-based mental health providers.
