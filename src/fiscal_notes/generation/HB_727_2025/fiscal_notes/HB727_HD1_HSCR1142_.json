  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The Judiciary's testimony proposes a modified implementation model for a Big Island Women’s Court (BIWC) program due to the \"lack of availability of community-based mental health services on the Big Island (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_)\". The proposal suggests the program should \"operate as a separate program under the supervision of Big Island Drug Court (“BIDC”) (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_)\". This structure is intended to leverage \"the existing BIDC structure and staff\" to \"maximize existing resources (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_)\".",
  "agency_impact": "The Judiciary testified in support of establishing the pilot project in the Third Circuit and requested modifications to the bill, proposing \"that the Second and Fifth Circuits be deleted from consideration for this pilot project (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_)\". Their proposal calls for the Big Island Women’s Court program \"to operate in both Hilo and Kona, and to be supervised by BIDC (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_)\". In testimony regarding the existing First Circuit pilot program, the Department of Health stated that in 2024 it \"conducted 33 mental health screenings and 24 psychological assessments of participants for the program (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_)\".",
  "economic_impact": "A new proposal from the Third Circuit \"calls for all twenty-five (25) of the women currently participating in the BIDC program to be screened for eligibility for the BIWC program (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_)\". This would \"allow the program to begin providing services to the target population immediately (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_)\". The Department of the Prosecuting Attorney for Maui County supports the bill as it would \"provide a needed alternative to incarceration for women within the second circuit (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_)\".",
  "policy_impact": "The Judiciary has proposed significant amendments to the bill's policy, asking that the pilot program be established in the Third Circuit and requesting \"that the Second and Fifth Circuits be deleted from consideration for this pilot project (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_)\". This represents a reversal of the current bill's structure, which mandates the pilot in the Second and Fifth circuits and a study for the Third. As an alternative, the Judiciary suggested the legislature could \"direct the Third Circuit and the BIDC to conduct an interim study to establish an updated proposal for the program (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_)\".",

  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The Judiciary has shifted its position, now formally proposing in testimony to establish the pilot program in the Third Circuit and requesting \"that the Second and Fifth Circuits be deleted from consideration for this pilot project (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_)\". The Judiciary's proposed methodology for a Third Circuit program has been updated to operate \"under the supervision of Big Island Drug Court (“BIDC”) (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_)\" to leverage existing resources. The number of potential participants for a Third Circuit pilot has changed, as the Judiciary's proposal now \"calls for all twenty-five (25) (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_)\" women in the Big Island Drug Court program to be screened for eligibility."
