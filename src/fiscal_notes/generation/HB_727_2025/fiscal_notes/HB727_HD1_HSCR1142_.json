  "overview": "This measure establishes a temporary three-year women's court pilot program within the Second and Fifth Circuits. [5] It also requires the Third Circuit of the Judiciary and Big Island Drug Court to conduct an interim study to establish a blueprint for a women's court pilot program in the Third Circuit. [5] The Judiciary supports the intent of the measure but proposes amendments for a modified pilot project in the Third Circuit, citing the unique structure of its courts and lack of community-based mental health services on the Big Island. [5] [5]",
  "appropriations": "The Department of Health requests a budget of $801,802 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_.PDF.txt), which is based on the Department’s staffing requirements for the operation of the existing Women’s Court pilot project of the First Circuit. [5] Each circuit would require a 1.0 FTE Clinical Psychologist, 1.0 FTE Social Worker/Human Services Professional IV, and 1.0 FTE Social Services Assistant V. [5] [5] The Judiciary testimony states that to be successful, the Big Island Women's Court will require sufficient funding and positions, including the hiring of full-time equivalent providers and funding for the creation of new services. [5] [5]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The Judiciary's proposal for a Big Island Women's Court assumes the program would operate in both Hilo and Kona under the supervision of the Big Island Drug Court (BIDC). [5] This structure would leverage existing BIDC staff and allow for immediate service provision by screening the twenty-five women currently participating in the BIDC program for eligibility. [5] [5] The Department of Health's budget request is based on the staffing requirements for the existing Women's Court pilot project of the First Circuit. [5]",
  "agency_impact": "The Judiciary proposes operating the Big Island Women's Court as a separate division of the Big Island Drug Court, similar to the Veteran's Treatment Court and Juvenile Treatment Court programs. [5] This would involve leveraging existing BIDC structure and staff while supplementing services with additional resources. [5] [5] In 2024, for the First Circuit's Mohala Wahine program, the Department of Health conducted 33 mental health screenings and 24 psychological assessments of participants. [5] [5]",
  "economic_impact": "The intent of the project is to divert participants from incarceration, support their success in the community, and reduce recidivism. [5] Expansion to other circuits would allow the program to assist more women in need and divert them away from incarceration. [5] Substance use disorder treatment helps break the cycle of addiction and recidivism, and offenders who receive effective treatment are more likely to develop coping skills and lead crime-free lives after release. [5] [5]",
  "policy_impact": "The Judiciary proposes amendments and modifications to the bill, including a request that the Second and Fifth Circuits be deleted from consideration for this pilot project. [5] [5] Instead, the Judiciary proposes a modified Women's Court model for the Third Circuit, given its willingness to pilot it. [5] This proposal is based on the unique structure of the Circuit Courts in the Third Circuit and the lack of available community-based mental health services on the Big Island. [5]",

[5] For each circuit, this includes 1.0 FTE Clinical Psychologist at $145,000 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_.PDF.txt), 1.0 FTE Social Worker/Human Services Professional IV at $76,788 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_.PDF.txt), and 1.0 FTE Social Services Assistant V at $45,216 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_.PDF.txt). [5] [5] The Judiciary's proposal for a Big Island Women's Court would require sufficient funding for positions and direct services, which are otherwise unavailable on the Big Island. [5] [5] [5] The proposal has a strong focus on the development of mental health services, with the hiring of full-time equivalent providers, funding for the creation of new services, and training for program staff. [5] [5] A truly trauma-informed approach would require extensive mental health counseling by trained psychologists, psychiatrists, and/or mental health counselors. [5] The Third Circuit and Big Island Drug Court stand ready to assist as long as they have the requested mental health professionals on contract or hired by the Judiciary, along with additional staff members to be hired by BIDC. [5] [5] The bill has a sunset date of June 30, 2028. [5]",

  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The Judiciary submitted testimony proposing significant amendments, including deleting the Second and Fifth Circuits from the pilot program and instead implementing a modified pilot exclusively in the Third Circuit.

[5] [5] New testimony from the Department of Health provided 2024 workload statistics from the First Circuit program, where it conducted 33 mental health screenings and 24 psychological assessments.
