  "overview": "This measure establishes a temporary three-year women's court pilot program within the Second and Fifth Circuits and requires the Third Circuit of the Judiciary and Big Island Drug Court to conduct an interim study. [5] [5] The Judiciary supports the intent of the measure but proposes amendments, requesting that the Second and Fifth Circuits be deleted from consideration for the pilot project and that a modified pilot be established in the Third Circuit instead. [5] [5] The measure sunsets on June 30, 2028. [5]",
  "appropriations": "The Department of Health requests a budget of $801,802 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_.PDF.txt), which is based on the Department’s staffing requirements for the operation of the existing Women’s Court pilot project of the First Circuit. [CHUNK_48, NUMBER_0] The testimony specifies that each circuit would require funding for a 1.0 FTE Clinical Psychologist at $145,000 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_.PDF.txt), a 1.0 FTE Social Worker/Human Services Professional IV at $76,788 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_.PDF.txt), and a 1.0 FTE Social Services Assistant V at $45,216 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_.PDF.txt). [CHUNK_49, NUMBER_1, NUMBER_2, NUMBER_3] The Judiciary also requests sufficient funding and staff to operate a proposed program in both the Hilo and Kona courthouses. [5]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The Department of Health's budget request is based on the staffing requirements from the operational Mohala Wahine women's court pilot project in the First Circuit. [5] [5] The Judiciary's proposal for a modified Big Island Women's Court (BIWC) is based on the unique structure of the Third Circuit, which has dual-docket courts and two main courthouses located 100 miles apart in Hilo and Kona. [5] [5] The proposal for the Third Circuit also accounts for the severe deficiency of community-based mental health services on Hawaiʻi Island, which necessitates hiring direct-provider positions. [5] [5]",
  "agency_impact": "The Judiciary testified that due to the geography and structure of the Third Circuit, it has never been practical to have stand-alone specialty courts as in the First Circuit. [5] It proposes that a Big Island Women’s Court program operate in both Hilo and Kona under the supervision of the Big Island Drug Court (“BIDC”) to leverage existing staff and structure. [5] [5] The Department of Health noted that in 2024, its collaborative partnership with the Judiciary on the First Circuit's pilot program involved conducting 33 mental health screenings and 24 psychological assessments of participants. [5] [5]",
  "economic_impact": "The goal of the project is to divert participants from incarceration, support their success in the community, and reduce recidivism. [5] Expansion to other circuits would allow the program to assist more women in need and divert them away from incarceration. [5] This focused approach ensures that justice-involved women are given an opportunity to rebuild their lives, contributing positively to society rather than being trapped in cycles of crime and incarceration. [5]",
  "policy_impact": "The Judiciary has proposed significant modifications to the measure, requesting that the Second and Fifth Circuits be deleted from consideration for the pilot project. [5] Instead, the Judiciary proposes implementing a modified pilot program in the Third Circuit that would operate under the supervision of the Big Island Drug Court. [5] [5] Despite this testimony, the Committee on Finance recommended that the bill pass Third Reading in its current form, which establishes the pilot program in the Second and Fifth Circuits and a study in the Third Circuit.

[5] [CHUNK_48, NUMBER_0] For each circuit, this includes funding for a 1.0 FTE Clinical Psychologist at $145,000 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_.PDF.txt), a 1.0 FTE Social Worker/Human Services Professional IV at $76,788 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_.PDF.txt), and a 1.0 FTE Social Services Assistant V at $45,216 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_.PDF.txt). [CHUNK_49, NUMBER_1, NUMBER_2, NUMBER_3] The Judiciary's testimony requests modifications for sufficient funding and staff to operate its proposed program in both Hilo and Kona.
