  "overview": "",
  "appropriations": "The Department of Health's testimony requests a budget of $801,802 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_) for each circuit involved in the pilot program. This funding would support 1.0 FTE Clinical Psychologist at $145,000 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_), 1.0 FTE Social Worker at $76,788 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_), and 1.0 FTE Social Services Assistant at $45,216 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_) per circuit. This clarifies that the total appropriation needed for the Department of Health to support the two pilot circuits would be double the amount previously understood.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The Department of Health has clarified that its cost estimation methodology is based on the staffing requirements for the existing First Circuit pilot program, applied individually to each new proposed circuit. The total requested budget of $801,802 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_) is therefore a per-circuit cost. The Judiciary's testimony notes that a different resource model would be needed for the Third Circuit, requiring direct-provider positions and funding for direct services due to the lack of community-based mental health providers.",
  "agency_impact": "The Judiciary's testimony proposes a significant modification, requesting the pilot program be located in the Third Circuit instead of the Second and Fifth Circuits. They suggest the program operate under the supervision of the Big Island Drug Court to serve both Hilo and Kona, leveraging existing structures but requiring additional staff and direct-provider positions. This represents a different implementation strategy than the one outlined in the bill, indicating potential operational challenges.",
  "economic_impact": "Testimony emphasizes that gender-responsive courts address the root causes of criminal behavior, such as trauma and substance abuse, which can break the cycle of addiction and recidivism (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_). The program aims to divert women from incarceration, which can lead to long-term cost savings for the state and allow participants to rebuild their lives and contribute positively to society (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_). The success of the First Circuit's Mohala Wahine program is cited as evidence of the potential for positive outcomes (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_).",
  "policy_impact": "The Judiciary's testimony introduces a significant policy consideration by formally requesting that the pilot project be moved to the Third Circuit, citing unique geographical and service-availability issues on Hawaiʻi Island (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_). This suggests that a one-size-fits-all approach to expanding specialty courts may not be feasible for neighbor islands. The testimony proposes an alternative model where the program is integrated into the existing Big Island Drug Court structure rather than being a stand-alone court (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_).",
  "revenue_sources": "",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The fiscal outlook for the three-year pilot program has been clarified, with the Department of Health requesting $801,802 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_) annually for each of the two proposed pilot circuits (Second and Fifth). This would result in a total recurring annual cost of approximately $1,603,604 to the Department of Health for the duration of the pilot, a significant increase from the previously noted single appropriation. The Judiciary's testimony highlights additional fiscal needs if their alternative proposal for a Third Circuit pilot is adopted. These needs include funding for staff to operate in both Hilo and Kona, as well as funding for direct mental health services and provider positions to compensate for the lack of community-based resources on Hawaiʻi Island (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_). The costs associated with the Third Circuit's interim study remain unspecified.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The Judiciary’s testimony indicates that a significant challenge for a permanent program, particularly on Hawaiʻi Island, is the severe deficiency of community-based mental health services (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_). Therefore, long-term fiscal obligations would likely include sustained funding for direct-provider positions and services hired by the Judiciary. These costs would be in addition to the operational expenses of the court program itself.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The Department of Health has clarified that its requested budget of $801,802 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_) is per circuit, which would double the estimated cost for the two-circuit pilot program. The Judiciary has formally proposed an alternative plan, requesting the pilot be moved from the Second and Fifth Circuits to the Third Circuit to be operated under the Big Island Drug Court, citing unique geographical and resource challenges (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_). This testimony introduces a need for direct funding for mental health provider positions on Hawaiʻi Island, highlighting a potential long-term fiscal implication not previously detailed."
