[5] It also requires the third circuit of the Judiciary and Big Island Drug Court to conduct an interim study.

[CHUNK_49, CHUNK_50, NUMBER_1, NUMBER_2, NUMBER_3] The Judiciary notes that a successful program on the Big Island would require sufficient funding and positions.

[CHUNK_48, CHUNK_49, CHUNK_50, NUMBER_0] A significant policy update comes from the Judiciary, which testified with a request to delete the Second and Fifth Circuits from the pilot project and instead implement a modified pilot model within the Third Circuit. [5] This proposal is a notable departure from the bill's current language, which assigns the Third Circuit an interim study.
