  "overview": "This measure establishes a temporary three-year women's court pilot program within the Second and Fifth Circuits. [5] It also requires the Third Circuit of the Judiciary and Big Island Drug Court to conduct an interim study to establish a blueprint for a women's court pilot program in the Third Circuit. [5] The program is intended to acknowledge the distinct pathways that lead women into the criminal justice system and address their individualized needs. [6]",
  "appropriations": "The bill appropriates funds and establishes temporary positions. [5] The Department of Health requests a budget of $801,802 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_.PDF.txt) based on staffing requirements for the operation of the existing Women’s Court pilot project of the First Circuit. [5] This budget would cover a 1.0 FTE Clinical Psychologist at $145,000 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_.PDF.txt), a 1.0 FTE Social Worker/Human Services Professional IV at $76,788 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_.PDF.txt), and a 1.0 FTE Social Services Assistant V at $45,216 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_.PDF.txt) for each circuit. [5]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The Department of Health's request for a budget of $801,802 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_.PDF.txt) is based on the Department’s staffing requirements for the operation of the existing Women’s Court pilot project of the First Circuit. [5] It is assumed that each circuit would require a full-time clinical psychologist, social worker, and social services assistant. [5] The Judiciary notes that circumstances on the neighbor islands may warrant different implementation and different resource requirements. [5]",
  "agency_impact": "The Judiciary supports the intent of the measure but proposes amendments and modifications so that the pilot project can be successful in the Third Circuit. [5] The Judiciary's proposal calls for a Big Island Women's Court (BIWC) program to operate in both Hilo and Kona under the supervision of the Big Island Drug Court. [5] The Department of Health requests funding to expand services, including staff support, to implement the program. [5]",
  "economic_impact": "The intent of the project is to divert participants from incarceration, support their success in the community, and reduce recidivism. [5] Expansion to the other circuits would allow the program to assist more women in need and divert them away from incarceration. [5] Gender-responsive women’s courts are effective because they address the unique needs and challenges women face, such as trauma, substance use disorder, and mental illness. [5]",
  "policy_impact": "The Judiciary proposes amendments to the bill, including sufficient funding and staff to operate in both Hilo and Kona and to operate as a separate program under the supervision of Big Island Drug Court (“BIDC”). [5] Given the Third Circuit’s willingness to pilot a modified Women’s Court model, the Judiciary respectfully requests that the Second and Fifth Circuits be deleted from consideration for this pilot project. [5] The current measure, however, establishes the pilot in the Second and Fifth Circuits while requiring an interim study for the Third Circuit. [5]",
  "revenue_sources": "This measure appropriates funds. [5] The Department of Health requests that funding for this measure be considered as a vehicle to expand services, provided it does not supplant the requests outlined in the Governor's executive budget request. [5] The provided documents do not specify the source of the appropriations, such as general revenues or special funds. [5]",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The measure establishes a temporary three-year women's court pilot program in the Second and Fifth Circuits which sunsets on June 30, 2028. [5] [5] It also requires the Third Circuit to conduct an interim study to establish a blueprint for a women's court pilot program there. [5] The Department of Health requests a budget of $801,802 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_.PDF.txt) based on its staffing requirements for the existing First Circuit pilot project. [5] This funding would cover staffing for each circuit, including a 1.0 FTE Clinical Psychologist at $145,000 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_.PDF.txt), a 1.0 FTE Social Worker/Human Services Professional IV at $76,788 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_.PDF.txt), and a 1.0 FTE Social Services Assistant V at $45,216 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_.PDF.txt). [5] The Judiciary notes that to be successful, the Big Island Women's Court will require sufficient funding and positions. [5] The Third Circuit and the BIDC could be directed to conduct an interim study to establish an updated proposal setting forth additional information regarding the resource requirements for the program, to be submitted for the next legislative session. [5] This measure establishes temporary positions and appropriates funds, but the total amount is not specified in the bill. [5]",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The provided documents do not describe any anticipated impacts on operating revenues. [5] The program is supported by appropriations, and there is no indication that it will generate its own revenue stream. [5] The Department of Health requests funding for this measure to expand services. [5]",
  "Full_Time_Equivalent_Positions": "The Department of Health testimony requests the following temporary positions for each circuit: 1.0 FTE Clinical Psychologist at a cost of $145,000 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_.PDF.txt) to conduct psychological assessments. [5] It also requests 1.0 FTE Social Worker/Human Services Professional IV at $76,788 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_.PDF.txt) to conduct screenings. [5] Additionally, testimony requests 1.0 FTE Social Services Assistant V at $45,216 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_.PDF.txt) to provide peer support. [5]",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The provided documents do not outline any specific capital expenditures for this measure. [5] The focus of the fiscal implications is on staffing and services rather than investments in facilities or major equipment. [5] The Judiciary's testimony mentions a need for funding and staff but does not detail capital costs. [5]",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The bill contains a sunset clause and is set to be repealed on June 30, 2028. [5] The Judiciary is required to submit reports on the pilot program. [5] Any fiscal implications beyond the three-year pilot period would depend on future legislative action to make the program permanent or expand it. [5]",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The new information includes detailed testimony from the Judiciary proposing significant modifications to the bill. [5] The Judiciary outlines a specific proposal for a Big Island Women’s Court (BIWC) to operate in both Hilo and Kona under the supervision of the Big Island Drug Court, citing the unique geography and lack of mental health services on the island. [5] [5] Based on this alternative proposal, the Judiciary requests that the Second and Fifth Circuits be deleted from consideration for the pilot project. [5] Additionally, the Department of Health's request for $801,802 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_.PDF.txt) is now supported by direct testimony to the Committee on Finance, reinforcing the fiscal need previously identified in a committee report.
