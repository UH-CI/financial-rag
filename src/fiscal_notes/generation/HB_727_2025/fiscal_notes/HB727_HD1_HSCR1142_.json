  "overview": "This measure establishes a temporary three-year women's court pilot program within the Second and Fifth Circuits. [5] The purpose of the measure is to acknowledge the distinct pathways that lead women into the criminal justice system and address their individualized needs. [6] The bill also requires the Third Circuit of the Judiciary and Big Island Drug Court to conduct an interim study to establish a blueprint for a women's court pilot program in the Third Circuit, requires reports, establishes temporary positions, appropriates funds, and sunsets on 6/30/2028. [5]",
  "appropriations": "The Department of Health requests a budget of $801,802 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_.PDF.txt), which is based on the Department’s staffing requirements for the operation of the existing Women’s Court pilot project of the First Circuit. [5] The testimony indicates each circuit would require a 1.0 FTE Clinical Psychologist for $145,000 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_.PDF.txt) to conduct psychological assessments, a 1.0 FTE Social Worker/Human Services Professional IV for $76,788 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_.PDF.txt) to conduct screenings, and a 1.0 FTE Social Services Assistant V for $45,216 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_.PDF.txt) to provide peer support. [5] [5] The Office of the Public Defender is supportive of any appropriations as deemed necessary. [5]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The Department of Health's budget request of $801,802 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_.PDF.txt) is based on the Department’s staffing requirements for the operation of the existing Women’s Court pilot project of the First Circuit. [5] The Judiciary's proposal for the Third Circuit calls for the program to be supervised by the Big Island Drug Court (BIDC), leveraging the existing BIDC structure and staff. [5] [5] This model would allow the program to supplement existing services with additional resources provided by the bill, maximizing existing resources. [5]",
  "agency_impact": "The Judiciary supports the intent of the measure but proposes amendments, including a request that the Second and Fifth Circuits be deleted from consideration for this pilot project in favor of a modified model for the Third Circuit. [5] [5] The Department of Health supports the measure and notes that in 2024 it conducted 33 mental health screenings and 24 psychological assessments for the First Circuit program. [5] [5] [5] The Office of the Public Defender supports the bill and represents most of the participants in the existing program. [5] [5]",
  "economic_impact": "The goal of the project is diverting participants from incarceration, supporting their success in the community, and reducing recidivism. [5] Expansion to the other circuits would allow the program to assist more women in need and divert them away from incarceration. [5] This focused approach ensures that justice-involved women are given an opportunity to rebuild their lives, contributing positively to society rather than being trapped in cycles of crime and incarceration. [5]",
  "policy_impact": "This bill establishes a temporary three-year women's court pilot program in the Second and Fifth Circuits and requires the Third Circuit to conduct an interim study. [5] [5] The Judiciary proposes significant modifications, requesting that the pilot project be focused on the Third Circuit with a specific operational model supervised by the Big Island Drug Court (BIDC) due to the unique structure of the courts and lack of mental health services on the Big Island. [5] [5] [5] This proposal includes operating the program in both Hilo and Kona courthouses. [5]",
  "revenue_sources": "The measure appropriates funds. [5] The Department of Health requests funding for this measure to expand services, including staff support. [5] The provided documents do not specify the source of the appropriations, such as general revenues. [5] [5]",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The bill establishes a temporary three-year pilot program that sunsets on 6/30/2028. [5] [5] The Department of Health requests a budget of $801,802 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_.PDF.txt) for its staffing requirements. [5] Per-circuit staffing costs include a 1.0 FTE Clinical Psychologist at $145,000 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_.PDF.txt), a 1.0 FTE Social Worker at $76,788 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_.PDF.txt), and a 1.0 FTE Social Services Assistant at $45,216 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_.PDF.txt). [5] [5] The measure also requires the Third Circuit to conduct an interim study to establish a blueprint for a women's court pilot program, which will set forth additional information regarding resource requirements to be submitted for the next legislative session. [5] [5] [5] The bill requires reports and establishes temporary positions. [5] The Judiciary notes that a successful Big Island Women’s Court (BIWC) program would need sufficient funding and staff to operate in both Hilo and Kona. [5] [5]",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The provided legislative documents do not indicate any anticipated impact on operating revenues. [5] [5] The measure focuses on the appropriation of funds for program expenditures. [5] No revenue-generating mechanisms are proposed in the bill. [5]",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The provided testimony and committee reports for HB 727 H.D. 1 do not specify any capital expenditures. [5] [5] While the bill appropriates funds, there is no mention of these funds being allocated for equipment or other capital costs. [5] [5]",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The bill contains a sunset provision, and the pilot program is set to be repealed on 6/30/2028. [5] The measure requires the Judiciary to submit reports, which would likely inform any decision to continue or expand the program. [5] Any fiscal implications beyond the sunset date would be contingent on future legislation. [5]",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The new information is primarily from Judiciary testimony proposing significant changes to the bill's approach. [5] The Judiciary now requests that the Second and Fifth Circuits be deleted from consideration for the pilot project, instead advocating for a modified pilot in the Third Circuit to be supervised by the Big Island Drug Court. [5] This Judiciary proposal details a specific structure, including operations in both Hilo and Kona, to address the unique geography and lack of mental health services on Hawaiʻi Island. [5] [5] The Department of Health's testimony reiterates the same total funding request of $801,802 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_.PDF.txt) and staffing costs as previously noted, but provides this information in a new testimony to the House Finance Committee.
