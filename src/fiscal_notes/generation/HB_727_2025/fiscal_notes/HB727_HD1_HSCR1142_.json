  "overview": "This measure has been amended to establish a temporary three-year women's court pilot program in the Second and Fifth Circuits, rather than the Third Circuit. It now requires the Third Circuit Judiciary and the Big Island Drug Court to conduct an interim study to develop a blueprint for a future pilot program. The measure includes a sunset date of June 30, 2028, and no longer makes the First Circuit's program permanent.",
  "appropriations": "The previous appropriation for a Third Circuit pilot is no longer applicable. This measure requires new appropriations to fund the pilot programs in the Second and Fifth Circuits and the study in the Third Circuit. The Department of Health has requested a budget of $801,802 per pilot circuit to fund its staffing requirements for mental health services.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The financial methodology has shifted from a specific Third Circuit proposal to new projections for pilots in the Second and Fifth Circuits. Cost estimates are now based on comparable staffing models from the operational First Circuit program, as detailed in the Department of Health's request for one clinical psychologist, one social worker, and one social services assistant per circuit. The Judiciary's testimony indicates that program costs must also account for direct-provider positions due to the lack of community-based mental health services on neighbor islands.",
  "agency_impact": "The operational impact shifts from the Third Circuit to the Second and Fifth Circuits, which are now responsible for implementing the new pilot programs. The Third Circuit's role is reduced to conducting an interim study and submitting a report. The Department of Health anticipates a significant new impact, requiring the hiring of three full-time equivalent staff members in each pilot circuit to provide mental health screenings, assessments, and peer support.",
  "economic_impact": "The anticipated economic benefits of reducing recidivism and long-term incarceration costs now stem from the implementation of pilot programs in the Second and Fifth Circuits. Testimonies cite the success of the First Circuit's Mohala Wahine program as evidence that this gender-responsive model can divert women from the carceral system and support their successful reintegration into the community. The programs aim to break cycles of trauma and addiction, thereby reducing future costs to the justice system.",
  "policy_impact": "This measure alters the legislative strategy for statewide expansion of the Women's Court model, adopting a more phased approach. It prioritizes establishing pilot programs in the Second and Fifth Circuits while mandating a study for the Third Circuit to address its unique geographical and resource challenges before implementation. This change reflects a policy of adapting the program model to specific local conditions rather than a uniform rollout.",
  "revenue_sources": "",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The six-year fiscal outlook is completely revised to support a three-year pilot program in two circuits (Second and Fifth) from FY 2026 through FY 2028, after which the program sunsets. Annual costs will need to cover Judiciary operations and service contracts in two circuits, plus staffing at other agencies. The Department of Health alone estimates annual costs of $1,603,604 ($801,802 per circuit) for its support staff. Additional costs for the Judiciary to run the courts and contract for services are not specified but would be substantial. A smaller, one-time cost for the Third Circuit's interim study would be incurred in FY 2026. If the pilots are made permanent after FY 2028, these annual costs would become a recurring part of the state budget.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The specific capital expenditure identified for the Third Circuit is no longer relevant. While establishing new programs in the Second and Fifth Circuits will likely require one-time capital expenditures for technology and equipment, no specific amounts are detailed in the current measure or supporting documents.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "If the pilot programs in the Second and Fifth Circuits are made permanent following the June 30, 2028 sunset date, the state will incur a significant ongoing fiscal obligation to fund operations in two judicial circuits. This would include recurring annual costs for Judiciary staffing, service contracts, and support positions at the Department of Health, likely exceeding $1.6 million per year plus Judiciary operational expenses. Long-term sustainability would depend on continued general fund appropriations.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The measure's focus has fundamentally shifted from making the First Circuit program permanent and piloting in the Third Circuit to establishing temporary three-year pilots in the Second and Fifth Circuits. Consequently, the Third Circuit's role has been changed from implementation to conducting an interim study to address local challenges. All associated appropriations and fiscal implications have been revised, with new cost estimates based on staffing needs in the Second and Fifth Circuits, including a Department of Health request for $801,802 per pilot circuit."
