  "overview": "The measure has been amended to change the duration of the Women's Court Pilot Program in the Kona division of the Third Circuit from three years to two years. The pilot program will now sunset on June 30, 2027 (HB727_CD1). Additionally, the requirement for the Judiciary to submit a report on the costs of expanding the program to other circuits has been deleted.",
  "appropriations": "Specific funding has now been established for the Kona pilot program. The committee hearing determines an appropriation of $514,900 (HB727_CD1) for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 (HB727_CD1) for fiscal year 2026-2027. These funds are allocated for mental health, substance abuse treatment, services, equipment, and the creation of one temporary Kona drug court probation supervisor position.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The financial projections are now based on a two-year pilot program model, replacing the previous three-year assumption. The cost basis has also shifted, as the Judiciary is now designated as the provider for mental health services. This change removes the Department of Health's previously requested funding from the fiscal calculation.",
  "agency_impact": "The operational impact has shifted, as the Judiciary is now explicitly responsible for providing mental health services for the Kona pilot program, a duty previously anticipated for the Department of Health. The Judiciary will also be responsible for establishing and managing one new full-time equivalent temporary Kona drug court probation supervisor position (HB727_CD1). The previously anticipated impact on the Department of Health, including its request for new positions, is no longer applicable under this version of the measure.",
  "economic_impact": "",
  "policy_impact": "A significant policy change is the codification of the Women's Court Program in the First Circuit within the Hawaii Revised Statutes, which formally establishes it as a permanent program rather than one existing under session laws (HB727_CD1). Furthermore, the legislative directive has been narrowed by deleting the requirement for the Judiciary to report on the potential expansion of the Women's Court to other circuits. This removes the mandate for a statewide feasibility study.",
  "revenue_sources": "",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The fiscal outlook is now based on a two-year pilot program in the Third Circuit, with a sunset date of June 30, 2027 (HB727_CD1). The committee hearing determines appropriations of $514,900 (HB727_CD1) for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 (HB727_CD1) for fiscal year 2026-2027. These funds will support one temporary full-time equivalent probation supervisor position and associated costs for mental health and substance abuse treatment services. There are no further appropriations specified for this pilot program in subsequent years, as it is scheduled to terminate.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The Kona pilot program is scheduled to sunset on June 30, 2027 (HB727_CD1), so there are no ongoing fiscal obligations for it after the initial two-year period unless further legislative action is taken. However, because the First Circuit's Women's Court is now being made a permanent program, it will represent an ongoing, recurring cost to the state. The specific annual cost for the permanent program is not detailed in this measure's appropriations.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The Kona pilot program's duration has been shortened from three years to two years. Appropriations are no longer unspecified; the committee hearing determines specific funding of $514,900 (HB727_CD1) for FY 2025-2026 and $557,000 (HB727_CD1) for FY 2026-2027. Responsibility for mental health services has been shifted to the Judiciary, removing the previously noted impact and funding request from the Department of Health. The requirement for a legislative report on program expansion has been deleted, and the First Circuit program is now codified as permanent in the Hawaii Revised Statutes."
