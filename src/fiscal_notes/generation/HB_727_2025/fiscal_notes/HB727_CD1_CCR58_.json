  "overview": "This measure reverts the Women's Court Pilot Program in the Kona division of the Third Circuit from a three-year term back to a two-year pilot, with a new sunset date of June 30, 2027. It makes the First Circuit's Women's Court Program permanent by codifying it into the Hawaii Revised Statutes. The requirement for the Judiciary to report on the need for similar programs in other circuits has been deleted.",
  "appropriations": "The bill's appropriations for the Kona pilot program are no longer unspecified and have been set at $514,900 for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027. These funds are designated for mental health services, substance abuse treatment, equipment, and one temporary probation supervisor position. The previously discussed funding request from the Department of Health is not included in this measure.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "Financial projections are now based on the specific two-year legislative appropriation totaling $1,071,900, rather than the previous three-year budget proposal from the Judiciary. The cost basis associated with the Department of Health's staffing model is no longer applicable. The methodology is now aligned with the confirmed two-year pilot program structure.",
  "agency_impact": "The anticipated operational impact on the Department of Health has been eliminated, as its request for two new positions was not funded in this version of the bill. The Judiciary is now explicitly responsible for providing mental health services under the Kona pilot program. The impact on the Judiciary is now limited to a two-year timeframe and includes managing one new temporary probation supervisor position.",
  "economic_impact": "The cost-benefit analysis for the program is now based on a lower total investment of $1,071,900 over a two-year period. This adjusts the calculation for potential cost savings from reduced incarceration rates. The fundamental premise of offsetting program costs by preventing long-term incarceration remains the same.",
  "policy_impact": "A significant policy change is the codification of the Women's Court Program in the First Circuit into the Hawaii Revised Statutes, elevating it from a session law pilot to a permanent, codified program. Additionally, the measure narrows the state's immediate focus by deleting the requirement for the Judiciary to study expansion into other circuits. This solidifies the program's status in the First Circuit while continuing a limited-term pilot in the Third Circuit.",
  "revenue_sources": "Funding for the program is now secured through a direct legislative appropriation. These funds will be allocated from the state's general funds for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027. No other revenue sources are identified in the measure.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The fiscal outlook is now limited to a two-year timeframe, with specified costs of $514,900 in fiscal year 2026 and $557,000 in fiscal year 2027. The pilot program for the Kona division of the Third Circuit is scheduled to sunset on June 30, 2027. Consequently, any discussions regarding permanent funding for the Kona program are now advanced to the legislative session for fiscal year 2028. The potential recurring costs from the Department of Health are no longer a factor. The established recurring costs for the permanent First Circuit program are not detailed in this measure. All other fiscal implications beyond the initial two-year period are contingent upon future legislative action to make the Kona pilot permanent.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The measure now includes a specific appropriation that allocates funds for 'equipment' for the Kona pilot program within the totals for fiscal years 2026 and 2027. This confirms that a capital expenditure component is funded, replacing the previous version where such costs were part of an unspecified appropriation. The exact amount for equipment is not itemized.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The basis for estimating long-term fiscal obligations for the Kona pilot program has changed due to the shorter, two-year term. Should the pilot be made permanent after its sunset on June 30, 2027, the recurring annual cost would likely be modeled on the fiscal year 2027 appropriation of $557,000. These long-term costs no longer include potential expenses related to the Department of Health.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The Kona pilot program has been reduced from three years to two, with the sunset date moved to June 30, 2027. Appropriations are no longer unspecified, with specific amounts of $514,900 (FY26) and $557,000 (FY27) now included in the bill. The Department of Health's funding request was not approved, and the requirement for the Judiciary to report on expansion to other circuits has been deleted, while the First Circuit program has been made permanent by statute."
