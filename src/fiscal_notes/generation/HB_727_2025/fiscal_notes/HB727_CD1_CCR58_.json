  "overview": "The purpose of this Act is to permanently establish the women's court program in the first circuit. [13] It also establishes a two-year women's court pilot program in the circuit court of the Kona division of the third circuit. [13] The bill also requires the judiciary to submit reports to the legislature regarding the pilot program for women's court. [13]",
  "appropriations": "There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $514,900 (HB727_CD1_.HTM.txt) or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 (HB727_CD1_.HTM.txt) or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2026-2027. [13] These funds are for mental health, substance abuse treatment, and other services and equipment, and the establishment of one full-time equivalent (1.0 FTE) temporary Kona drug court probation supervisor position. [13] [13] The sums appropriated shall be expended by the judiciary for the purposes of this Act. [13]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The provided documents do not detail the specific methodology used to calculate the appropriation amounts for the pilot program. [13] The program's goals are to divert participants from incarceration, support their success in the community, and reduce recidivism by implementing trauma-informed and evidence-based practices. [13] The cost assumptions are based on providing services that address trauma and mental health treatment, family support, life-skills training, vocational training, substance abuse treatment, and housing support. [13] [13]",
  "agency_impact": "The judiciary is responsible for establishing the permanent women's court program in the first circuit. [13] It must also establish the women's court pilot program within the third circuit Kona division, which will be under the supervision of the big island drug court. [13] The judiciary is also responsible for providing mental health services under the pilot program and submitting reports to the legislature on its findings and recommendations in 2026 and 2027. [13] [13]",
  "economic_impact": "The legislature finds that for women, histories of abuse, trauma, poverty, mental illness, substance use disorders, and unhealthy relationships intersect with their entry into criminal behavior. [13] The program aims to reduce recidivism and divert participants from incarceration, which may lead to long-term cost savings for the state. [13] By addressing unique barriers women offenders face, such as being primary caregivers and lacking stable work history, the program can help them achieve more positive outcomes and economic stability. [13]",
  "policy_impact": "This measure permanently establishes the Women's Court Program in the First Circuit by codifying it in the Hawaii Revised Statutes. [14] It also establishes a temporary two-year Women's Court Pilot Program within the Kona division of the Third Circuit. [13] This represents a change from a previous version of the bill, which proposed a three-year pilot program. [14]",
  "revenue_sources": "The program is funded by an appropriation out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii. [13] The measure appropriates the sum of $514,900 (HB727_CD1_.HTM.txt) for fiscal year 2025-2026. [13] An additional $557,000 (HB727_CD1_.HTM.txt) is appropriated from general revenues for fiscal year 2026-2027. [13]",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The measure appropriates $514,900 (HB727_CD1_.HTM.txt) in FY 2025-2026 and $557,000 (HB727_CD1_.HTM.txt) in FY 2026-2027 from the general fund for the Kona pilot program. [13] The pilot program and its associated funding are set to be repealed on June 30, 2027. [13] The appropriation covers mental health and substance abuse treatment, other services, equipment, and one temporary (1.0 FTE) Kona drug court probation supervisor position. [13] [13] Making the First Circuit women's court program permanent creates an ongoing fiscal obligation, though no specific funds are appropriated for that purpose in this Act. [13] The Judiciary must submit reports on the pilot program prior to the 2026 and 2027 legislative sessions. [13] These reports will include recommendations as to whether the pilot program should continue, expand, provide additional services, or be discontinued. [13] The findings in these reports will inform future fiscal decisions. [13]",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The provided legislative documents do not indicate any anticipated impact on operating revenues resulting from this measure.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The provided legislative documents do not specify any major capital expenditures. [13] The appropriation includes funding for \"equipment\" for the women's court pilot program. [13] No funds are allocated for facilities or other significant capital investments. [13]",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "Part III of the Act, which establishes the women's court pilot program in the Kona division, will be repealed on June 30, 2027, ending the fiscal obligations for that specific program. [13] However, the measure makes the Women's Court Program in the First Circuit permanent. [13] This will result in ongoing fiscal implications beyond the six-year period to sustain the First Circuit program, though the associated costs are not specified in this measure. [13]",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "This version of the bill restores specific appropriation amounts, which were previously unspecified; the pilot program's duration is reduced from three years to two. [14] [14] The number of temporary FTE positions is reduced from two to one, with only the Kona drug court probation supervisor position remaining. [14] A requirement for the Judiciary to report on the need for pilot programs in other circuits has been deleted. [14] The sunset date for the Kona pilot program has been moved from 2028 to June 30, 2027, and the defective effective date has been corrected to July 1, 2025. [14] [14]",
  "fte_positions": "The measure appropriates funds for the establishment of one full-time equivalent (1.0 FTE) temporary Kona drug court probation supervisor position. [13] This is a change from a previous version of the bill that had authorized two temporary positions. [14] The second position, a peer specialist, is no longer included in the measure. [13]",
  "appropriations_changes": "This version of the bill has been amended to include specific appropriation amounts, which were unspecified in the prior version. [14] The measure appropriates $514,900 (HB727_CD1_CCR58_.htm.txt) for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 (HB727_CD1_CCR58_.htm.txt) for fiscal year 2026-2027. [14] The purpose of the appropriation is for services, equipment, and one temporary position for the Kona pilot program. [14]",
  "funding_sources_changes": "The method of funding remains the general revenues of the State of Hawaii. [13] The significant change from the previous version is that the appropriation amounts from the general fund are now specified. [14] There are no other changes to the funding source. [13]",
  "department_impact": "The sums appropriated shall be expended by the judiciary. [13] There are no changes to the department responsible for expending the funds compared to the previous fiscal note. [13] The Judiciary is responsible for implementing the permanent program and the pilot program. [13] [13]",
  "reports_required": "This version deletes the language that would have required the Judiciary to submit a report regarding the need for a pilot program in the Second and Fifth Circuits and Hilo division of the Third Circuit. [14] The judiciary is still required to submit a report of its findings and recommendations on the Kona pilot program to the governor and legislature before the regular sessions of 2026 and 2027. [13] This report must include recommendations on whether the pilot program should continue, expand, or be discontinued. [13]",
  "pilot_program": "The conference committee has amended this measure by changing the duration of the Women's Court Pilot Program in the Kona division of the Third Circuit from three years to two years. [14] [14] The bill continues to make the women's court program in the first circuit permanent. [13] The women's court pilot program shall be under the supervision of the big island drug court. [13]",
  "sunset_date": "The sunset date for the Women's Court Pilot Program in the Kona division of the Third Circuit has been changed to June 30, 2027. [14] Part III of this Act, which establishes the pilot program, shall be repealed on this date. [13]",
  "effective_date": "The effective date for the Act has been changed to July 1, 2025. [14] This corrects a defective effective date from a previous version of the measure. [14]"
