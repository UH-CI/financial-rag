  "overview": "The pilot program for the Third Circuit's Kona division has been reduced from a three-year to a two-year plan, with an updated sunset date of June 30, 2027. Consequently, the Judiciary's reporting requirements have been shortened to the 2026 and 2027 regular sessions. The previous mandate to report on the potential expansion of the program to other circuits has been removed from the measure.",
  "appropriations": "Specific appropriation amounts have been reinstated into the bill, replacing the prior unspecified funding levels. The measure now allocates $514,900 in fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 in fiscal year 2026-2027 from the general fund for the Kona pilot program. These funds will cover services, equipment, and the establishment of one temporary full-time drug court probation supervisor position.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The financial model has been revised to reflect a two-year pilot program with legislatively determined costs, rather than the previous three-year projection based on an agency request. The cost basis associated with a separate funding request from the Department of Health has been eliminated from the current fiscal analysis. The prior cost-benefit calculation comparing program expenses to the cost of incarcerating six women is no longer included.",
  "agency_impact": "The Judiciary's operational responsibility for the Kona pilot program is now limited to a two-year period, during which it will staff one temporary 1.0 FTE drug court probation supervisor. A new key responsibility has been added, making the Judiciary directly accountable for providing mental health services under the pilot program. The previously anticipated operational impact on the Department of Health is now eliminated, as its role and requested funding have been removed.",
  "economic_impact": "The specific economic justification that compared the total program cost to the expense of incarcerating six women for three years is no longer applicable due to the change in the pilot program's duration and cost structure. While the overarching goal of reducing long-term incarceration costs remains, this updated measure does not provide a revised quantitative analysis.",
  "policy_impact": "The policy debate over funding has been resolved with the insertion of specific appropriation amounts for a defined two-year pilot, ending the uncertainty of the previous version. The measure also settles the issue of inter-agency responsibility by assigning mental health services directly to the Judiciary and omitting any role for the Department of Health. Furthermore, the legislative focus has been narrowed by removing the requirement to study program expansion into other judicial circuits.",
  "revenue_sources": "The measure now explicitly identifies the state's general revenues as the funding source for the appropriated sums. This information was not provided in the documents associated with the previous fiscal note. All appropriated funds are designated for the Judiciary to implement the Act.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The six-year fiscal outlook has been significantly altered, now projecting costs only for a two-year period. The measure appropriates $514,900 for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027 to fund the Kona pilot program. These appropriations cover program services, equipment, and one temporary 1.0 FTE position. This replaces the previous three-year projection that totaled over $1.5 million. Furthermore, the potential recurring annual cost of $221,788 associated with a Department of Health funding request has been removed. The pilot program and its associated funding are scheduled to be repealed on June 30, 2027. Therefore, there are no projected state expenditures for this pilot in fiscal years 2028 through 2031. Any future costs for the Kona program beyond fiscal year 2027 would require new legislative action. While the First Circuit program is made permanent, this bill provides no new appropriations for it, implying its costs are absorbed into the Judiciary's existing budget.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "As the Kona pilot program is repealed on June 30, 2027, it carries no direct fiscal obligations beyond the six-year outlook. The continuation or expansion of the pilot would be contingent on a future legislative decision based on the program's final report. The permanent First Circuit program will have ongoing operating costs, but these are assumed to be part of the Judiciary's base budget rather than new costs generated by this measure.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The primary updates are the reversion of the Kona pilot program from a three-year to a two-year term and the reinsertion of specific general fund appropriations totaling $1,071,900 over two years. This resolves the previous version's unspecified funding and removes the Department of Health's competing funding request by assigning its proposed duties to the Judiciary. The bill's scope has also been narrowed by deleting the mandate to study program expansion to other circuits."
