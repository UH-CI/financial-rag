  "overview": "The purpose of this measure is to make the Women's Court Pilot Program in the First Circuit permanent and establish a Women's Court Pilot Program in the Kona division of the Third Circuit (HB727_CD1_.HTM.txt). The Committee on Conference has amended this measure by changing the duration of the pilot program in the Kona division \"from three years to two years\" (HB727_CD1_.HTM.txt). The measure now has an effective date of July 1, 2025, and a sunset date for the pilot program of June 30, 2027 (HB727_CD1_.HTM.txt).",
  "appropriations": "The measure appropriates specific amounts for the two-year pilot program, replacing the previous unspecified amounts. The legislative document specifies an appropriation of \"$514,900 (HB727_CD1_.HTM.txt) for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 (HB727_CD1_.HTM.txt) for fiscal year 2026-2027\" (HB727_CD1_.HTM.txt). These funds are designated for \"mental health, substance abuse treatment, and other services and equipment, and the establishment of one full-time equivalent temporary Kona drug court probation supervisor position\" (HB727_CD1_.HTM.txt).",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The financial projections are now based on a two-year pilot program, as the Committee on Conference amended the measure by \"Changing the duration of the Women's Court Pilot Program in the Kona division of the Third Circuit from three years to two years\" (HB727_CD1_.HTM.txt). The new timeline is reflected in the specified appropriations for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027. The program has a new \"sunset date...to June 30, 2027\" (HB727_CD1_.HTM.txt).",
  "agency_impact": "The Conference Committee has amended the measure by \"Requiring the Judiciary to be responsible for providing mental health services under the Women's Court Pilot Program in the Kona division of the Third Circuit\" (HB727_CD1_.HTM.txt). This shifts the responsibility for mental health services to the Judiciary, contrasting with previous testimony from the Department of Health. The appropriation provides for the \"establishment of one full-time equivalent temporary Kona drug court probation supervisor position\" within the Judiciary (HB727_CD1_.HTM.txt).",
  "economic_impact": "",
  "policy_impact": "This measure has been amended by \"Codifying the Women's Court Program in the First Circuit within the Hawaii Revised Statutes, rather than the Session Laws of Hawaii\" (HB727_CD1_.HTM.txt), making it a permanent program. Additionally, the committee is \"Deleting language that would have required the Judiciary to submit a report to the Legislature regarding the need for and the associated costs of a pilot program for Women's Court in the Second and Fifth Circuits and Hilo division of the Third Circuit\" (HB727_CD1_.HTM.txt). This removes the mandate for a study on program expansion.",
  "revenue_sources": "",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The fiscal outlook for the Kona Women's Court Pilot Program has been revised to a two-year period, superseding the previous three-year proposal. The legislative document specifies appropriations of \"$514,900 (HB727_CD1_.HTM.txt) for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 (HB727_CD1_.HTM.txt) for fiscal year 2026-2027\" (HB727_CD1_.HTM.txt). These funds will cover costs for \"mental health, substance abuse treatment, and other services and equipment\" (HB727_CD1_.HTM.txt). The budget also supports the \"establishment of one full-time equivalent temporary Kona drug court probation supervisor position\" (HB727_CD1_.HTM.txt). The pilot program is now set with a \"sunset date...to June 30, 2027\" (HB727_CD1_.HTM.txt). There are no further fiscal implications outlined in this measure beyond this date, as the requirement for a report on expansion has been deleted.",

The measure no longer contains provisions for assessing future expansion. The language requiring the Judiciary to report on the costs of a pilot program in other circuits has been deleted (HB727_CD1_.HTM.txt).",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The duration of the Kona division pilot program has been shortened from three years to two years, with a new sunset date of June 30, 2027 (HB727_CD1_.HTM.txt). Appropriations are no longer unspecified; the measure now appropriates \"$514,900 (HB727_CD1_.HTM.txt) for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 (HB727_CD1_.HTM.txt) for fiscal year 2026-2027\" (HB727_CD1_.HTM.txt). Responsibility for providing mental health services has been assigned to the Judiciary, and a temporary probation supervisor position will be established (HB727_CD1_.HTM.txt). A significant policy change is the deletion of the requirement for the Judiciary to report on the costs of expanding the program to other circuits, and the First Circuit program is now codified in the Hawaii Revised Statutes (HB727_CD1_.HTM.txt)."
