The new pilot program will be under the supervision of the Big Island Drug Court and is intended to address the individualized needs of women in the criminal justice system (HB727_SD1_.HTM.txt). The measure also requires the Judiciary to submit a report to the legislature on the need for and costs associated with expanding the program to the Second and Fifth Circuits and the Hilo division of the Third Circuit (HB727_SD1_.HTM.txt).\",\n\"appropriations\": \"The legislative document specifies an appropriation of $514,900 (HB727_SD1_.HTM.txt) for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 (HB727_SD1_.HTM.txt) for fiscal year 2026-2027 for the pilot program in the Kona division of the Third Circuit (HB727_SD1_.HTM.txt). These funds are allocated for services and two temporary positions (HB727_SD1_.HTM.txt). The Judiciary's testimony requests these funds to cover costs for a Women's Mental Health Professional, behavioral health beds, a probation supervisor, cultural practitioners, peer specialists, therapy, drug testing, training, and technology (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-19-25_.PDF.txt).\",\n\"assumptions_and_methodology\": \"The Third Circuit's proposal is based on a two-year pilot project in the Kona Division, acknowledging the \\\"lack of availability of community-based mental health services\\\" and the need to establish \\\"direct-provider positions and funding for direct services\\\" (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-19-25_.PDF.txt). The program would operate under the supervision of the Big Island Drug Court, leveraging its existing structure while adding specialized resources (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-19-25_.PDF.txt). The initial cohort for the Kona Women's Court program would be sourced from \\\"all fourteen (14) of the women currently participating in the Kona BIDC program\\\" who would be screened for eligibility (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-19-25_.PDF.txt).\",\n\"agency_impact\": \"This measure shifts the focus of the pilot program by \\\"Establishing a three—year Women's Court Pilot Program in the circuit court of the Kona division of the Third Circuit, rather than the Second and Fifth Circuits\\\" (HB727_SD1_.HTM.txt). In its testimony, the Judiciary requested \\\"that the Second and Fifth Circuits be deleted from consideration for this pilot project, at this time\\\" (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-19-25_.PDF.txt). Instead of an interim study, the Judiciary is now required to \\\"submit a report to the Legislature no later than forty days prior to the Regular Session of 2026 regarding the need for and the associated costs of a pilot program for Women's Court in the Second and Firth Circuits and Hilo division of the Third Circuit\\\" (HB727_SD1_.HTM.txt).\",\n\"economic_impact\": \"The Judiciary's proposal for the Kona pilot program initially targets the \\\"fourteen (14) women currently participating in the BIDC program in Kona\\\" who are considered \\\"'Priority 1' clients, meaning they have been assessed as having a high risk for recidivism, high rates of substance abuse, and high mental health needs\\\" (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-19-25_.PDF.txt). The program aims to address barriers to treatment in a region where \\\"Hawaiʻi County also has the highest poverty rate in the State at 13.8%\\\" and the median household income in its poorest areas is only \\\"$50,313 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-19-25_.PDF.txt) per year\\\" (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-19-25_.PDF.txt).

It also formalizes the Judiciary's request to shift the new pilot program to the Third Circuit, specifically establishing it \\\"in the circuit court of the Kona division of the Third Circuit, rather than the Second and Fifth Circuits\\\" (HB727_SD1_.HTM.txt). Furthermore, the bill deletes the requirement for an interim study and instead mandates a report on the feasibility of future expansion to other circuits, reflecting a revised legislative strategy for statewide implementation (HB727_SD1_.HTM.txt).\",\n\"revenue_sources\": \"The legislative document specifies that funding for the pilot program is appropriated \\\"out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii\\\" (HB727_SD1_.HTM.txt). The total appropriation for the first two years is $514,900 (HB727_SD1_.HTM.txt) for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 (HB727_SD1_.HTM.txt) for fiscal year 2026-2027.

Year 1 costs total $514,900.00 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-19-25_.PDF.txt), which includes $175,000.00 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-19-25_.PDF.txt) for a Women's Mental Health Professional, $100,000.00 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-19-25_.PDF.txt) for Women's Behavioral Health Beds, and $85,000.00 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-19-25_.PDF.txt) for a Probation Supervisor. Additional Year 1 costs are $80,000.00 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-19-25_.PDF.txt) for a Peer Specialist, $30,000.00 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-19-25_.PDF.txt) for a Cultural Practitioner, $25,000.00 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-19-25_.PDF.txt) for Moral Reconation Therapy, $10,000.00 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-19-25_.PDF.txt) for drug testing, $5,000.00 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-19-25_.PDF.txt) for training, and $4,900.00 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-19-25_.PDF.txt) for technology (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-19-25_.PDF.txt). Year 2 costs total $557,000.00 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-19-25_.PDF.txt), with most costs recurring except for training increasing to $42,000.00 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-19-25_.PDF.txt), technology costs being eliminated, and a new cost of $10,000.00 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-19-25_.PDF.txt) for program evaluation (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-19-25_.PDF.txt). The bill appropriates these exact amounts for FY 2026 and FY 2027 (HB727_SD1_.HTM.txt). Although the bill establishes a three-year pilot, it only funds the first two years, implying a future request for the third year and beyond. The testimony notes the ultimate goal is to make the program permanent and expand to Hilo (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-19-25_.PDF.txt).\",\n\"operating_revenue_impact\": \"The provided documents do not contain any information regarding the impact of this measure on operating revenues.\",\n\"capital_expenditure_impact\": \"The Judiciary's testimony requests funding for technology purchases totaling $4,900.00 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-19-25_.PDF.txt) in the first year of the pilot program (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-19-25_.PDF.txt). These funds are for a \\\"Computer Workstation (in Probation Waiting A[rea])\\\" at a cost of $1,200.00 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-19-25_.PDF.txt), a \\\"Computer for Kona Probation Supervisor\\\" for $1,000.00 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-19-25_.PDF.txt), and a \\\"Kona Laptop for Work in Rural Communities\\\" for $1,200.00 (HB727_HD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-19-25_.PDF.txt).

This indicates a long-term fiscal commitment to continue the program's operations in Kona and potentially expand its services to East Hawai'i.
