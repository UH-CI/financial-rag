  "overview": "This bill permanently establishes the women's court program in the first circuit, which focuses on non-violent, high-risk women offenders. It also establishes a new, two-year women's court pilot program in the Kona division of the third circuit to address the specific needs of women in the criminal justice system. The measure requires the Judiciary to submit reports to the legislature on the pilot program's progress and includes a sunset clause for the pilot program on June 30, 2027.",
  "appropriations": "The bill appropriates $514,900 in fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 in fiscal year 2026-2027 from the state's general revenues. These funds are designated for the third circuit's pilot program to cover costs for mental health services, substance abuse treatment, other support services, and equipment. The appropriation also funds the establishment of one temporary full-time equivalent (1.0 FTE) probation supervisor position for the Kona drug court.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal projections are based directly on the specific appropriations outlined in the bill for the establishment and operation of the two-year pilot program in the third circuit. The cost estimation accounts for the personnel expenses of one temporary FTE position and the procurement of necessary services like mental health and substance abuse treatment. The methodology does not rely on historical budgets from comparable programs but rather on the explicit funding amounts designated by the legislature for this new initiative.",
  "agency_impact": "The Judiciary will experience a direct operational and administrative impact from this measure. It will be responsible for making the first circuit's women's court program a permanent part of its operations and for establishing and managing the new two-year pilot program in the third circuit's Kona division. This includes supervising the pilot program under the Big Island Drug Court, hiring one temporary probation supervisor, providing mental health services, and preparing status reports for the legislature.",
  "economic_impact": "The measure is expected to generate long-term economic benefits by diverting women from incarceration, which can lead to significant cost savings for the state's correctional system. By providing services like substance abuse treatment, life-skills training, and housing support, the program aims to reduce recidivism and help participants become stable and productive community members. The first circuit's existing program, Mohala Wahine, currently serves 23 participants, indicating a demand that, if met, could reduce future criminal justice expenditures.",
  "policy_impact": "This bill amends Hawaii Revised Statutes Chapter 603 to permanently authorize the women's court in the first circuit, formalizing a shift towards trauma-informed, gender-responsive justice. It expands this policy approach by creating a temporary pilot program in the third circuit, signaling a broader legislative strategy to address the root causes of criminal behavior among women. The measure's reporting requirement will inform future policy decisions regarding the potential statewide expansion or discontinuation of such specialized courts.",
  "revenue_sources": "The funding for this measure is sourced entirely from the general revenues of the State of Hawaii. The bill specifies appropriations from the general fund for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027. There are no other revenue streams, such as federal grants or user fees, identified in the legislation to support this program.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The bill outlines a clear fiscal impact for the first two years of the six-year period. For fiscal year 2026, the appropriation is $514,900, and for fiscal year 2027, it is $557,000. These funds support the establishment of a two-year women's court pilot program in the third circuit, including one temporary 1.0 FTE probation supervisor position and various participant services. The increase in funding from FY26 to FY27 likely accounts for salary step increases for the new position and inflationary costs for contracted services. As the pilot program and the temporary position are set to be repealed on June 30, 2027, there are no further appropriations for this pilot in fiscal years 2028 through 2031. The first circuit program is made permanent, but no new appropriations are specified for it, suggesting its costs will be absorbed into the Judiciary's existing operational budget. Any fiscal implications beyond FY27 for the third circuit program are contingent upon future legislative action based on the required program reports. Therefore, the direct fiscal impact from this bill ceases after the second year. The ongoing costs of the permanent first circuit program will continue but are not quantified in this bill.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "This measure is not expected to have any impact on the state's operating revenues. The programs are funded through general fund appropriations and do not include provisions for collecting fees, fines, or other forms of revenue. Therefore, no increase or decrease in state revenue streams is anticipated as a result of this bill.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The bill does not include any significant capital expenditures for facilities or major infrastructure. The appropriations include funding for unspecified 'equipment' for the pilot program, which represents a minor capital outlay. There are no provisions for the construction, renovation, or acquisition of buildings to support either the permanent or pilot programs.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "After the initial six-year period, the fiscal implications will differ for the two circuits. The permanent establishment of the women's court program in the first circuit will result in ongoing annual operating costs that will become part of the Judiciary's base budget. Conversely, the pilot program in the third circuit is scheduled to terminate in 2027, so it will have no fiscal obligations after that date unless the legislature passes new legislation to extend or make it permanent.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "No previous fiscal note was provided. This is the first fiscal note for this measure."
