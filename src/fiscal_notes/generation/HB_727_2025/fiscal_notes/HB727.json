  "overview": "The purpose and intent of this measure is to make the Women's Court Pilot Program in the First Circuit permanent and to establish a three-year Women's Court Pilot Program in the circuit court of the Kona division of the Third Circuit. This measure is intended to acknowledge the distinct pathways that lead women into the criminal justice system and address their individualized needs. The Judiciary is also required to submit a report to the Legislature regarding the need for and the associated costs of a pilot program for Women's Court in the Second and Fifth Circuits and the Hilo division of the Third Circuit.",
  "appropriations": "The measure inserts an appropriation amount of $514,900 (HB727) for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 (HB727) for fiscal year 2026-2027. These funds are designated for services and two temporary positions for the Women's Court Pilot Program in the Kona division of the Third Circuit. The measure also deletes language that would have appropriated an unspecified amount of funds to the Department of Health for an unspecified number of temporary positions.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The appropriations are based on data and information provided by the Judiciary in testimony at the public hearing on this measure, which identified the need to close the service gap for the most at-risk women in the Kona area. The decision to expand the program is informed by the success of the First Circuit's Mohala Wahine pilot program, which has been operational since January 2023. The cost estimations cover services and staffing for the new three-year pilot program.",
  "agency_impact": "This measure will have a direct impact on the Judiciary by making the Women's Court Pilot Program in the First Circuit permanent and establishing a new three-year pilot program in the Kona division of the Third Circuit. The new program will be under the supervision of the Big Island Drug Court and will require two temporary positions. The Judiciary is also tasked with submitting a report to the Legislature no later than forty days prior to the Regular Session of 2026.",
  "economic_impact": "This measure aims to enhance community safety by reducing recidivism through evidence-based, trauma-informed care. The existing Women's Court Pilot Program has been successful, with eleven participants in phase one of treatment and twelve participants in phase two of treatment. The program will support women dealing with trauma, abuse, and unhealthy relationships by providing substance abuse treatment, mental health support, and assistance with navigating the criminal and social services systems.",
  "policy_impact": "This measure amends state law by making the Women's Court Pilot Program in the First Circuit, established by Act 243, Session Laws of Hawaii 2022, permanent. It establishes a new three-year pilot program in the Kona division of the Third Circuit, rather than the originally proposed Second and Fifth Circuits. The measure also deletes the requirement for the Third Circuit to conduct an interim study, instead moving directly to establish and fund the pilot program.",
  "revenue_sources": "The document does not specify the revenue source for the appropriations. The measure appropriates $514,900 (HB727) for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 (HB727) for fiscal year 2026-2027 for the new pilot program in the Third Circuit. These funds are appropriated for services and two temporary positions.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The fiscal implications for the next six years include an appropriation of $514,900 (HB727) in fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 (HB727) in fiscal year 2026-2027 for the three-year Women's Court Pilot Program in the Kona division of the Third Circuit. These funds are for services and two temporary positions. Funding for the third year of the pilot program in fiscal year 2027-2028 is not specified but would be necessary for the program's completion. The measure also makes the Women's Court Pilot Program in the First Circuit permanent, implying ongoing operating costs, though no specific appropriation for this is included. The Judiciary is also required to submit a report to the Legislature prior to the Regular Session of 2026, which may lead to future fiscal implications if it recommends program expansion to the Second and Fifth Circuits.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The provided document does not indicate any anticipated impacts on operating revenues resulting from this measure. The program is funded through legislative appropriations. There is no mention of fees for services or other revenue streams.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The provided document does not outline any expected capital expenditures related to this measure. The appropriations are specified for \"services and two temporary positions for the Women's Court Pilot Program in the Kona division of the Third Circuit\" (HB727). No investments in facilities, equipment, or technology infrastructure are mentioned.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The Women's Court Pilot Program in the Third Circuit is established as a three-year pilot, meaning its continuation beyond fiscal year 2028 would require further legislative action and appropriation. The measure makes the First Circuit's Mohala Wahine Pilot Program permanent, indicating an ongoing fiscal obligation to sustain its annual operating costs indefinitely. The long-term fiscal impact will depend on the success of the pilot program and future decisions to expand the model to other circuits.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "No previous fiscal note was provided for comparison. This fiscal note is based solely on the analysis of H.B. No. 727, H.D. 1, S.D. 1."
