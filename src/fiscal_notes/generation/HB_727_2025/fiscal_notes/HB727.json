  "overview": "This measure establishes a three-year Women's Court Pilot Program in the Kona division of the Third Circuit to provide gender-responsive, trauma-informed services for women in the criminal justice system. It also makes the existing Women's Court Pilot Program in the First Circuit permanent. The Judiciary is further required to submit a report to the Legislature on the costs associated with expanding the pilot program to other circuits.",
  "appropriations": "The bill appropriates $514,900 (HB727) for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 (HB727) for fiscal year 2026-2027 for the Women's Court Pilot Program in the Third Circuit. These funds are designated for program services and two temporary positions. A previously included, but unspecified, appropriation for the Department of Health was deleted from the measure.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The financial projections and program design are based on the successful Mohala Wahine pilot program established in the First Circuit in 2022. The costs for the new Third Circuit pilot, including services and staffing, were determined based on data and information provided by the Judiciary during testimony. The methodology assumes a similar operational structure and resource need to the existing First Circuit program, adapted for the specific challenges in the Kona area.",
  "agency_impact": "The Judiciary will experience a direct operational impact by establishing and managing the new three-year pilot program in the Third Circuit, which will be supervised by the Big Island Drug Court. This will involve the hiring of two temporary positions and significant administrative oversight. Additionally, the Judiciary is tasked with preparing and submitting a report on potential program expansion, which will require dedicated staff time and resources.",
  "economic_impact": "The program is intended to reduce recidivism, which is expected to generate long-term cost savings for the criminal justice system. By providing targeted support for issues like substance abuse and mental health, the measure aims to decrease costs associated with incarceration and frequent court involvement. The program's goal is to improve participants' stability, which can lead to increased employment and reduced reliance on public assistance.",
  "policy_impact": "This measure modifies state policy by converting the First Circuit's Women's Court Pilot Program, established by Act 243 of the 2022 Session Laws, into a permanent program. It expands this gender-responsive judicial model by creating a new pilot in the Third Circuit, reflecting a broader strategy to implement trauma-informed care. The mandated report on further expansion suggests this model could become a statewide standard, altering how the justice system addresses the needs of female offenders.",
  "revenue_sources": "The document specifies appropriations to fund the program but does not identify the specific revenue source. Such appropriations are typically drawn from the state's general fund. The measure does not establish any new fees, grants, or other dedicated revenue streams to support its activities.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The fiscal implications for the new Third Circuit pilot program are specified for the first two years, with appropriations of $514,900 (HB727) in FY 2026 and $557,000 (HB727) in FY 2027. A third year of funding, likely similar to the FY 2027 amount, will be necessary in FY 2028 to complete the three-year pilot. These costs cover services and two temporary positions. The permanent establishment of the First Circuit program creates an ongoing, recurring annual expense, though the specific amount is not detailed in this bill. The continuation of the Third Circuit program beyond its pilot phase, and any associated costs, is dependent on future legislative action. Furthermore, the required report on expanding the program to the Second, Fifth, and other parts of the Third circuit could lead to significant new appropriations in subsequent years. The overall six-year outlook indicates growing, recurring costs as the program model is proven and potentially expanded.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "This measure is not expected to have any impact on operating revenues. The bill is focused entirely on program expenditures and does not create any new fees, fines, or other sources of income for the state or the Judiciary. Therefore, no change in operating revenue is anticipated.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "There are no capital expenditures anticipated as a result of this measure. The appropriations detailed in the bill are allocated for services and personnel salaries. The text does not mention any funding for the construction of facilities, procurement of major equipment, or investments in technology infrastructure.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "Beyond the initial six-year period, there will be ongoing annual fiscal obligations to operate the permanent Women's Court in the First Circuit. If the Third Circuit pilot is made permanent, its annual operating costs of over $557,000 (HB727) would become a recurring expense. Long-term costs could increase substantially if the Legislature acts on the Judiciary's report and decides to expand the Women's Court model to other circuits across the state.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "While a previous fiscal note was not provided, this document amends the bill significantly. Key changes include making the First Circuit Women's Court program permanent and shifting the new three-year pilot program from the Second and Fifth Circuits to the Kona division of the Third Circuit. The measure now inserts specific appropriation amounts of $514,900 (HB727) for FY 2026 and $557,000 (HB727) for FY 2027, replacing a previously unspecified funding provision. Finally, an interim study requirement was replaced with a legislative report on the costs of future program expansion."
