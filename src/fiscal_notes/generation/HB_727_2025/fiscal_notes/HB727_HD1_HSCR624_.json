  "overview": "This bill now establishes a three-year women's court pilot program in the Second and Fifth Circuits, replacing the previous focus on a pilot in the Third Circuit. Instead of hosting a pilot, the Third Circuit is now required to conduct an interim study and develop a blueprint for a future women's court program. The measure, which aims to divert participants from incarceration through trauma-informed services, includes a new sunset date of June 30, 2028.",
  "appropriations": "Appropriations have been expanded to include the Department of Health (DOH) alongside the Judiciary. A new appropriation of $801,802 is requested for the DOH to fund positions in each pilot circuit, based on the First Circuit's staffing model. The Judiciary is designated to receive funds for an unspecified number of temporary staff, with committee reports recommending consideration for seven positions to support the new pilot programs.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal methodology now incorporates a multi-agency approach for pilot programs in two circuits. The Department of Health's cost estimate of $801,802 is based on replicating the staffing model from the successful First Circuit's Mohala Wahine program for the new locations. The financial projection for the Judiciary is based on establishing a recommended seven temporary positions to administer the pilot programs and oversee the Third Circuit's interim study.",
  "agency_impact": "The measure's impact now extends to the Department of Health (DOH), which will be responsible for providing critical staff support for the new pilot programs. This includes hiring personnel to conduct mental health screenings and psychological assessments for participants in the Second and Fifth Circuits. The Judiciary's role has shifted to managing these new pilot programs and overseeing an interim study in the Third Circuit.",
  "economic_impact": "The economic rationale is strengthened by new performance data from the existing First Circuit program. In 2024, the Department of Health conducted 33 mental health screenings and 24 psychological assessments, demonstrating a significant level of intervention that supports diversion from more costly incarceration. Expanding this model to two additional circuits is anticipated to amplify these cost-saving benefits for the state.",
  "policy_impact": "The policy focus has shifted from making the First Circuit program permanent to expanding the pilot model to the Second and Fifth Circuits. A new, more cautious approach is introduced for the Third Circuit, requiring a study before implementation to ensure the program is tailored to local needs and resources. This change reflects a more data-driven legislative strategy for expanding specialty courts to neighbor islands.",
  "revenue_sources": "",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The fiscal outlook now extends to a three-year pilot program across the Second and Fifth Circuits, set to terminate on June 30, 2028. It includes a requested appropriation of $801,802 for the Department of Health and funding for seven recommended temporary positions within the Judiciary for the duration of the pilot. The previously detailed two-year budget for a Third Circuit pilot is no longer applicable, as that has been replaced by an interim study. No fiscal obligations for these pilot programs are expected beyond fiscal year 2028 without new legislative action.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "While the appropriation for equipment remains unspecified, testimony related to the bill provides more concrete examples of potential minor capital costs. The Third Circuit's proposal outlines $4,900 for technology needs, including a computer workstation for client use and a laptop for fieldwork in rural communities. This illustrates the type of minor capital outlays anticipated to support the new pilot programs.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "As the new pilot programs in the Second and Fifth Circuits are temporary and scheduled to sunset on June 30, 2028, there are no planned ongoing fiscal obligations beyond that date. Unlike the previous version which made the First Circuit program permanent, this version ensures that any future costs would depend entirely on new legislation. The continuation of the programs will be contingent on evaluations submitted to the legislature.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The primary update is the change in the pilot program's scope from a two-year program in the Third Circuit to a three-year program in the Second and Fifth Circuits. Consequently, the Third Circuit's role has been revised to conducting an interim study. A major change is the addition of the Department of Health as a funded agency, with a specific appropriation request of $801,802 for staffing. The provision to make the First Circuit's program permanent has been removed in this version of the measure."
