  "overview": "The purpose of this Act is to establish a three-year women's court pilot program in the circuit court of the second and fifth circuits.

  "policy_impact": "This measure was amended by deleting language that would have established a three-year women's court pilot program in the Third Circuit of the Judiciary.
