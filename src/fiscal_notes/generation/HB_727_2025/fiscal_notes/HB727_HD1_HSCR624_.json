  "overview": "The purpose of this measure is to establish a three-year women's court pilot program in the Second and Fifth Circuits of the Judiciary, deleting language that would have established a pilot program in the Third Circuit. Instead, the measure requires the Third Circuit of the Judiciary and Big Island Drug Court \"to study and submit a report on establishing a women's court pilot program in the Third Circuit (HB727_HD1_HSCR624_)\". The measure has a sunset date of 6/30/2028 (HB727_HD1).",
  "appropriations": "A committee report requests an \"appropriation amount of $801,802 to the Department of Health (HB727_HD1_HSCR624_)\" for temporary positions, including $145,000 (HB727_HD1_HSCR624_) for a clinical psychologist, $76,788 (HB727_HD1_HSCR624_) for a social worker/human services professional IV, and $45,216 (HB727_HD1_HSCR624_) for a social services assistant V. The measure also appropriates funds to the Judiciary for \"equipment; mental health, substance abuse treatment, and other services (HB727_HD1_HSCR624_)\". While the original bill specified seven temporary positions for the Judiciary, the measure was amended to change this to an \"unspecified amount (HB727_HD1_HSCR624_)\".",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The Department of Health's request for a budget of \"$801,802 (HB727_TESTIMONY_JHA_01-30-25_)\" is \"based on the Department’s staffing requirements for the operation of the existing Women’s Court pilot project of the First Circuit (HB727_TESTIMONY_JHA_01-30-25_)\". An alternative two-year pilot program proposed by the Third Circuit was based on the \"lack of availability of community-based mental health services on the neighbor islands (HB727_HD1)\". This proposal included a two-year total cost of $1,071,900.00 (HB727_HD1).",
  "agency_impact": "This measure requires the Third Circuit of the Judiciary to \"study and submit a report on establishing a women's court pilot program (HB727_HD1_HSCR624_)\", rather than establishing a program. The Judiciary will now establish the pilot program in the Second and Fifth Circuits with an \"unspecified amount (HB727_HD1_HSCR624_)\" of temporary positions. The measure also inserts \"an appropriation for the Department of Health for the women's court pilot program, including the establishment of positions (HB727_HD1_HSCR624_)\".",
  "economic_impact": "For the existing First Circuit pilot program, the Department of Health \"conducted 33 mental health screenings and 24 psychological assessments of participants for the program (HB727_TESTIMONY_JHA_01-30-25_)\" in 2024. A Third Circuit proposal identified \"fourteen (14) women currently participating in the Kona BIDC program (HB727_HD1)\" as initial candidates for screening. The proposal also noted a total of \"eighty-two (82) Priority 2 women who could be assessed for mental health needs (HB727_HD1)\" in Kona.",
  "policy_impact": "This measure amends the bill by \"Deleting language that would have established a three-year women's court pilot program in the Third Circuit of the Judiciary (HB727_HD1_HSCR624_)\" and instead requiring a study. The pilot program's focus has shifted to the Second and Fifth circuits. The measure also has a sunset date of 6/30/2028 (HB727_HD1) and an effective date of July 1, 3000, to \"encourage further discussion (HB727_HD1_HSCR624_)\".",
  "revenue_sources": "",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The measure establishes a three-year pilot program in the Second and Fifth circuits that \"Sunsets 6/30/2028 (HB727_HD1)\". A House committee recommends an appropriation of $801,802 (HB727_HD1_HSCR624_) to the Department of Health for positions needed in each circuit. The Department of Health testimony specified this funding would cover a 1.0 FTE Clinical Psychologist for $145,000 (HB727_TESTIMONY_JHA_01-30-25_), a 1.0 FTE Social Worker for $76,788 (HB727_TESTIMONY_JHA_01-30-25_), and a 1.0 FTE Social Services Assistant for $45,216 (HB727_TESTIMONY_JHA_01-30-25_), which would be recurring costs for the duration of the pilot. The Judiciary will receive funds for an \"unspecified amount (HB727_HD1_HSCR624_)\" of temporary positions and other services. An alternative proposal from the Third Circuit for a two-year pilot program outlined a budget of $514,900.00 (HB727_HD1) for Year 1 and $557,000.00 (HB727_HD1) for Year 2. This proposal included annual costs for a Women's Mental Health Professional at $175,000.00 (HB727_HD1) and a Kona Probation Supervisor at $85,000.00 (HB727_HD1). It also budgeted for training at $5,000 (HB727_HD1) in Year 1 and $42,000.00 (HB727_HD1) in Year 2, and technology costs of $4,900.00 (HB727_HD1) in the first year. The measure's effective date was changed to July 1, 3000, to \"encourage further discussion (HB727_HD1_HSCR624_)\".",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The measure appropriates funds to the Judiciary for \"equipment (HB727_HD1_HSCR624_)\". A detailed proposal from the Third Circuit for its own pilot project requested a technology budget of $4,900.00 (HB727_HD1) in the first year. This funding was intended for a \"Computer Workstation (in Probation Waiting A) (HB727_HD1)\" costing $1,200.00 (HB727_HD1) and a \"Kona Laptop for Work in Rural Communities (HB727_HD1)\" costing $1,200.00 (HB727_HD1).",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The women's court pilot program in the Second and Fifth Circuits is temporary and has a sunset date of \"6/30/2028 (HB727_HD1)\". Any continuation of the program would require further legislative action and new appropriations. The required report from the Third Circuit may lead to future fiscal implications if it recommends establishing a new program.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "This fiscal note differs from the previous version as the measure's scope has been significantly altered. The pilot program is now established in the Second and Fifth circuits, with the Third Circuit conducting a study, which reverses the previous focus on a pilot in the Kona division of the Third Circuit. Appropriations have shifted from a specific Judiciary budget for the Kona pilot to a recommended appropriation of $801,802 (HB727_HD1_HSCR624_) to the Department of Health for positions, with an unspecified number of positions for the Judiciary. New details on capital expenditures for Judiciary \"equipment (HB727_HD1_HSCR624_)\" are now included, and the measure no longer makes the First Circuit program permanent."
