  "overview": "This measure makes the Women's Court Pilot Program in the First Circuit permanent and establishes a new three-year Women's Court Pilot Program in the Kona division of the Third Circuit under the supervision of the Big Island Drug Court. It also requires the Judiciary to report on the need and costs to expand the program to the Second and Fifth Circuits and the Hilo division of the Third Circuit. The program is intended to address the distinct pathways that lead women into the criminal justice system through gender-responsive services.",
  "appropriations": "The measure appropriates $514,900 for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027 to the Judiciary for the pilot program in the Kona division of the Third Circuit. These funds are allocated for various services including mental and behavioral health, housing, cultural practices, and therapy, as well as for two temporary positions. Funding for the third year of the pilot is not specified in this measure.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The financial projections are derived from a detailed two-year budget proposal developed by the Third Circuit Judiciary for the Kona Women's Court. This proposal itemizes costs for contracted direct services, including a full-time mental health professional, behavioral health beds, a peer specialist, and cultural practitioners. The methodology also includes costs for a new Judiciary probation supervisor position, increased drug testing capabilities, staff training, and technology.",
  "agency_impact": "The Judiciary will experience a significant operational impact, particularly in the Third Circuit, which will be responsible for establishing and managing the new pilot program within the existing Big Island Drug Court structure. This includes hiring and supervising new staff, administering contracts for mental health and support services, and developing gender-responsive programming. Additionally, the measure formalizes the First Circuit's pilot program as a permanent operational responsibility within the Judiciary's Adult Client Services Branch.",
  "economic_impact": "The program is anticipated to generate long-term economic benefits by reducing recidivism, thereby lowering costs associated with re-arrest and incarceration. By providing trauma-informed treatment, mental health support, and substance abuse services, the measure aims to improve participants' stability and decrease their reliance on social services. The focus on rehabilitation is expected to help participants become productive members of the community and break intergenerational cycles of justice system involvement.",
  "policy_impact": "This measure solidifies the Women's Court as a permanent specialty court within the First Circuit and expands this gender-responsive model to the Third Circuit. It modifies existing criminal justice procedures by establishing a distinct, rehabilitative pathway for women that addresses the root causes of their offenses, such as trauma and substance abuse. The requirement for a report on further expansion signals a broader legislative strategy to implement this trauma-informed approach across the state.",
  "revenue_sources": "The program is funded entirely through general fund appropriations. No special funds, federal grants, user fees, or other dedicated revenue streams are identified in the measure to support its expenditures. The total appropriation from the general fund for the two specified fiscal years is $1,071,900.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The six-year fiscal outlook includes appropriations of $514,900 for FY26 and $557,000 for FY27 for the Third Circuit pilot program. Although it is a three-year pilot, funding for FY28 is not appropriated but would likely be needed at a similar level (approximately $557,000) to complete the pilot. If the program is made permanent, annual costs from FY29 through FY31 are projected to be at least $557,000, plus inflation, to cover recurring expenses for staffing and contracted services. These costs include one permanent Judiciary probation supervisor, one contracted peer specialist, a contracted mental health professional, behavioral health beds, cultural advisors, therapy services, and ongoing operational needs such as drug testing and training. The permanency of the First Circuit program also solidifies its annual operating costs, which are not detailed here, into the Judiciary's base budget for all future years.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "This measure is not expected to have any impact on the State's operating revenues. The program does not create or authorize any new fees, fines, or other charges that would generate revenue. All program costs are supported by general fund appropriations.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The measure includes a minor one-time capital expenditure of $4,900 in the first fiscal year (FY26). These funds are allocated for technology to support the program's operations in the Third Circuit, including a computer workstation for client use and computers, a printer, and a laptop for program staff. No major expenditures for facilities or other significant infrastructure are identified.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "If the Third Circuit pilot program is made permanent after its initial three-year term, it will establish an ongoing annual fiscal obligation of at least $557,000, subject to inflation and future program adjustments. This recurring funding would be necessary to sustain program staffing, contracted mental health services, housing support, and other operational costs for the Kona division. The program's long-term sustainability will depend on continued general fund appropriations from the Legislature.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "No previous fiscal note was provided. However, the measure has evolved significantly, changing from its original proposal to establish pilot programs in the Second, Third, and Fifth Circuits. It was subsequently amended to pilot programs in the Second and Fifth circuits with an interim study for the Third Circuit, before arriving at its current form, which makes the First Circuit program permanent and establishes a new, funded pilot program exclusively in the Kona division of the Third Circuit."
