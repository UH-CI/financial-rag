  "overview": "This measure proposes to establish a temporary three-year Women’s Court pilot program in the circuit court of the second, third, and fifth circuits. [2] As amended, the bill establishes a temporary three-year women's court pilot program within the Second and Fifth Circuits and requires the Third Circuit of the Judiciary and Big Island Drug Court to conduct an interim study to establish a blueprint for a women's court pilot program in the Third Circuit. [3] The intent of the program is to implement trauma informed and evidence-based practices, employ gender-responsive programming, and provide services to women in the court system with the goal of diverting participants from incarceration and reducing recidivism. [2]",
  "appropriations": "The measure appropriates funds to the Judiciary for equipment; mental health, substance abuse treatment, and other services. [4] An appropriation is inserted for the Department of Health for the women's court pilot program, including the establishment of positions. [4] The Committee on Judiciary & Hawaiian Affairs respectfully requests the Committee on Finance to consider an appropriation amount of $801,802 (HB727_HD1_HSCR624_) to the Department of Health. [4]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The Department of Health's requested budget of $801,802 (HB727_TESTIMONY_JHA_01-30-25_) is based on the Department’s staffing requirements for the operation of the existing Women’s Court pilot project of the First Circuit. [2] The Third Circuit's proposal for a Kona Women’s Court pilot project is developed under the pre-existing drug court program, using the established structures of drug court as its “backbone”. [3] The proposal for West Hawai'i is based on the need to develop critical resources and services due to the severe shortage of community-based treatment options on Hawaiʻi Island. [3]",
  "agency_impact": "This measure requires the Third Circuit of the Judiciary and Big Island Drug Court to study and submit a report on establishing a women's court pilot program in the Third Circuit. [4] The Judiciary is also required to submit annual reports on the pilot program throughout its duration. [4] The Department of Health requests funding for this measure to expand services, including staff support, and proposes a budget based on staffing needs for a clinical psychologist, social worker, and social services assistant in each circuit. [2] [2]",
  "economic_impact": "The program has the goal of diverting participants from incarceration, supporting their success in the community, and reducing recidivism. [2] Supportive services are far less costly than incarceration when a person reoffends. [2] By providing services like counseling, housing assistance, and job training, the program helps justice involved women have the support and tools they need to become productive members of society. [2]",
  "policy_impact": "This measure builds upon the successful Women’s Court Pilot Program in the First Circuit, Mohala Wahine, which was established by Act 243, SLH 2022. [2] The bill was amended to delete language that would have established a three-year women's court pilot program in the Third Circuit of the Judiciary. [4] It instead requires the Third Circuit of the Judiciary and Big Island Drug Court to study and submit a report on establishing a women's court pilot program in the Third Circuit. [4]",
  "revenue_sources": "The measure appropriates funds to the Judiciary for equipment and services. [4] It also inserts an appropriation for the Department of Health for the women's court pilot program. [4] The funding source is not specified beyond legislative appropriation. [2]",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The Judiciary proposed a two-year pilot program for Kona with a total cost of $1,071,900 (HB727_HD1). [3] The budget for year one is $514,900 (HB727_HD1) and for year two is $557,000 (HB727_HD1). [3] This budget includes one full-time equivalent position for a Women's Mental Health Professional at $175,000 (HB727_HD1) per year, one FTE for a Kona Drug Court Probation Supervisor at $85,000 (HB727_HD1) per year, and one FTE for a Peer Specialist at $80,000 (HB727_HD1) per year. [3] Contracted services include Womens Behavioral Health Beds at $100,000 (HB727_HD1) annually and a Cultural Practitioner at $30,000 (HB727_HD1) annually. [3] Training is budgeted at $5,000 (HB727_HD1) in year one and $42,000 (HB727_HD1) in year two. [3] Technology costs are budgeted at $4,900 (HB727_HD1) in the first year. [3] The Department of Health requests a recurring budget of $801,802 (HB727_TESTIMONY_JHA_01-30-25_) for the pilot program in the other circuits. [2] The pilot program established by this measure sunsets on June 30, 2028. [2]",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The provided documents do not specify any anticipated impacts on operating revenues resulting from this measure. [3] The measure focuses on appropriations for program expenditures. [2] No new fees, fines, or other revenue streams are created by the bill. [2]",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The Judiciary is appropriated funds for equipment. [4] The Judiciary's proposal for the Kona pilot includes a technology budget of $4,900 (HB727_HD1). [3] This funding is for a computer workstation, a computer and printer for the Kona Probation Supervisor, a cellphone, and a laptop. [3]",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The women's court pilot program sunsets on 6/30/2028. [2] The Judiciary's proposal for the Kona pilot states that if the program is successful, the ultimate goal would be to expand the program to Hilo and make it permanent. [3] Making the program permanent would create ongoing fiscal obligations for staffing and services beyond the pilot period. [3]",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The scope of the pilot program has changed significantly. [3] The current measure establishes a pilot in the Second and Fifth Circuits and requires a study for the Third Circuit, whereas the previous note described a pilot program established only in the Kona division of the Third Circuit. [3] The appropriations are substantially different; the previous note detailed specific funding of $514,900 (HB727_HD1_HSCR624_) and $557,000 (HB727_HD1_HSCR624_) for the Judiciary's Kona pilot and deleted Department of Health (DOH) funding. [4] The current version provides an unspecified appropriation to the Judiciary while inserting an appropriation for the DOH, with a recommended amount of $801,802 (HB727_HD1_HSCR624_). [4] Consequently, the agency impact has shifted from two temporary positions in the Judiciary to an unspecified number, and new positions established within the DOH. [4] [4]"
