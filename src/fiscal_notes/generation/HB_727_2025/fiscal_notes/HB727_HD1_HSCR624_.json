  "overview": "This measure's scope has been significantly altered from establishing a permanent program in the First Circuit and a pilot in the Third Circuit. It now establishes temporary three-year pilot programs in the Second and Fifth Circuits, while requiring the Third Circuit to conduct an interim study instead of launching a program. The provision to make the First Circuit program permanent has been removed from the current version of the bill.",
  "appropriations": "Unlike the previous version which allocated specific funds ($514,900 in FY26 and $557,000 in FY27) solely to the Judiciary for two positions, this measure now directs an unspecified appropriation to the Judiciary for an unspecified number of positions, with a committee report suggesting seven. A new, separate appropriation has been inserted for the Department of Health, with a suggested amount of $801,802, to fund its own temporary positions to support the pilots.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The cost estimation methodology has changed from being based on a Judiciary proposal for the specific needs of the Third Circuit. It now incorporates a Department of Health cost model based on the operational staffing of the successful First Circuit program. This model is used to project costs for the new pilot programs in the Second and Fifth Circuits.",
  "agency_impact": "The agency impact has expanded to include the Department of Health as a primary participant, which will be responsible for hiring new staff such as a clinical psychologist and social worker. The Judiciary's role has shifted from implementing a program in the Third Circuit to establishing pilots in the Second and Fifth Circuits and conducting a study. The total number of new staff across both agencies is anticipated to be significantly higher than the two positions in the prior version.",
  "economic_impact": "",
  "policy_impact": "The policy approach has shifted from making an existing pilot permanent and incrementally expanding, to launching a broader multi-island pilot initiative in the Second and Fifth circuits simultaneously. A decision on the Third Circuit is now deferred pending a study. The measure no longer makes the original First Circuit program a permanent part of the state's criminal justice system.",
  "revenue_sources": "The funding sources have been expanded to include direct appropriations from the general fund to two separate agencies: the Judiciary and the Department of Health. The previous version of the bill directed appropriations only to the Judiciary. This change diversifies the allocation of funds for the program.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The fiscal outlook has changed entirely, removing the specific, two-year funding plan for the Third Circuit and the permanent costs for the First Circuit. It now establishes a three-year funding requirement for pilot programs in the Second and Fifth Circuits, involving both the Judiciary and the Department of Health. The suggested DOH appropriation of $801,802 indicates a potentially higher annual cost for the pilots than previously anticipated for the single Third Circuit program.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The long-term fiscal landscape is different, as the measure no longer creates a permanent program in the First Circuit, thus removing its ongoing base budget costs from consideration. Any fiscal obligations beyond the initial three-year pilot period are now contingent on new legislation to continue the programs in the Second and Fifth Circuits. The focus of potential long-term costs has shifted away from the Third Circuit.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The primary changes in this version of the bill include shifting the new pilot programs from the Third Circuit to the Second and Fifth Circuits, and downgrading the Third Circuit's involvement to an interim study. A major new appropriation for the Department of Health has been added to support the pilots, whereas previously only the Judiciary was funded. Additionally, the provision making the First Circuit's Women's Court a permanent program has been deleted."
