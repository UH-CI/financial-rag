  "overview": "This measure now establishes a three-year Women's Court pilot program in the Second and Fifth Circuits, rather than the Third Circuit. It also removes the provision making the First Circuit's pilot program permanent. Instead of hosting a pilot, the Third Circuit of the Judiciary is now required to conduct a study on establishing a women's court and submit a report.",
  "appropriations": "The bill has been amended to remove the specific appropriation for the Judiciary and instead insert an appropriation for the Department of Health to support the pilot program. The House Committee on Judiciary & Hawaiian Affairs requests an appropriation of $801,802 (HB727_HD1_HSCR624_) to the Department of Health. This funding is intended to establish positions including one clinical psychologist at $145,000 (HB727_HD1_HSCR624_), one social worker at $76,788 (HB727_HD1_HSCR624_), and one social services assistant at $45,216 (HB727_HD1_HSCR624_).",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The cost basis for the program has shifted from the Judiciary's proposal for a Kona-based pilot to the Department of Health's staffing requirements. The Department of Health testimony requests a budget of $801,802 (HB727_TESTIMONY_JHA_01-30-25_) based on the operational and staffing needs of the existing Women's Court pilot project in the First Circuit. This methodology is applied to project the costs for the new pilot programs in the Second and Fifth circuits.",
  "agency_impact": "The primary agency impact has shifted, with the Judiciary now responsible for establishing pilot programs in the Second and Fifth circuits and conducting a study in the Third circuit. The Department of Health is now directly impacted through the establishment of new temporary positions to support the pilot programs. The specific number of temporary staff positions to be established in the Judiciary is now an unspecified amount (HB727_HD1_HSCR624_).",
  "economic_impact": "",
  "policy_impact": "This measure no longer makes the First Circuit's Women's Court program permanent, altering the previous policy direction. The legislative strategy has shifted from a focused pilot in the Third Circuit to broader implementation in the Second and Fifth circuits. The Third Circuit's role has been changed to conducting an interim study, which will inform future policy on statewide expansion.",
  "revenue_sources": "",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The fiscal outlook is now tied to a three-year pilot in the Second and Fifth circuits, primarily funded through the Department of Health. The committee report recommends an appropriation of $801,802 (HB727_HD1_HSCR624_) to the Department of Health, which would likely be a recurring cost for the three-year duration of the pilot program. The previous appropriations to the Judiciary for a Kona pilot, totaling $514,900 (HB727_HD1) for the first year and $557,000 (HB727_HD1) for the second year, are no longer in the measure. The fiscal impact on the Judiciary for conducting the Third Circuit study is unspecified but will require staff resources.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The measure appropriates funds to the Judiciary for equipment (HB727_HD1_HSCR624_), though the amount is unspecified. A previous proposal from the Third Circuit Judiciary detailed technology costs including $1,200 (HB727_HD1) for a computer workstation and $1,000 (HB727_HD1) for a computer for a probation supervisor. However, it is unclear if these specific items are included in the amended bill.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "Since the provision to make the First Circuit program permanent has been removed, there are no longer automatic ongoing fiscal obligations from that program. Future fiscal implications will depend on legislative action following the completion of the three-year pilot in the Second and Fifth circuits and the findings of the Third Circuit's study. Any decision to make these pilot programs permanent would create new recurring annual costs.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The scope of the pilot program has been changed from a single pilot in the Kona division of the Third Circuit to new pilot programs in the Second and Fifth Circuits. Consequently, the Third Circuit is now tasked with conducting an interim study rather than implementing a program. The provision to make the First Circuit's Women's Court permanent has also been removed. Financially, specific appropriations for the Judiciary amounting to $514,900 (HB727_HD1) for year one and $557,000 (HB727_HD1) for year two were deleted and replaced with an appropriation to the Department of Health, with a committee recommendation for $801,802 (HB727_HD1_HSCR624_)."
