Madam and Sir:
Your Committee on
Conference on the disagreeing vote of the House of Representatives to the
amendments proposed by the Senate in H.B. No. 727, H.D. 1,
S.D. 2, entitled:
"A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO THE WOMEN'S
COURT,"
having met, and after full and free discussion, has agreed
to recommend and does recommend to the respective Houses the final passage of
this bill in an amended form.
The purpose of
this measure is to
(1)
Make the Women's Court Pilot Program in the
First Circuit permanent;
(2)
Establish and appropriate funds for a
three-year Women's Court Pilot Program in the Kona division of the Third
Circuit; and
(3)
Require the Judiciary to submit a report to
the Legislature regarding the need for and the associated costs of a pilot
program for Women's Court in the Second and Fifth Circuits and Hilo division of
the Third Circuit.
Your Committee on
Conference has amended this measure by:
(1)
Codifying the Women's Court Program in the
First Circuit within the Hawaii Revised Statutes, rather than the Session Laws
of Hawaii;
(2)
Requiring the Judiciary to be responsible for
providing mental health services under the Women's Court Pilot Program in the
Kona division of the Third Circuit;

Changing the duration of the Women's Court
Pilot Program in the Kona division of the Third Circuit from three years to two
years;

Appropriating $514,900 for fiscal year
2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027 for mental health, substance
abuse treatment, and other services and equipment, and the establishment of one
full-time equivalent temporary Kona drug court probation supervisor position
for the Women's Court Pilot Program in the Kona division of the Third Circuit;
(5)
Deleting language that would have required the
Judiciary to submit a report to the Legislature regarding the need for and the
associated costs of a pilot program for Women's Court in the Second and Fifth
Circuits and Hilo division of the Third Circuit;
(6)
Changing the effective date to July 1, 2025;
(7)
Changing the sunset date for the Women's Court
Pilot Program in the Kona division of the Third Circuit to June 30, 2027; and
(8)
Making technical, nonsubstantive amendments
for the purposes of clarity, consistency, and style.
As affirmed by the
record of votes of the managers of your Committee on Conference that is
attached to this report, your Committee on Conference is in accord with the
intent and purpose of H.B. No. 727, H.D. 1, S.D. 2, as amended
herein, and recommends that it pass Final Reading in the form attached hereto
