RE:
H.B. No. 727
H.D. 1
S.D. 2
Honorable Ronald D. Kouchi
President of the Senate
Thirty-Third State Legislature
Regular Session of 2025
State of Hawaii
Sir:
Your Committee on
Ways and Means, to which was referred H.B. No. 727, H.D. 1,
S.D. 1, entitled:
"A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO THE WOMEN'S
COURT,"
begs leave to report as follows:
The
purpose and intent of this measure is to extend and appropriate moneys for the
Women's Court pilot program.
More
specifically, the measure:
(1)
Makes permanent the Women's Court pilot
program in the First Circuit; and
(2)
Establishes a three-year Women's Court pilot
program in the Kona division of the Third Circuit.
Your Committee
received written comments in support of this measure from the Judiciary,
Department of Health, Maui County Department of the Prosecuting Attorney, State
Council on Mental Health, League of Women Voters of Hawaii, Hawaii Substance
Abuse Coalition, Community Alliance on Prisons, and one individual.
Your Committee
finds that establishing a permanent Women's Court in the First Circuit and a
Women's Court pilot program in the Third Circuit will help reduce recidivism by
providing trauma‑informed, gender-responsive treatment programs for
incarcerated women in the State.
Your Committee
notes that the Department of Health requests $221,788 to support the Kona
division pilot program, including:
(1)
$145,000 for one full-time equivalent (1.0
FTE) Clinical Psychologist; and
(2)
$76,788 for one full-time equivalent (1.0 FTE)
Social Worker or Human Services professional.
Your Committee has
amended this measure by changing the appropriations to unspecified amounts to facilitate
further discussion on the measure.
As affirmed by the
record of votes of the members of your Committee on Ways and Means that is
attached to this report, your Committee is in accord with the intent and
purpose of H.B. No. 727, H.D. 1, S.D. 1, as amended herein, and
recommends that it pass Third Reading in the form attached hereto as H.B.
No. 727, H.D. 1, S.D. 2.
Respectfully submitted on behalf
of the members of the Committee on Ways and Means,
