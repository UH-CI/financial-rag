  "overview": "This bill makes appropriations for fiscal year 2024-2025 to satisfy various claims against the State, its officers, and its employees. The funds are designated for the payment of judgments and settlements in a number of specific legal cases involving multiple state departments. The bill specifies the claimants and the exact amounts to be paid for each settled claim, with all unexpended funds set to lapse on June 30, 2026.",
  "appropriations": "For fiscal year 2024-2025, the bill appropriates a total of $5,158,867.07 (HB990) from general revenues for claims to be expended by the department of the attorney general. It also appropriates $1,250,000.00 (HB990) from the state highway fund for claims against the Department of Transportation's highways division. Additionally, $90,000.00 (HB990) is appropriated from judiciary funds for a claim against the Judiciary.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal amounts are not based on estimates but represent the specific, pre-determined costs of legal settlements and judgments against the State. The methodology involves aggregating the exact amounts listed in the bill for each individual claim. These figures are drawn from official settlement agreements and court-ordered judgments.",
  "agency_impact": "The Department of the Attorney General is responsible for expending $5,158,867.07 (HB990) from general funds to settle various claims. The Department of Transportation is tasked with expending $1,250,000.00 (HB990) from the state highway fund, and the Judiciary will expend $90,000.00 (HB990) from judiciary funds. The primary operational impact is the administrative processing of these one-time payments.",
  "economic_impact": "The primary economic effect of this measure is the satisfaction of the State's legal and financial liabilities to various individuals and entities. This action provides financial compensation to the claimants as determined by legal proceedings. By settling these obligations, the State avoids potential future litigation costs and additional interest accrual.",
  "policy_impact": "This bill does not create new policy but rather serves as a procedural mechanism to fulfill the State's legal obligations by appropriating funds for specific claims. It acknowledges that the appropriation from the general fund will cause the state's expenditure ceiling to be exceeded for fiscal year 2024-2025, a declaration required by the state constitution. This measure is a routine legislative action to approve payments for legal settlements and judgments.",
  "revenue_sources": "The payments for these claims are funded from three separate sources as specified in the bill. The majority of claims, totaling $5,158,867.07 (HB990), are funded by the State's general revenues. Claims related to the highways division, amounting to $1,250,000.00 (HB990), are sourced from the state highway fund, while a single judiciary claim of $90,000.00 (HB990) is paid from judiciary funds.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The fiscal implications of this act are limited to a single fiscal year, 2024-2025. The bill makes one-time appropriations to settle specific, existing claims and does not establish any ongoing programs or recurring costs. The total appropriations are $5,158,867.07 (HB990) from general funds, $1,250,000.00 (HB990) from the state highway fund, and $90,000.00 (HB990) from judiciary funds. There are no associated staffing changes or future program expansions tied to this measure. A lapse date of June 30, 2026, is set for any unexpended or unencumbered balances. Therefore, there are no further fiscal implications for the State from this specific act in the subsequent five years. Although the State may face future claims, they are not part of this bill's fiscal outlook.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "This bill has no impact on the State's operating revenues. It is an expenditure bill that appropriates existing state funds to pay for legal liabilities. The measure does not introduce any new taxes, fees, or other sources of revenue.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "There are no capital expenditures associated with this bill. All appropriated funds are designated for the payment of legal claims, settlements, and judgments. The measure does not allocate any funding for facilities, major equipment, or technology infrastructure.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "This act has no fiscal implications beyond the initial appropriation period. The funding is a one-time allocation to resolve specific legal liabilities, with no ongoing financial commitments. Any unspent funds will lapse on June 30, 2026, meaning there will be no remaining financial obligations from this bill after that date.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "No previous fiscal note was provided in the source documents. Therefore, a comparison of updates cannot be conducted."
