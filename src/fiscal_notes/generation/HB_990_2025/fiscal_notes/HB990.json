  "overview": "This bill makes appropriations for claims against the State, its officers, or its employees for the fiscal year 2024-2025. The scope is to satisfy claims for legislative relief for various named persons, firms, corporations, and entities. Key components include payments for judgments, settlements, overpayment of taxes, refunds, and other liabilities, with a lapse date for unexpended funds set for June 30, 2026.",
  "appropriations": "For fiscal year 2024-2025, the legislative document specifies appropriations of $5,158,867.07 (HB990_.HTM.txt) from the general revenues, $1,250,000.00 (HB990_.HTM.txt) from the state highway fund, and $90,000.00 (HB990_.HTM.txt) from judiciary funds. These funds are for the purpose of satisfying claims, judgments, and settlements against the State. The sums are to be expended by the department of the attorney general, the department of transportation's highways division, and the judiciary, respectively.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The financial projections are based on specific, itemized claims against the state that have been resolved through judgments or settlements. The methodology involves appropriating the exact amounts required for \"payments of judgments or settlements, or other liabilities, in the amounts set forth opposite their names\" in the bill (HB990_.HTM.txt). Therefore, the costs are not estimates but are predetermined liabilities that the State is legally obligated to pay.",
  "agency_impact": "The department of the attorney general is responsible for expending the $5,158,867.07 (HB990_.HTM.txt) appropriated from general revenues. The department of transportation, highways division, will expend the $1,250,000.00 (HB990_.HTM.txt) appropriated from the state highway fund. The judiciary is tasked with expending the $90,000.00 (HB990_.HTM.txt) appropriated from judiciary funds.",
  "economic_impact": "The measure addresses outstanding financial obligations by providing \"payments of judgments or settlements, or other liabilities\" (HB990_.HTM.txt) to various parties. This action provides \"legislative relief\" (HB990_.HTM.txt) to the claimants and finalizes the State's liabilities in these specific cases. The payments represent a transfer of funds from the state to individuals, firms, and corporations.",
  "policy_impact": "This bill directly addresses \"claims against the State, its officers, or its employees\" (HB990_.HTM.txt) by appropriating funds for their settlement. The measure acknowledges that the \"state general fund expenditure ceiling for fiscal year 2024-2025 has already been exceeded\" (HB990_.HTM.txt). It justifies further exceeding the ceiling by stating the appropriation is \"necessary to serve the public interest and to meet the needs addressed by this Act\" (HB990_.HTM.txt).",
  "revenue_sources": "The funding for these claims is sourced from three separate funds as specified in the legislative document. Part I appropriates funds \"out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii\" (HB990_.HTM.txt). Part II appropriates funds \"out of the state highway fund\" (HB990_.HTM.txt). Part III appropriates funds \"out of the judiciary funds\" (HB990_.HTM.txt).",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The appropriations in this Act are specifically for fiscal year 2024-2025 and are not recurring. The bill details numerous one-time payments for specific claims, such as $442,504.75 (HB990_.HTM.txt) for Maui Kupono Builders, LLC, and $460.00 (HB990_.HTM.txt) for Sarah Ann D. Pacheco under miscellaneous claims. From the Department of Land and Natural Resources, claims include $450,000.00 (HB990_.HTM.txt) for Jennifer Reber v.

The bill states, \"All unexpended and unencumbered balances of the appropriations made in this Act as of the close of business on June 30, 2026, shall lapse\" (HB990_.HTM.txt). Consequently, there are no ongoing fiscal implications beyond this lapse date from this specific legislation.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "This measure makes appropriations to pay for claims against the State and has no provisions for generating revenue. Therefore, it is not expected to have any impact on the State's operating revenues. The bill is solely an expenditure measure.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "This bill does not include any capital expenditures. The funds are appropriated exclusively for the \"purpose of satisfying claims for legislative relief\" (HB990_.HTM.txt) through payments of settlements and judgments. No funds are allocated for construction, infrastructure, or other capital investments.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "There are no fiscal implications after the six-year period. The appropriations are for specific, non-recurring liabilities to be paid in fiscal year 2024-2025. Per the bill, any unexpended funds lapse on June 30, 2026, and the Act does not create any ongoing programs or financial commitments.",
