  "overview": "As amended, H.B. 990 now incorporates nine additional claims that were resolved after the bill's initial introduction, as requested by the Department of the Attorney General. This change significantly increases the scope and total appropriation of the measure. The bill also now includes a declaration related to exceeding the state's general fund expenditure ceiling.",
  "appropriations": "The total appropriation for fiscal year 2024-2025 has been increased to $5,911,234.22 to satisfy seventeen claims. This total includes $4,571,234.22 from general funds and $1,340,000 from departmental funds ($1,250,000 from the state highway fund and $90,000 from judiciary funds). The amendment reflects an increase of $3,572,898.47 to cover nine newly resolved claims.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "",
  "agency_impact": "The inclusion of new claims expands the list of impacted agencies required to process payments. In addition to the Attorney General, DOT, and Judiciary, the measure now directly involves the Department of Defense, Department of Education, Department of Land and Natural Resources, and the Department of Law Enforcement.",
  "economic_impact": "",
  "policy_impact": "The measure was amended to include a new section declaring that the appropriation will cause the state general fund expenditure ceiling for fiscal year 2024-2025 to be further exceeded. This addition, recommended by the Department of Budget and Finance, addresses constitutional and statutory requirements for appropriations that surpass the established ceiling. The effective date has also been changed to July 1, 3000, to encourage further discussion.",
  "revenue_sources": "Funding sources remain the state's general revenues, the state highway fund, and judiciary funds. However, the amount drawn from general revenues has been updated to $4,571,234.22 to account for newly added claims. The appropriations from the highway fund ($1,250,000) and judiciary funds ($90,000) are unchanged.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The fiscal implications are still confined to a one-time expenditure in fiscal year 2024-2025, but the total appropriation has increased to $5,911,234.22. The general fund portion of this one-time cost is now $4,571,234.22. The additional claims now involve payments for cases related to the Department of Defense ($275,000), Department of Education ($2,255,000), and Department of Law Enforcement ($750,000), among others. All other principles, such as the absence of recurring costs and the lapsing of unencumbered funds on June 30, 2026, remain the same.",

  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The primary update is the increase in the total appropriation from $5,664,734.22 to $5,911,234.22. This change is the result of amending the bill to include nine new claims totaling $3,572,898.47, which increased the general fund appropriation from $4,324,734.22 to $4,571,234.22. Consequently, the bill now explicitly involves additional agencies such as the Departments of Defense, Education, and Law Enforcement. A new clause has also been added to acknowledge that the appropriation exceeds the state general fund expenditure ceiling for FY 2024-2025."
