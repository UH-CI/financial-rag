  "overview": "This measure has been amended to formally incorporate four additional claims, finalizing appropriations for twenty-one claims against the State for fiscal year 2024-2025. The bill now allocates specific amounts from general revenues, the state highway fund, and judiciary funds. A key update is the bill's formal declaration that the state general fund expenditure ceiling has already been exceeded, and it establishes a lapse date of June 30, 2026 (HB990_HD2), for unexpended funds.",
  "appropriations": "The bill now formally appropriates `$5,158,867.07 (HB990_HD2)` from general revenues, `$1,250,000.00 (HB990_HD2)` from the state highway fund, and `$90,000.00 (HB990_HD2)` from judiciary funds for fiscal year 2024-2025. These appropriations reflect the incorporation of four new claims totaling `$587,632.85 (HB990_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_)` which were added to the general fund portion as requested by the Department of the Attorney General. The committee report confirms these claims were added to the bill (HB990_HD2_HSCR1146_).",

  "policy_impact": "The bill has been amended to include a formal legislative declaration that the state general fund expenditure ceiling for fiscal year 2024-2025 was already exceeded by `$8,551,795 (HB990_HD2)`. This codifies information that was previously provided only in testimony. Additionally, the measure now specifies an effective date of July 1, 3000 (HB990_HD2).",
  "revenue_sources": "The bill now formally codifies the funding sources for the claims. Appropriations are explicitly sourced from general revenues of the State of Hawaii for `$5,158,867.07 (HB990_HD2)`, the state highway fund for `$1,250,000.00 (HB990_HD2)`, and judiciary funds for `$90,000.00 (HB990_HD2)`. This allocation is now part of the official bill text.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The fiscal impact of this measure is a one-time appropriation for fiscal year 2024-2025 with no recurring costs. The bill now includes a specific provision stating that all unexpended and unencumbered balances from the appropriations made in the act shall lapse as of the close of business on June 30, 2026 (HB990_HD2). This addition ensures the financial impact is strictly limited and does not extend into future fiscal years. The appropriations consist of `$5,158,867.07 (HB990_HD2)` from the general fund, `$1,250,000.00 (HB990_HD2)` from the state highway fund, and `$90,000.00 (HB990_HD2)` from judiciary funds. As these are payments for settled claims and no new programs or positions are created, there are no further fiscal implications for the subsequent five years.",

A significant change is that the bill text now includes a formal declaration that the general fund expenditure ceiling was previously exceeded by `$8,551,795 (HB990_HD2)`. A specific lapse date for the appropriations has also been added, set for June 30, 2026 (HB990_HD2)."
