S.D. 1
Honorable Ronald D. Kouchi
President of the Senate
Thirty-Third State Legislature
Regular Session of 2025
State of Hawaii
Sir:
Your Committee on
Ways and Means, to which was referred H.B. No. 990, H.D. 2,
S.D. 1, entitled:
"A BILL FOR AN ACT MAKING APPROPRIATIONS FOR CLAIMS
AGAINST THE STATE, ITS OFFICERS, OR ITS EMPLOYEES,"
begs leave to report as follows:
The
purpose and intent of this measure is to make appropriations and approve
payments for claims against the State, state officers, and state employees.
Your Committee
received written comments in support of this measure from the Department of
Transportation, Department of Education, Attorney General, and Department of
Hawaiian Home Lands.
Your Committee finds
that appropriating moneys and authorizing the efficient settlement of claims will
promote financial responsibility and allow state agencies to focus on their core
missions.
As affirmed by the
record of votes of the members of your Committee on Ways and Means that is
attached to this report, your Committee is in accord with the intent and
purpose of H.B. No. 990, H.D. 2, S.D. 1, and recommends that it
pass Third Reading.
Respectfully submitted on behalf
of the members of the Committee on Ways and Means,
