  "overview": "House Bill 933 proposes a reduction of the general excise tax (GET) rate by one-half percent for two categories of goods: groceries eligible for purchase under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), and nonprescription drugs. The bill applies the reduced rate to all eligible grocery sales, regardless of the purchaser's program eligibility or method of payment. Additionally, the measure requires the Department of Business, Economic Development, and Tourism (DBEDT) to conduct and report on an economic cost-benefit analysis of these tax reductions.",
  "appropriations": "The provided legislative documents and testimonies do not specify any appropriations for this measure. No specific funding amounts are allocated for implementation or for the economic cost-benefit analysis to be conducted by DBEDT. The fiscal impact will primarily be a reduction in state revenue rather than a direct expenditure.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal projections are based on general assumptions about the impact of tax reductions on consumer costs and food security, supported by testimonies citing studies from other states. For example, a 2022 estimate by the Hawaii Department of Taxation director suggested that a full exemption for groceries could save taxpayers $268 million (HB933), although this bill only proposes a rate reduction. The bill mandates that DBEDT will conduct a formal economic cost-benefit analysis to establish a detailed methodology and calculate the precise financial impact.",
  "agency_impact": "The Department of Taxation (DOTAX) anticipates that the measure will complicate tax reporting for businesses, requiring them to track and report sales at different rates. DOTAX requested the effective date be moved to January 1, 2027, to allow sufficient time for necessary changes to tax forms, instructions, and taxpayer accounting systems. The Department of Business, Economic Development, and Tourism (DBEDT) will be impacted as it is tasked with conducting an economic cost-benefit analysis of the tax reductions.",
  "economic_impact": "The measure is expected to provide immediate financial relief to residents by addressing Hawaii's high cost of living, with one testimony estimating the current 4.5% GET adds $773 (HB933) annually to food costs for a family of four. By making essential goods more affordable, the bill aims to reduce food insecurity, which affects a significant portion of Hawaii's households. Testimonies suggest that similar tax policies in other states have led to job creation and increased economic output, such as in Georgia where a grocery tax exemption was estimated to create over 5,000 jobs and an additional $807 million (HB933) in economic output.",
  "policy_impact": "This bill modifies Hawaii's existing tax structure by creating a new, reduced GET rate for specific categories of goods, rather than providing a full exemption. It expands upon current exemptions, which already cover payments made with SNAP and WIC benefits and sales of prescription drugs. The measure broadens the tax relief to all sales of SNAP/WIC-eligible groceries and extends it to nonprescription drugs, reflecting a policy shift to reduce the tax burden on essential household items for all consumers.",
  "revenue_sources": "This measure does not create new revenue sources; instead, it reduces revenue from the state's General Excise Tax (GET). The GET is a primary source of funding for the state's General Fund. The reduction in the tax rate for groceries and nonprescription drugs will result in a decrease in these general fund revenues, and the provided documents do not identify any offsetting funding streams.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The primary fiscal implication over the next six years will be a recurring annual reduction in General Fund revenue due to the lower GET rate on eligible groceries and nonprescription drugs. The exact amount of this revenue loss is not quantified in the provided documents, but a prior estimate for a full grocery exemption was $268 million (HB933) annually, suggesting the impact of this one-half percent reduction will be significant. The Department of Taxation (DOTAX) will incur administrative costs to implement the changes, including updating forms, instructions, and computer systems. The Department of Business, Economic Development, and Tourism (DBEDT) will also incur costs to conduct the mandated economic cost-benefit analysis. DOTAX has requested delaying the implementation until January 1, 2027, which would push the start of the revenue loss further into the six-year window. The cost savings for consumers are intended to stimulate economic activity, which could partially offset the direct revenue loss over time. However, the net fiscal impact on the state budget remains a recurring reduction in revenue for the foreseeable future.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The measure will have a direct negative impact on the state's operating revenue. By reducing the general excise tax rate by one-half percent on a broad category of consumer goods (SNAP/WIC-eligible groceries and nonprescription drugs), the bill will decrease the total amount of tax collections. This will result in a recurring loss of revenue for the state's General Fund.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The provided documents do not specify any capital expenditures associated with this measure. While the Department of Taxation noted the need to update its systems to accommodate the new tax rates, these costs are not detailed or categorized as capital investments. Therefore, no significant capital expenditures are anticipated based on the available information.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "After the initial six-year period, the fiscal implications are expected to be a permanent and ongoing reduction in General Fund revenue. The tax rate reduction is not temporary and has no sunset clause, meaning the annual revenue loss will continue indefinitely unless the law is amended. The sustainability of this fiscal impact will depend on the state's overall economic condition and future budgetary priorities.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "No previous fiscal note was provided in the context documents."
