  "overview": "H.B. No. 933 reduces the general excise tax (GET) rate on the proceeds received from the sale of groceries eligible for purchase under the supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP) and special supplemental nutrition program for women, infants, and children (WIC), regardless of the means of purchase and the eligibility of the purchaser. The bill also imposes a reduced GET rate on the gross proceeds or income received from the sale of nonprescription drugs. Additionally, the measure requires the Department of Business, Economic Development, and Tourism (DBEDT) to conduct an economic cost-benefit analysis on the general excise tax reductions.",
  "appropriations": "The provided legislative documents and testimonies do not specify any appropriations for this measure. No funding is allocated for staffing, training, contracts, or technology. The bill focuses on tax rate reductions rather than direct spending.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The documents do not provide a detailed methodology for calculating the financial projections of this measure. The bill requires the Department of Business, Economic Development, and Tourism to conduct an economic cost-benefit analysis on the bill’s general excise tax reductions for calendar year 2026, to be submitted prior to the 2027 regular session. The Hawaii Department of Taxation director estimated in 2022 that exempting groceries from the general excise tax could save taxpayers $268 million (HB933).",
  "agency_impact": "The Department of Taxation (DOTAX) notes that the measure may complicate reporting for taxpayers and businesses, who will need to track and report receipts of sales subject to the proposed reduced rates separately. DOTAX requests the measure take effect on January 1, 2027 to allow for form and instruction changes and for businesses to update their accounting systems. The Department of Business, Economic Development, and Tourism (DBEDT) is required to conduct an economic cost-benefit analysis on the GET reductions.",
  "economic_impact": "Reducing the general excise tax on groceries and nonprescription drugs is intended to have an immediate positive effect on the cost of living by making these items more affordable. It is estimated that Hawai‘i’s 4.5% GET adds an estimated $773 per year in additional costs for a family of four under the USDA’s Thrifty Food Plan (HB933). A similar sales tax exemption for groceries in Georgia was estimated to have created more than 5,000 jobs and an additional $807 million in economic output (HB933).",
  "policy_impact": "This bill adds two new sections to chapter 237, Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS), to establish a reduced general excise tax rate for specific goods. The measure is intended to address the high cost of living in Hawaii and complements existing GET exemptions for prescription drugs and purchases made with SNAP benefits. The policy is described as less regressive, as it is intended to help low and middle-income individuals and families the hardest hit by the GET.",
  "revenue_sources": "The provided documents do not identify any new revenue sources to support this measure. The bill proposes a reduction in the general excise tax rate for certain goods. This will result in a decrease in revenue collected for the state's general fund.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The six-year fiscal implication of this measure is a recurring reduction in state general fund revenues due to the lower general excise tax (GET) rate on eligible groceries and nonprescription drugs. The measure has a proposed effective date of July 1, 2025 (HB933). However, the Department of Taxation (DOTAX) has requested the effective date be changed to January 1, 2027, to allow time for implementation, which would delay the fiscal impact. The Department of Business, Economic Development, and Tourism (DBEDT) is required to conduct an economic cost-benefit analysis for calendar year 2026, which will provide more detailed financial projections before the 2027 legislative session. While the exact revenue loss is not specified for this bill's proposed rate reduction, the Hawaii Department of Taxation director estimated in 2022 that fully exempting groceries from the GET could save taxpayers $268 million (HB933), indicating a substantial potential impact on state revenues. This reduction in GET collections would be ongoing and permanent, affecting the state's budget in each of the six years and beyond. The bill does not include a sunset clause, so the fiscal implications are expected to continue indefinitely. The administrative costs for DOTAX to implement these changes would be incurred in the fiscal years leading up to the effective date. Businesses would also incur costs to update their accounting systems to comply with the new dual-rate structure.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "This measure will reduce the state's operating revenue. The bill reduces the general excise tax rate by one-half percent for groceries eligible under SNAP and WIC and for nonprescription drugs. This will directly decrease the amount of tax revenue collected by the state from the sale of these goods.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The provided documents do not indicate any capital expenditures related to this measure. No investments in facilities, equipment, or technology infrastructure are mentioned. The primary costs are administrative and related to changes in tax forms and systems.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The fiscal implications after six years will be an ongoing annual reduction in general excise tax revenue for the State of Hawaii. As the proposed GET rate reductions are not subject to a sunset clause, the lower tax collections on eligible groceries and nonprescription drugs will be permanent. The continued impact on state revenues will depend on future sales volumes of these goods.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "No previous fiscal note was provided in the context documents. Therefore, a summary of updates cannot be generated."
