  "overview": "The purpose of this Act is to establish a reduction in the general excise tax rate on gross proceeds or income from the sale of groceries that are eligible for purchase under the supplemental nutrition assistance program or special supplemental nutrition program for women, infants, and children and from the sale of nonprescription drugs. [1] This bill reduces the general excise tax rate on the gross proceeds or income from the sale of such groceries, regardless of the means of purchase and the program eligibility of the purchaser. [1] It also requires the department of business, economic development and tourism to conduct an economic cost-benefit analysis on the general excise reductions and submit a report to the legislature. [1]",
  "appropriations": "The provided legislative documents do not specify any appropriations for this measure. [1] No funding amounts for staffing, training, or other operational costs are detailed in the bill. [1] Therefore, there are no specific appropriations to report. [1]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The bill's premise is based on the finding that the cost of living in Hawaii is extremely high. [1] It references a United States Department of Agriculture statistic that a Hawaii family on a thrifty food plan spends $1,794.60 (HB933_.HTM.txt) per month on food. [1] Based on this, the bill assumes this family would pay over $800 (HB933_.HTM.txt) a year in state taxes on those groceries. [1]",
  "agency_impact": "The department of business, economic development, and tourism is required to conduct an economic cost-benefit analysis on the general excise tax reductions for calendar year 2026. [1] This department shall submit a report of its findings from the analysis, including any recommendations and proposed legislation, to the legislature before the regular session of 2027. [1] The Department of Taxation will be impacted by the need to implement and administer a new reduced tax rate for specific goods. [1]",
  "economic_impact": "Lowering the tax rate on groceries and nonprescription drugs will have an immediate positive impact on Hawaii's cost of living by lowering the cost of these necessary items. [1] The legislature finds that taxing the sale of groceries is generally considered regressive and disproportionately hurts working families because they spend a higher percentage of their income on food. [1] A 2021 study by the University of Hawaii at Manoa stated that forty-eight per cent of Hawaii families with children are experiencing food insecurity. [1]",
  "policy_impact": "This Act amends Chapter 237, Hawaii Revised Statutes, by adding two new sections to establish a reduced general excise tax rate for eligible groceries and nonprescription drugs. [1] The tax rate will be one-half per cent less than the rate that would have applied pursuant to section 237-13. [1] This policy recognizes that certain items should have a lower tax burden, similar to the existing general exemption for amounts received by certain entities for selling prescription drugs. [1]",
  "revenue_sources": "The bill does not identify any new revenue sources to support the program or offset the tax reduction. [1] The reduction in the general excise tax will result in a decrease in revenue for the State's general fund. [1] No grants, fees, or other revenue streams are mentioned in the provided text. [1]",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "Beginning January 1, 2026, the State will collect a tax equivalent to one-half per cent less than the standard rate on the sale of eligible groceries. [1] A tax equivalent to one-half per cent less than the standard rate will also be collected on the sale of nonprescription drugs, also beginning January 1, 2026. [1] This will result in a recurring loss of general fund revenue for the foreseeable future. [1] The exact fiscal impact is undetermined, but the bill provides an example from the United States Department of Agriculture, where a Hawaii family on a thrifty food plan spends $1,794.60 (HB933_.HTM.txt) per month on food. [1] This family would pay over $800 (HB933_.HTM.txt) a year in state taxes on those groceries, indicating the potential scale of the tax reduction's impact on an individual basis. [1] Even with the refundable food/excise tax credit, a family would likely get back less than one-half of those state taxes paid on groceries. [1] The department of business, economic development, and tourism is required to conduct an economic cost-benefit analysis on the general excise tax reductions for calendar year 2026. [1] A report with findings and recommendations is to be submitted to the legislature prior to the convening of the regular session of 2027. [1] This report should provide a clearer picture of the long-term fiscal implications. [1] The Act itself is scheduled to take effect on July 1, 2025. [1]",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "This measure will reduce the State's operating revenue. [1] Beginning January 1, 2026, there shall be assessed and collected a tax equivalent to one-half per cent less than the rate that would have applied on the gross proceeds from the sale of eligible groceries and nonprescription drugs. [1] This reduction in the general excise tax rate will decrease tax collections from these sales. [1]",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The provided legislative documents do not mention any capital expenditures. [1] There are no anticipated investments in facilities, equipment, or technology infrastructure associated with this measure. [1] Therefore, there is no expected capital expenditure impact. [1]",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The fiscal implications are expected to be ongoing as the bill does not include a sunset clause for the tax reduction. [1] The reduced tax rate on eligible groceries and nonprescription drugs will continue indefinitely, resulting in a permanent reduction of general fund revenues. [1] The long-term fiscal impact will depend on the volume of sales of these specific goods in the state. [1]",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "No previous fiscal note was provided for comparison. [1]"
