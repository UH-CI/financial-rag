  "overview": "The purpose of this measure is to establish a reduction in the general excise tax rate on gross proceeds or gross income from the sale of groceries that are eligible for purchase under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children and from the sale of nonprescription drugs. This measure has been amended by changing the effective date to July 1, 3000, to encourage further discussion (HB933_HD1_HSCR59_.HTM.txt). The bill also requires the Department of Business, Economic Development, and Tourism to conduct an economic cost-benefit analysis on the general excise reductions and submit a report to the Legislature.",
  "appropriations": "",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "According to the United States Department of Agriculture, a Hawaii family on a thrifty food plan spends $1,794.60 (HB933_HD1_.HTM.txt) per month on food. This family would pay over $800 (HB933_HD1_.HTM.txt) a year in state taxes on those groceries. The thrifty food plan represents those on a limited budget (HB933_HD1_.HTM.txt).",
  "agency_impact": "The amended bill specifies the reduced tax rate would begin January 1, 2026 (HB933_HD1_.HTM.txt). However, the Committee on Human Services & Homelessness notes the request in testimony from the Department of Taxation that this measure take effect on January 1, 2027, rather than January 1, 2026 (HB933_HD1_HSCR59_.HTM.txt). This would allow the Department sufficient time to implement the proposed reduced rates and provide businesses with enough time to update their accounting systems (HB933_HD1_HSCR59_.HTM.txt).",
  "economic_impact": "The legislature finds that a Hawaii family on a thrifty food plan spends $1,794.60 (HB933_HD1_.HTM.txt) per month on food and this family would pay over $800 (HB933_HD1_.HTM.txt) a year in state taxes on those groceries. Lowering the tax rate on groceries and nonprescription drugs will have an immediate positive impact on Hawaii's cost of living by lowering the cost of these necessary items (HB933_HD1_.HTM.txt). Georgiaâ€™s phased elimination of grocery taxes in the 1990s resulted in $691.40 (HB933_TESTIMONY_HSH_01-30-25_.PDF.txt) million in household savings, 18,577 new jobs, and $1.45 (HB933_TESTIMONY_HSH_01-30-25_.PDF.txt) billion in economic output by 2021.",
  "policy_impact": "This Act amends Chapter 237, Hawaii Revised Statutes, by adding two new sections to establish a reduced general excise tax rate on eligible groceries and nonprescription drugs, beginning January 1, 2026 (HB933_HD1_.HTM.txt). The measure's effective date has been changed to July 1, 3000, to encourage further discussion (HB933_HD1_HSCR59_.HTM.txt). This change defers the implementation of the policy indefinitely.",
  "revenue_sources": "",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The fiscal implications of this measure have been significantly altered by amendments. While the text of the bill establishes a reduced tax rate beginning January 1, 2026 (HB933_HD1_.HTM.txt), the Committee on Human Services & Homelessness amended the measure by changing the effective date to July 1, 3000, to encourage further discussion (HB933_HD1_HSCR59_.HTM.txt). As a result, the measure will have no fiscal impact within the next six years. The original effective date of July 1, 2025, has been superseded. The Committee noted the Department of Taxation's request for a January 1, 2027 effective date to allow for implementation. However, the current effective date of July 1, 3000, makes this point moot for immediate fiscal planning. Therefore, there are no projected revenue reductions or administrative costs for implementation within the six-year fiscal planning period.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "Due to the amended effective date of July 1, 3000 (HB933_HD1_HSCR59_.HTM.txt), there is no anticipated impact on operating revenues. The reduction in the general excise tax rate will not take effect. The bill's internal start date for the tax reduction is January 1, 2026 (HB933_HD1_.HTM.txt), but this is nullified by the overall effective date.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "As the measure's effective date has been changed to July 1, 3000 (HB933_HD1_HSCR59_.HTM.txt), there are no fiscal implications after the six-year period. This amendment was made to encourage further discussion on the matter. Any future fiscal impact is contingent on subsequent legislation to amend the effective date.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The primary update is the change in the bill's effective date to July 1, 3000 (HB933_HD1_HSCR59_.HTM.txt), which defers any fiscal impact indefinitely and is intended to encourage further discussion. The implementation date for the tax reduction within the bill's text is now January 1, 2026 (HB933_HD1_.HTM.txt). The amended legislative document also introduces new figures, stating a Hawaii family on a thrifty food plan spends $1,794.60 (HB933_HD1_.HTM.txt) per month on food and would pay over $800 (HB933_HD1_.HTM.txt) a year in state taxes on those groceries."
