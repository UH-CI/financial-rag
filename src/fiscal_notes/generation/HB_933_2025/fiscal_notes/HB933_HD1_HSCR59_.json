  "overview": "While the purpose of House Bill 933 remains to reduce the general excise tax on certain groceries and nonprescription drugs, it has been significantly amended. The bill text now specifies a January 1, 2026 (HB933_HD1), start date for the tax reduction. However, the measure's overall effective date has been changed to July 1, 3000 (HB933_HD1), a procedural move to encourage further discussion and defer implementation.",
  "appropriations": "",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The revised bill text specifies that a Hawaii family on a thrifty food plan spends $1,794.60 (HB933_HD1) per month on food, which equates to over $800 (HB933_HD1) per year in state taxes on groceries. The mandated economic cost-benefit analysis by the Department of Business, Economic Development, and Tourism is now directed to cover calendar year 2026 (HB933_HD1). These figures provide a more specific basis for analysis than the general estimates previously cited.",
  "agency_impact": "A conflict in the implementation timeline has been introduced, as House Draft 1 sets a start date of January 1, 2026 (HB933_HD1) for the reduced tax rate. The committee report on this draft acknowledges that the Department of Taxation continues to request a later date of January 1, 2027 (HB933_HD1_HSCR59_), to allow for necessary system and form updates. The bill's new effective date of July 1, 3000 (HB933_HD1), currently makes this implementation timeline moot.",
  "economic_impact": "New testimony provides more detailed figures regarding the economic impact of similar policies, citing that Georgia's grocery tax exemption led to $691.4 million (HB933_TESTIMONY_HSH_01-30-25_) in household savings and $1.45 billion (HB933_TESTIMONY_HSH_01-30-25_) in economic output. This offers a more specific quantitative example of potential benefits. The bill now directly references that a family could pay over $800 (HB933_HD1) annually in grocery taxes, highlighting the potential for direct consumer savings.",
  "policy_impact": "The most significant policy update is the amendment changing the bill's effective date to July 1, 3000 (HB933_HD1), which serves to halt the measure's immediate progress and stimulate further debate. This 'defective date' effectively pauses the tax reduction. Additionally, testimony provides new context by referencing Act 47, SLH 2024, which exempted certain healthcare goods and services, indicating a broader legislative trend of reducing taxes on essential items (HB933_TESTIMONY_HSH_01-30-25_).",
  "revenue_sources": "",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The amendment of the bill's effective date to July 1, 3000 (HB933_HD1), has eliminated any fiscal implications within the next six years. The previously anticipated reduction in General Fund revenue and administrative costs for implementation will not occur under the current version of the bill. All fiscal impacts are now contingent on future amendments that would set an earlier, viable effective date.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "There is no longer any anticipated impact on the state's operating revenue, as the bill's implementation is deferred indefinitely with the new effective date of July 1, 3000 (HB933_HD1). The previously projected recurring revenue loss from the General Fund will not materialize. Any future impact on revenue is dependent on subsequent legislative amendments to the effective date.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "Long-term fiscal implications are now entirely conditional on the legislature amending the bill to have an effective date earlier than July 1, 3000 (HB933_HD1). If the bill is amended to become law, the previously described ongoing reduction in General Fund revenue would apply. As it stands, there are no fiscal obligations after the six-year period.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The primary update is the bill's amendment to include a 'defective' effective date of July 1, 3000 (HB933_HD1), which postpones all fiscal impacts to encourage further legislative discussion. The bill now contains a specific implementation date of January 1, 2026 (HB933_HD1), though this is non-binding given the overall effective date. New financial details include the bill's claim that a family may pay over $800 (HB933_HD1) annually in grocery taxes and updated testimony citing Georgia's tax exemption resulted in $691.4 million (HB933_TESTIMONY_HSH_01-30-25_) in savings and a $1.45 billion (HB933_TESTIMONY_HSH_01-30-25_) economic output."
