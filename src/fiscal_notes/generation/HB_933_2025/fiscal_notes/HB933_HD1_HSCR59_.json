  "overview": "The amended measure changes the effective date to July 1, 3000, to encourage further discussion. [4] As amended, the bill reduces the general excise tax rate on the gross proceeds or income from the sale of certain groceries and nonprescription drugs. [3] It also requires the Department of Business, Economic Development, and Tourism to conduct an economic cost-benefit analysis on the general excise reductions. [4]",
  "appropriations": "",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "Testimony from the Hawaii Food Industry Association states Hawai‘i’s 4.5% GET adds an estimated $773 (HB933_TESTIMONY_HSH_01-30-25_.PDF.txt) per year in additional costs for a family of four under the USDA’s Thrifty Food Plan. [2] In 2022, testimony indicates the Hawaii Department of Taxation director estimated that exempting groceries from the general excise tax could save taxpayers $268 million (HB933_TESTIMONY_HSH_01-30-25_.PDF.txt). [2]",
  "agency_impact": "The Department of Taxation (DOTAX) notes that the measure may complicate reporting for taxpayers and businesses, who will likely need to track and report receipts of sales subject to the proposed reduced rates separately from sales subject to the normal 4% rate. [2] DOTAX also requests the measure take effect on January 1, 2027 to allow for form and instruction changes necessary to implement the proposed reduced rates. [2] This would also allow taxpayers and businesses to update their accounting systems to comply with the changes in this measure. [2]",
  "economic_impact": "Testimony from the Grassroot Institute of Hawaii suggests the bill would have broader benefits, citing a Georgia state auditor estimate that Georgia’s sales tax exemption for groceries created more than 5,000 jobs and an additional economic output of $807 million (HB933_TESTIMONY_HSH_01-30-25_.PDF.txt). [2] Testimony from the Hawaii Food Industry Association states Georgia’s phased elimination of grocery taxes in the 1990s resulted in household savings of $691.4 million (HB933_TESTIMONY_HSH_01-30-25_.PDF.txt) and economic output of $1.45 billion (HB933_TESTIMONY_HSH_01-30-25_.PDF.txt) by 2021. [2] Testimony also indicates that food insecurity is a growing crisis in Hawai‘i, with nearly 1 in 3 households struggling to access adequate food. [2]",
  "policy_impact": "The Committee on Human Services & Homelessness has amended this measure by changing the effective date to July 1, 3000, to encourage further discussion. [4] This change affects the immediate policy implications of the bill, positioning it as a vehicle for future consideration rather than immediate implementation. [4] The core policy of establishing a reduced GET rate for certain groceries and nonprescription drugs remains the central purpose of the measure. [4]",
  "revenue_sources": "",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "While the reduction in the general excise tax rate is scheduled to begin on January 1, 2026, the act's new effective date is July 1, 3000. [3] The Department of Taxation submitted testimony requesting that the measure take effect on January 1, 2027, rather than January 1, 2026. [4] This would allow the Department sufficient time to implement the proposed reduced rates for the sale of eligible groceries and nonprescription drugs. [4] It would also provide businesses with enough time to update their accounting systems to comply with the changes proposed by this measure. [4]",

  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The change in the effective date to July 1, 3000, indicates the measure is intended to encourage further discussion, making the long-term fiscal implications dependent on future legislative action. [4]",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The primary update is the amended effective date of the bill to July 1, 3000, to encourage further discussion. [4] The Department of Taxation provided new testimony requesting the implementation of the reduced tax rates be delayed until January 1, 2027, to allow for necessary administrative and system updates. [2] New testimony also provided additional economic data points, such as an estimate from public testimony that exempting groceries could save taxpayers $268 million (HB933_TESTIMONY_HSH_01-30-25_.PDF.txt) and that a similar exemption in Georgia resulted in an additional $807 million (HB933_TESTIMONY_HSH_01-30-25_.PDF.txt) in economic output.
