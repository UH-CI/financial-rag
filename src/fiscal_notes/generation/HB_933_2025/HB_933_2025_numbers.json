The combination of inflation, supply chain disruptions, and the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated food insecurity, leaving nearly 30% of households food insecure in 2023, according to the Hawai‘i Foodbank. On Hawai‘i Island, the situation is even more dire, with The Food Basket reporting a food insecurity rate of 40%. Under these circumstances, taxing food is both unethical and unnecessary. Grocery taxes disproportionately burden low- and middle-income families, exacerbating economic hardship and worsening food insecurity. Hawai‘i’s 4.5% GET adds an estimated $773 per year in additional costs for a family of four under the USDA’s Thrifty Food Plan. For many residents, this is the difference between putting food on the table and going hungry. HAWAII FOOD INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION The Link Between Grocery Taxes and Food Insecurity Decades of research confirm that grocery taxes directly contribute to higher rates of food insecurity: • A 2021 study by Cornell University found that even small increases in grocery taxes significantly increase the likelihood of food insecurity among low-income households. • The Food Research & Action Center (FRAC) found that states with grocery taxes of 4%",

In recent years, multiple states have taken action: • Kansas began phasing out its 6.5% food tax in 2023, reducing it to 4% in 2024, with a plan to eliminate it entirely by 2025. • Alabama and Virginia have also reduced or eliminated grocery taxes, implementing phased approaches to balance budgetary needs while providing immediate relief to residents. • Georgia’s phased elimination of grocery taxes in the 1990s resulted in $691.4 million in household savings, 18,577 new jobs, and $1.45 billion in economic output by 2021. These examples show that states can remove grocery taxes without jeopardizing their budgets, while simultaneously reducing food insecurity and boosting economic activity. Health and Social Consequences of Grocery Taxes Taxing groceries and essential medicines contributes to worse health outcomes, particularly among children and vulnerable populations: • Higher rates of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease as families rely on lower-cost, less nutritious foods. • Increased healthcare costs due to the long-term impacts of food insecurity. • Negative effects on childhood development, education, and mental health due",
