RE:
H.B. No. 933
H.D.
1
Honorable Nadine K. Nakamura
Speaker, House of Representatives
Thirty-Third State Legislature
Regular Session of 2025
State of Hawaii
Madame:
Your Committee on Human
Services & Homelessness, to which was referred H.B. No. 933 entitled:
"A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO GENERAL EXCISE TAX
REDUCTIONS,"
begs leave to report as follows:
The
purpose of this measure is to:
(1)
Establish a reduction
in the general excise tax rate on gross proceeds or gross income from the sale
of groceries that are eligible for purchase under the Supplemental Nutrition
Assistance Program or Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women,
Infants, and Children and from the sale of nonprescription drugs; and
(2)
Require the Department
of Business, Economic Development, and Tourism to conduct an economic
cost-benefit analysis on the general excise reductions and submit a report to
the Legislature.
Your Committee received testimony in support
of this measure from the Grassroot Institute of Hawaii; Hawai
ʻ
i
Foodbank; Hawai
ʻ
i
Pacific Health; Hawaii Food Industry Association; and Maui Chamber of Commerce.
Your Committee received comments on this
measure from the Department of Taxation and Tax Foundation of Hawaii.
Your Committee finds
that Hawaii's high cost of living forces many residents to struggle with basic
necessities, including food, housing, and medication.
Food insecurity remains a serious issue, with
nearly half of Hawaii families with children experiencing difficulty affording
enough to eat.
Unlike most states,
Hawaii taxes groceries at the full general excise tax rate, which
disproportionately burdens working families and those on limited budgets.
Reducing the general excise tax on groceries
and nonprescription drugs would provide immediate financial relief, helping
families afford essential items.
Your Committee has
amended this measure by:
(1)
Changing the effective date to July 1, 3000,
to encourage further discussion; and
(2)
Making technical, nonsubstantive amendments
for clarity, consistency, and style.
Your Committee notes the
request in testimony from the Department of Taxation that this measure take
effect on January 1, 2027, rather than January 1, 2026, to allow the Department
sufficient time to implement the proposed reduced rates for the sale of
eligible groceries and nonprescription drugs and provide businesses with enough
time to update their accounting systems to comply with the changes proposed by
this measure.
As affirmed by the
record of votes of the members of your Committee on Human Services &
Homelessness that is attached to this report, your Committee is in accord with
the intent and purpose of H.B. No. 933, as amended herein, and recommends that
it pass Second Reading in the form attached hereto as H.B. No. 933, H.D. 1, and
be referred to your Committee on Economic Development & Technology.
Respectfully
submitted on behalf of the members of the Committee on Human Services &
Homelessness,
