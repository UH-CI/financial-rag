Honorable Nadine K. Nakamura

Regular Session of 2025
State of Hawaii
Madame:
Your Committee on Housing,
to which was referred H.B. No. 431, H.D. 1, entitled:

begs leave to report as follows:
The

the Kauhale Initiative;

funds into and out of the Supportive Housing Special Fund; and

Your Committee received comments on this
measure from the Department of Budget and Finance and State Procurement Office.
Your Committee
finds that Hawaii faces a severe housing crisis, with a critical shortage of
affordable and supportive housing options for homeless individuals and those at
risk of homelessness.
Despite ongoing
efforts, the State continues to experience rising homelessness and insufficient
long-term housing solutions to meet the growing demand.
This measure is essential to strengthen the
State's capacity to work with developers in creating additional housing,
ensuring more sustainable and permanent solutions to address housing insecurity
and promote community stability.
Your Committee has
amended this measure by:
(1)
Expanding the authorized uses of funds
appropriated for the Kauhale Initiative;
(2)
Authorizing funds appropriated for the Kauhale
Initiative to be used for the Ohana Zones Pilot Program established under Act
209, Session Laws of Hawaii 2018;
(3)
Requiring at least two bidders for any kauhale
project estimated to be over $1,000,000 if appropriated funds are used to
contract for the procurement of building services and projects related to the
Kauhale Initiative;
(4)
Deleting the unspecified appropriation to the
Statewide Office on Homelessness and Housing Solutions to implement the Kauhale
Initiative; and
(5)
Making technical, nonsubstantive amendments
for the purposes of clarity, consistency, and style.
As affirmed by the
record of votes of the members of your Committee on Housing that is attached to
this report, your Committee is in accord with the intent and purpose of H.B.
No. 431, H.D. 1, as amended herein, and recommends that it be referred to your
Committee on Finance in the form attached hereto as H.B. No. 431, H.D. 2.
Respectfully
submitted on behalf of the members of the Committee on Housing,
