Currently, we have 18 Kauhale active across the state and have a goal to establish 30 kauhale villages by the end of 2026.

Our Kauhale communities’ pair personal spaces with shared living spaces, often envisioned as tiny homes communities or repurposed commercial, hotel, or apartment buildings, that respond to the unique needs of subpopulations experiencing homelessness. The model is built on the foundation of fostering community and responsibility among residents.

For these reasons, HB431 is laser focused toward building housing inventory to not only provide housing for homeless, but also our working individuals and families who may not yet be houseless, but are facing housing instability due to Hawaii's high costs of living. I suggest amending the bill to allow for no less than two (2) bids for any construction on housing projects over $1 million dollars. By having no less than two (2) bids this ensures fairness in the costs. With the stated amendment, I support HB431.

Unfortunately, this mandate is currently failing due to severe underfunding of necessary diversion infrastructure. The question often asked by law enforcement and judges is \"Divert to where?\". • We need significant investment in 24/7 supportive housing for justice involved individuals. Kauhale is a very cost effective solution, compare Kauhale cost of around $30,000 per person per year to $112,000/year to incarcerate a resident at OCCC). • Supportive housing improves public safety and health. A study by Partners in Care revealed that the recidivism rate for individuals in Hawai'i who received housing support was just 12.8% versus 50% without housing support. This demonstrates that individuals are far more likely to remain housed and avoid reoffending when provided stable housing and support through high impact investments such as Kauhale.

DHS requests an amendment and provides comments. DHS defers to the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation (HHFDC) and the Department of Budget & Finance on special funds and prefers that any appropriation align with and not reduce or replace budget priorities identified in the executive budget. DHS respectfully requests reconsideration of the amendment requiring at least two bids for Kauhale projects over $1 million. The administration has reconsidered this requested amendment, see page 6, lines 15-18, and clarifies that when an emergency proclamation is in effect related to homelessness and includes Kauhale or Ohana Zones pilot program projects, the developing agency may still consider more than one bid for any project. When there is no emergency proclamation in effect, these projects should follow the State Procurement Code or exemption provided by statute or session law. DHS is also concerned that the two-bid minimum may delay project development in certain communities if only one bid is received. February 23, 2025 Page 2 AN EQUAL",
