  "overview": "The proposed measure now appropriates funds for the Kauhale Initiative to the Office of the Governor, which is granted the authority to transfer these funds to designated executive branch agencies, including the Statewide Office on Homelessness and Housing Solutions. The scope of the Kauhale Initiative appropriation has been broadened to explicitly authorize funding for the Ohana Zones Pilot Program. The bill continues to establish the Supportive Housing Special Fund with an unspecified appropriation.",
  "appropriations": "The unspecified general fund appropriation for the Kauhale Initiative is now directed to the Office of the Governor instead of the Statewide Office on Homelessness and Housing Solutions. The authorized uses of these funds have been expanded, and the appropriation may now also be used for the Ohana Zones Pilot Program. A new procurement provision requires at least two bidders for any Kauhale project estimated to cost over $1,000,000.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "",
  "agency_impact": "Primary fiscal oversight for the Kauhale Initiative appropriation is shifted from the Statewide Office on Homelessness and Housing Solutions to the Office of the Governor. The Governor's office will now administer the appropriation and may transfer funds to SOHHS and other departments for program implementation. The impact on the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation, which will administer the new Supportive Housing Special Fund, remains consistent with the previous version.",
  "economic_impact": "",
  "policy_impact": "This measure centralizes the Kauhale Initiative's funding under the Office of the Governor, creating a flexible mechanism for allocating funds across various state agencies. It also formally merges the funding stream for the Ohana Zones Pilot Program into the broader Kauhale Initiative appropriation. Additionally, it introduces a new procurement policy for large Kauhale projects to ensure competitive bidding.",

  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The primary change from the previous version is the redirection of the Kauhale Initiative appropriation from the Statewide Office on Homelessness and Housing Solutions (SOHHS) to the Office of the Governor. The bill now explicitly allows these funds to be used for the Ohana Zones Pilot Program. A new procurement requirement has been added, mandating at least two bidders for Kauhale projects exceeding $1,000,000, and the separate appropriation to SOHHS has been removed."
