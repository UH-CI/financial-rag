  "overview": "This measure has been amended to authorize funds appropriated for the Kauhale Initiative to also be used for the Ohana Zones Pilot Program, merging funding for the two state-led homelessness initiatives. It continues to seek appropriations for the Kauhale Initiative and establishes the Supportive Housing Special Fund to be administered by the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation. A new provision requires at least two bidders for any Kauhale project estimated to cost over $1,000,000 (HB431_HD2).",

  "agency_impact": "The State Procurement Office has raised concerns about a provision exempting the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation (HHFDC) from chapter 103D, Hawaii Revised Statutes, when selecting partners for supportive housing projects (HB431_HD1_TESTIMONY_HSG_02-12-25_). Additionally, the measure was amended to remove a direct appropriation to the Statewide Office on Homelessness and Housing Solutions, instead appropriating funds to the Office of the Governor for transfer to designated agencies (HB431_HD2_HSCR765_). HHFDC testimony continues to support the establishment of one full-time equivalent (1.0 FTE) housing finance specialist I position to administer the new special fund (HB431_HD1_TESTIMONY_HSG_02-12-25_).",
  "economic_impact": "New testimony provides further data on the economic benefits of supportive housing, indicating it can lead to 33% fewer emergency room visits and 23% fewer days spent in hospitals (HB431_HD1_TESTIMONY_HSG_02-12-25_). Testimony also reiterates that supportive housing initiatives can reduce recidivism rates for justice-involved individuals from 50% to 12.8% (HB431_HD1_TESTIMONY_HSG_02-12-25_). These potential cost savings in healthcare and the justice system supplement the direct costs of the housing programs.",
  "policy_impact": "The measure now integrates two major state homelessness programs by allowing funds for the Kauhale Initiative to also be used for the Ohana Zones Pilot Program (HB431_HD2_HSCR765_). A new procurement policy has been added, requiring at least two bidders for any Kauhale project with an estimated cost over $1,000,000 (HB431_HD2). The policy to exempt the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation from chapter 103D for certain contracts remains in the bill, despite recommendations for its removal from the State Procurement Office (HB431_HD1_TESTIMONY_HSG_02-12-25_).",

For any Kauhale project estimated to be over $1,000,000 (HB431_HD2), there must be at least two bidders. This introduces a new competitive bidding requirement for significant capital projects under the initiative.",

  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The measure has been updated to consolidate funding streams, authorizing funds for the Kauhale Initiative to also be used for the Ohana Zones Pilot Program. A direct appropriation to the Statewide Office of Homelessness and Housing Solutions was removed in favor of an appropriation to the Governor's Office for transfer to relevant agencies (HB431_HD2_HSCR765_). New procurement rules were introduced, including a requirement for at least two bidders on Kauhale projects over $1,000,000 (HB431_HD2), while an exemption from procurement code for the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation drew critical testimony from the State Procurement Office (HB431_HD1_TESTIMONY_HSG_02-12-25_). Additional economic impact data was provided, highlighting potential healthcare cost savings (HB431_HD1_TESTIMONY_HSG_02-12-25_)."
