  "overview": "The purpose of this measure is to appropriate funds for the Kauhale Initiative and establish the Supportive Housing Special Fund. [7] This version of the measure expands the authorized uses of funds appropriated for the Kauhale Initiative. [7] It also authorizes funds appropriated for the Kauhale Initiative to be used for the Ohana Zones Pilot Program and deletes a previous unspecified appropriation to the Statewide Office on Homelessness and Housing Solutions. [7] [7]",
  "appropriations": "The measure was amended by deleting the unspecified appropriation to the Statewide Office on Homelessness and Housing Solutions to implement the Kauhale Initiative. [7] An unspecified amount of general funds is still appropriated to the office of the governor for the continued operation of the kauhale initiative for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027. [6] [6] The governor may transfer all or a portion of the appropriation to designated executive branch departments or agencies, including the statewide office on homelessness and housing solutions.

  "agency_impact": "This measure deletes the direct unspecified appropriation to the Statewide Office on Homelessness and Housing Solutions. [7] Instead, the governor's designated executive branch departments or agencies may expend any appropriation transferred from the office of the governor for the performance of their duties under the kauhale initiative. [6] [6] The bill requires at least two bidders for any kauhale project estimated to be over $1,000,000 (HB431_HD2_.HTM.txt) if funds are used to contract for the procurement of building services and projects.

  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The authorization for Kauhale Initiative funds to be used for the Ohana Zones Pilot Program established under Act 209, Session Laws of Hawaii 2018, merges the funding streams for two distinct homeless initiatives. [7] This could impact the financial tracking and future budgeting for each program individually. [7] The requirement for at least two bidders for any kauhale project estimated to be over $1,000,000 (HB431_HD2_.HTM.txt) may affect the timeline and costs for larger projects within the six-year period. [6] The bill continues to appropriate unspecified sums for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027. [6] The legislature finds that the ohana zones pilot program was previously extended through June 30, 2026, and was provided an additional $15,000,000 (HB431_HD2_.HTM.txt) to fund services under Act 235, Session Laws of Hawaii 2022. [6] The kauhale initiative has evolved to include temporary, time-limited options as well as long-term solutions. [6] There are no specified appropriations beyond fiscal year 2026-2027. [6] The establishment of a temporary full-time equivalent (1.0 FTE) housing finance specialist I position is for the biennium. [6]",

[6] This new requirement directly impacts the procurement process for capital projects related to the initiative. [6] This differs from the previous procurement exemption for the supportive housing special fund, which allows the corporation to be exempt from chapter 103D in selecting a qualified organization.
