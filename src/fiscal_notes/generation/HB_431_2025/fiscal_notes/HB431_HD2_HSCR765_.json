  "appropriations": "House Bill No. 431, H.D. 2, \"appropriates an unspecified amount of general funds in both FY 26 and FY 27 to the Office of the Governor for the continued operation of the Kauhale Initiative\" (HB431_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_.PDF.txt). The bill also \"appropriates an unspecified amount of general funds in both FY 26 and FY 27 for deposit into the SHSF and appropriates an unspecified amount of special fund ceiling for the SHSF in both FY 26 and FY 27 for HHFDC\" (HB431_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_.PDF.txt). The Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation (HHFDC) requests \"$175,000 (HB431_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_.PDF.txt) for one full-time equivalent (1.0 FTE) housing finance specialist I position needed to help administer the supportive housing special fund\" (HB431_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_.PDF.txt).",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "",
  "agency_impact": "The State Procurement Office (SPO) \"recommends that the procurement exemption language... be removed\" regarding the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation's (HHFDC) ability to be \"exempt from comply with chapter 103D in selecting a qualified private or nonprofit organization\" (HB431_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_.PDF.txt). The SPO states that exemptions mean procurements \"will not have the same oversight, accountability and transparency requirements mandated by those procurements processes provided in the code\" (HB431_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_.PDF.txt). HHFDC requests funding for a new position to help with the administration of the special fund, indicating an increase in administrative workload for the agency.",
  "economic_impact": "Testimony from the Office of Hawaiian Affairs states that \"people offered supportive housing spent 23 % fewer days in hospitals, had 33 % fewer emergency room visits, and spent 42 % fewer days in nursing homes over a year\" (HB431_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_.PDF.txt). Furthermore, testimony indicates supportive housing reduces recidivism, citing a study where \"the recidivism rate for individuals who received housing support was 12.8% versus 50% without housing support\" (HB431_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_.PDF.txt). The City and County of Honolulu Office of Housing notes that supportive housing \"lowers cost burdens on our public systems, including our healthcare and incarceration systems\" (HB431_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_.PDF.txt).",
  "policy_impact": "A significant policy change in this version of the measure is \"Deleting the unspecified appropriation to the Statewide Office on Homelessness and Housing Solutions to implement the Kauhale Initiative\" (HB431_HD2_HSCR765_.HTM.txt). This removes a direct funding allocation to that specific office that was present in a prior version. The bill also expands the scope of the Kauhale Initiative by authorizing its funds \"to be used for the Ohana Zones Pilot Program established under Act 209, Session Laws of Hawaii 2018\" (HB431_HD2_HSCR765_.HTM.txt).",
  "revenue_sources": "In addition to unspecified general fund appropriations, the Supportive Housing Special Fund may include revenue from other sources. The bill specifies that the fund may include \"private contributions, proceeds from repayment of loans, interest, fees, other returns, and moneys from other sources\" (HB431_HD2_.HTM.txt). Furthermore, the HHFDC is authorized to \"establish, revise, charge, and collect a reasonable service fee\" which \"shall be deposited into the supportive housing special fund\" (HB431_HD2_.HTM.txt).",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The bill appropriates unspecified sums for FY 2026 and FY 2027, continuing a history of significant state investment in homelessness initiatives. Previously, the legislature established the ohana zones pilot program which initially appropriated \"$30,000,000 (HB431_HD2_.HTM.txt) to fund nonprofit and county government programs\" (HB431_HD2_.HTM.txt). Subsequent legislation appropriated \"$2,000,000 (HB431_HD2_.HTM.txt) for the construction of modular temporary units\" (HB431_HD2_.HTM.txt) and later provided an additional \"$15,000,000 (HB431_HD2_.HTM.txt) to fund services\" (HB431_HD2_.HTM.txt). In 2023, the legislature also set aside \"$5,000,000 (HB431_HD2_.HTM.txt) to fund a supportive housing pilot program\" (HB431_HD2_.HTM.txt) and \"$25,000,000 (HB431_HD2_.HTM.txt) to fund the kauhale initiative\" (HB431_HD2_.HTM.txt). The creation of the Supportive Housing Special Fund signals a long-term funding mechanism. The request from HHFDC for \"$175,000 (HB431_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_.PDF.txt) for one full-time equivalent (1.0 FTE) housing finance specialist I position\" (HB431_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_.PDF.txt) represents a recurring administrative cost that will continue in subsequent fiscal years.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The measure is expected to generate operating revenue for the newly established Supportive Housing Special Fund. The bill specifies that the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation \"may establish, revise, charge, and collect a reasonable service fee, as necessary, in connection with its financing, services, and approvals under this subpart\" (HB431_HD2_.HTM.txt). These fees \"shall be deposited into the supportive housing special fund,\" creating a new revenue stream to support the fund's activities (HB431_HD2_.HTM.txt).",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The establishment of the Supportive Housing Special Fund is intended to create a permanent financing tool, implying ongoing fiscal commitments beyond the initial six-year period. These commitments would include continued appropriations to sustain the fund's activities, such as financing housing projects and providing supportive services. Additionally, administrative costs, such as the full-time position requested by HHFDC, are expected to be recurring annual expenses necessary for the fund's continued operation.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "This fiscal note differs from the previous version by including new agency feedback and policy changes. A key update is the deletion of the specific, albeit unspecified, appropriation to the Statewide Office on Homelessness and Housing Solutions, which was present in a prior draft. New testimony from the State Procurement Office raises concerns about a procurement exemption for HHFDC, an issue not previously noted. This update also provides new details on revenue sources, specifically identifying that service fees collected by HHFDC will be deposited into the special fund, and includes new testimony on potential economic impacts, such as reduced healthcare costs and recidivism rates."
