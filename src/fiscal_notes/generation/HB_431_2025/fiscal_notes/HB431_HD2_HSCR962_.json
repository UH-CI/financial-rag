[8] The bill appropriates an unspecified amount of general funds in both FY 26 and FY 27 to the Office of the Governor for the continued operation of the Kauhale Initiative. [8] It also appropriates an unspecified amount of general funds in both FY 26 and FY 27 for deposit into the Supportive Housing Special Fund and an unspecified amount of special fund ceiling for the SHSF in both FY 26 and FY 27 for HHFDC.

  "assumptions_and_methodology": "",
  "agency_impact": "The Department of Human Services (DHS) requests reconsideration of the amendment requiring at least two bids for Kauhale projects over $1,000,000 (HB431_HD2_.HTM.txt). [8] DHS is concerned that the two-bid minimum may delay project development in certain communities if only one bid is received and respectfully requests that the provision be deleted. [8] [8] The State Procurement Office (SPO) recommends that the procurement exemption language exempting the corporation from chapter 103D in selecting a qualified private or nonprofit organization be removed. [8] The Department of Budget and Finance does not support the creation of any special fund which does not meet the requirements of Section 37-52.3, HRS, and finds it is difficult to determine whether the proposed SHSF would be self-sustaining. [8] [8]",
  "economic_impact": "The center for budget and policy priorities found that people offered supportive housing spent 23 % fewer days in hospitals, had 33 % fewer emergency room visits, and spent 42 % fewer days in nursing homes over a year. [8] A study by Hawaii based organization Partners in Care revealed that the recidivism rate for individuals who received housing support was 12.8% versus 50% without housing support. [8] Supportive housing is a highly effective housing intervention that lowers cost burdens on public systems, including healthcare and incarceration systems. [8]",
  "policy_impact": "The State Procurement Office has raised concerns that exemptions to the Hawaii Procurement Code mean procurements made with taxpayer monies will not have the same oversight, accountability and transparency requirements mandated by the code. [8] The Department of Budget and Finance (B&F) stated as a matter of general policy it does not support the creation of any special fund which does not meet the requirements of Section 37-52.3, HRS. [8] B&F also stated it is difficult to determine whether the proposed SHSF would be self-sustaining. [8]",
  "revenue_sources": "The Supportive Housing Special Fund may include sums appropriated by the legislature, private contributions, proceeds from repayment of loans, interest, fees, other returns, and moneys from other sources. [7] The corporation may establish, revise, charge, and collect a reasonable service fee, as necessary, in connection with its financing, services, and approvals under this subpart. [7] The fees shall be deposited into the supportive housing special fund. [7]",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The bill establishes one temporary full-time equivalent (1.0 FTE) housing finance specialist I position within the Hawaii housing finance and development corporation. [7] HHFDC requests $175,000 (HB431_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_.PDF.txt) for this position, which would represent a recurring annual cost. [8] The bill appropriates an unspecified amount of general funds in both FY 26 and FY 27 for the continued operation of the Kauhale Initiative and for deposit into the Supportive Housing Special Fund. [8] [8] According to the Department of Budget and Finance, it is difficult to determine whether the proposed Supportive Housing Special Fund would be financially self-sustaining in the long term. [8] The bill's effective dates of June 29, 3000, and July 1, 3000, were established to encourage further discussion. [8]",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "A new revenue stream may be created, as the corporation may establish, revise, charge, and collect a reasonable service fee in connection with its financing and services. [7] These fees shall be deposited into the supportive housing special fund. [7] The fund may also include proceeds from repayment of loans, interest, fees, and other returns as revenue sources. [7]",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The Department of Human Services (DHS) respectfully requests that the provision regarding at least two bidders for a Kauhale project estimated to be over $1,000,000 (HB431_HD2_.HTM.txt) be deleted. [8] DHS is concerned that the two-bid minimum may delay project development in certain communities if only one bid is received. [8]",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The Department of Budget and Finance stated that it is difficult to determine whether the proposed Supportive Housing Special Fund would be self-sustaining. [8] The fund's ability to be self-sustaining will depend on revenue from sources such as appropriated sums, contributions, loan repayments, interest, and fees. [7]",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "A new funding request has been specified by HHFDC, which requests $175,000 (HB431_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_.PDF.txt) for one FTE position to administer the new special fund. [8] New agency feedback has been received, including a request from DHS to delete the two-bidder requirement for projects over $1,000,000 (HB431_HD2_.HTM.txt), an objection from the State Procurement Office to a procurement exemption, and concerns from the Department of Budget and Finance regarding the long-term sustainability of the special fund. [8] [8] [8] New economic data indicates supportive housing may reduce hospital visits and recidivism. [8] [8] Specific revenue sources for the Supportive Housing Special Fund, including service fees and loan repayments, are now detailed. [7] [7]"
