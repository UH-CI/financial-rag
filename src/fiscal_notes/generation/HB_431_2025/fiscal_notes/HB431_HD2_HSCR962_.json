  "overview": "This measure is advancing through the legislature with its core provisions intact, including appropriations for the Kauhale Initiative and the creation of the Supportive Housing Special Fund. The House Committee on Finance has recommended the bill pass Third Reading, despite new testimony from state agencies requesting changes to key provisions. The bill continues to appropriate unspecified amounts for fiscal years 2026 and 2027 from general funds.",
  "appropriations": "The Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation (HHFDC) testimony requests $175,000 (HB431_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_) for one full-time equivalent housing finance specialist position to administer the new special fund. The bill appropriates unspecified general fund amounts in both FY 26 and FY 27 to the Office of the Governor for the Kauhale Initiative (HB431_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_). It also appropriates an unspecified amount of general funds in both FY 26 and FY 27 for deposit into the Supportive Housing Special Fund (HB431_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_).",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The Department of Budget and Finance has introduced a new consideration, stating it is difficult to determine whether the proposed Supportive Housing Special Fund would be self-sustaining, which is a requirement for special funds under Section 37-52.3, HRS (HB431_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_). This questions the underlying financial assumption of the new fund. The 2024 Point-in-Time Count is cited as a data source, reporting 6,389 individuals experiencing homelessness statewide (HB431_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_).",
  "agency_impact": "The Department of Human Services (DHS) has formally requested the deletion of the requirement for at least two bidders on Kauhale projects over $1,000,000 (HB431_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_), arguing it could delay project development. However, the House Committee on Finance recommended the bill pass without this requested amendment (HB431_HD2_HSCR962_). Additionally, the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation specified that its request for one new position would require an appropriation of $175,000 (HB431_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_).",
  "economic_impact": "New testimony highlights that supportive housing can increase engagement in substance abuse treatment, with studies showing 50-60% of individuals in Housing First programs voluntarily participating when supportive services are offered (HB431_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_). This indicates potential for improved health outcomes and reduced reliance on other public services. The 2024 Point-in-Time count provides updated statistics, including 654 homeless individuals on Maui and 718 on Hawaii Island (HB431_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_).",
  "policy_impact": "A key policy development is the formal opposition from the Department of Human Services (DHS) to the two-bidder requirement for Kauhale projects over $1,000,000 (HB431_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_), creating a point of contention within the administration. The Department of Budget and Finance has also raised policy objections to the creation of the Supportive Housing Special Fund, stating that it may not meet statutory requirements for financial self-sustainability (HB431_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_). Despite these concerns, the bill advanced from the House Finance Committee without changes to these provisions (HB431_HD2_HSCR962_).",
  "revenue_sources": "Testimony from the Department of Budget and Finance clarifies that the measure appropriates an unspecified amount of general funds in both FY 26 and FY 27 for the Kauhale Initiative. It also appropriates an unspecified amount of general funds for the same fiscal years for deposit into the new Supportive Housing Special Fund (SHSF) (HB431_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_). The testimony raises concerns about whether the SHSF will be financially self-sustaining as required for special funds (HB431_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_).",

  "operating_revenue_impact": "",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "While the previous version of the bill introduced a two-bidder requirement for Kauhale projects over $1,000,000 (HB431_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_), new testimony from the Department of Human Services formally requests that this provision be deleted. The department is concerned the requirement may delay project development, particularly in communities where only one bid is received (HB431_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_). The House Finance Committee did not adopt this requested change in its latest report (HB431_HD2_HSCR962_).",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "New testimony has specified the fiscal impact of staffing requests, with the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation requesting $175,000 (HB431_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_) for one new position. A significant policy conflict has emerged, as the Department of Human Services now formally opposes the two-bidder requirement for projects over $1,000,000 (HB431_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_), though the bill is advancing without that change. The Department of Budget and Finance has also raised new concerns about the self-sustainability of the proposed Supportive Housing Special Fund and confirmed its funding source is general funds (HB431_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_)."
