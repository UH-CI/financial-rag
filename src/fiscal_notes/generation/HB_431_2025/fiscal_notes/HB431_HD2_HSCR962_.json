  "overview": "The purpose of this measure is to appropriate funds for \"the continued implementation of the Kauhale Initiative\" and to \"Create the Supportive Housing Special Fund\" (HB431_HD2_HSCR962_). House Bill No. 431, H.D. 2, appropriates an unspecified amount of general funds for the Kauhale Initiative and establishes the Supportive Housing Special Fund (SHSF) to be administered by the Hawai‘i Housing Finance and Development Corporation (HHFDC) (HB431_HD2_TESTIMONY_HHS-HOU_03-12-25_). This version of the bill re-establishes the special fund, which was deleted in a previous iteration.",

  "agency_impact": "The Department of Budget and Finance (B&F) offers comments, stating that as a matter of general policy, it \"does not support the creation of any special fund, which does not meet the requirements of Section 37-52.3, HRS\" (HB431_HD2_TESTIMONY_HHS-HOU_03-12-25_). B&F also notes it is \"difficult to determine whether the proposed SHSF would be self-sustaining\" (HB431_HD2_TESTIMONY_HHS-HOU_03-12-25_). The Department of Human Services and the Statewide Office on Homelessness and Housing Solutions request that the provision \"requiring at least two bidders for a Kauhale project estimated cost of over $1 million be deleted\" (HB431_HD2_TESTIMONY_HHS-HOU_03-12-25_).",
  "economic_impact": "",
  "policy_impact": "This version of the measure represents a significant policy reversal from the one described in the previous fiscal note by re-establishing a special fund. The purpose of the bill is now to \"Create the Supportive Housing Special Fund\" to assist the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation (HB431_HD2_HSCR962_). The measure now authorizes funds appropriated for the Kauhale Initiative \"to be used for the Ohana Zones Pilot Program established under Act 209, Session Laws of Hawaii 2018\" (HB431_HD2_TESTIMONY_HHS-HOU_03-12-25_). This bill also includes a provision \"Requiring at least two bidders for any Kauhale project estimated to be over $1,000,000 (HB431_HD2_TESTIMONY_HHS-HOU_03-12-25_.PDF.txt)\" (HB431_HD2_TESTIMONY_HHS-HOU_03-12-25_).",
  "revenue_sources": "This measure appropriates an \"unspecified amount of general funds in both FY 26 and FY 27 for deposit into the SHSF\" (HB431_HD2_TESTIMONY_HHS-HOU_03-12-25_). It also appropriates an \"unspecified amount of special fund ceiling for the SHSF in both FY 26 and FY 27 for HHFDC\" (HB431_HD2_TESTIMONY_HHS-HOU_03-12-25_). The Supportive Housing Special Fund is intended as a \"new financing tool that will help HHFDC to facilitate the development of supportive housing units\" (HB431_HD2_TESTIMONY_HHS-HOU_03-12-25_).",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "Testimony from the Statewide Office on Homelessness and Housing Solutions states that the expansion of the Kauhale Initiative was made possible by the \"generous support of the Hawaiʻi State Legislature which appropriated $33 million for FY25 for kauhale initiatives\" (HB431_HD2_TESTIMONY_HHS-HOU_03-12-25_.PDF.txt). The current bill appropriates unspecified general funds for FY 26 and FY 27 to the Office of the Governor for the Kauhale Initiative (HB431_HD2_TESTIMONY_HHS-HOU_03-12-25_). It also establishes the Supportive Housing Special Fund with unspecified general fund deposits and special fund ceilings for FY 26 and FY 27, signaling ongoing costs (HB431_HD2_TESTIMONY_HHS-HOU_03-12-25_). The Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation's request for $175,000 (HB431_HD2_TESTIMONY_HHS-HOU_03-12-25_.PDF.txt) for one permanent full-time position indicates recurring administrative costs to manage the new special fund (HB431_HD2_TESTIMONY_HHS-HOU_03-12-25_). The establishment of a special fund, as opposed to direct appropriations, changes the long-term fiscal structure for funding these supportive housing projects.",

  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "This fiscal note is updated to reflect significant policy reversals from the previous version of the measure. The most substantial change is the reintroduction and creation of the Supportive Housing Special Fund, which was explicitly deleted in the version described in the prior fiscal note. This version also re-authorizes the use of Kauhale Initiative funds for the Ohana Zones Pilot Program. Finally, this measure introduces a procurement requirement for projects over $1,000,000 (HB431_HD2_TESTIMONY_HHS-HOU_03-12-25_.PDF.txt), a provision that was absent from the previous version and is now being contested by state agencies."
