  "overview": "This measure appropriates specific funding amounts for the continued implementation of the Kauhale Initiative and the Ohana Zones Program, while deleting a provision that would have funded broader supportive housing projects. It establishes the Ohana Zones Program as a permanent program within the Statewide Office on Homelessness and Housing Solutions (SOHHS). The bill also imposes new oversight, requiring the State Auditor to conduct a performance audit of the Kauhale Initiative and mandating frequent expenditure reports and a comprehensive needs assessment from SOHHS (HB431_CD1).",
  "appropriations": "The measure inserts specific general fund appropriations for two distinct initiatives. For the continued operation of the Kauhale Initiative, the bill appropriates $18,575,000 (HB431_CD1) for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $24,325,000 (HB431_CD1) for fiscal year 2026-2027. For the implementation of the newly permanent Ohana Zones Program, the bill appropriates $2,525,000 (HB431_CD1) for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $5,855,000 (HB431_CD1) for fiscal year 2026-2027.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal projections are now based on specific appropriation amounts inserted into the bill, rather than on figures from testimony or budget requests. The methodology removes cost considerations for the development of supportive housing and the associated administrative position, as this component has been deleted from the measure. Cost projections now directly reflect the legislatively mandated funding levels for the Kauhale and Ohana Zones programs for the next biennium (HB431_CD1).",
  "agency_impact": "The measure increases the administrative and reporting responsibilities of the Statewide Office on Homelessness and Housing Solutions, which must now submit reports every four months on expenditures and conduct a comprehensive needs assessment (HB431_CD1). The State Auditor is assigned the new task of conducting a management and performance audit of the Kauhale Initiative. This version also clarifies the administrative structure by specifying that the Coordinator on Homelessness reports directly to the Director of Human Services (HB431_CD1).",
  "economic_impact": "",
  "policy_impact": "The measure establishes the Ohana Zones Pilot Program as a permanent program, signaling a long-term state commitment to this homelessness intervention strategy. It significantly narrows the bill's policy scope by deleting appropriations for other supportive housing projects, focusing resources exclusively on the Kauhale and Ohana Zones initiatives. Furthermore, it enhances legislative oversight through new requirements for a performance audit by the State Auditor and detailed reporting from the Statewide Office on Homelessness and Housing Solutions (HB431_CD1).",
  "revenue_sources": "The primary funding source for these initiatives is specified through direct general fund appropriations. The bill allocates a total of $21,100,000 for fiscal year 2025-2026, comprising $18,575,000 (HB431_CD1) for the Kauhale Initiative and $2,525,000 (HB431_CD1) for the Ohana Zones Program. For fiscal year 2026-2027, the total appropriation is $30,180,000, consisting of $24,325,000 (HB431_CD1) for Kauhale and $5,855,000 (HB431_CD1) for Ohana Zones.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The measure establishes a clear fiscal outlook for the next two years with specific general fund appropriations. For fiscal year 2026, the total appropriation is $21,100,000, combining $18,575,000 (HB431_CD1) for the Kauhale Initiative and $2,525,000 (HB431_CD1) for the Ohana Zones Program. For fiscal year 2027, the total appropriation increases to $30,180,000, with $24,325,000 (HB431_CD1) allocated to Kauhale and $5,855,000 (HB431_CD1) to Ohana Zones. The establishment of the Ohana Zones Program as permanent creates an ongoing, recurring cost that will require general fund appropriations in subsequent fiscal years beyond this biennium. Unlike the previous version based on testimony, these amounts are now fixed legislative appropriations. The deletion of the broader supportive housing component removes the previously anticipated recurring cost for a new staff position. New, ongoing costs will be incurred by the State Auditor to conduct the required performance audit and by the Statewide Office on Homelessness and Housing Solutions to fulfill the new reporting requirements.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The establishment of the Ohana Zones Program as a permanent state program ensures there will be ongoing fiscal obligations beyond the six-year outlook. These future costs will require recurring general fund appropriations to sustain operations and services. The appropriations set for fiscal years 2026 and 2027 serve as a new baseline for projecting these long-term costs.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "This version of the bill replaces previously discussed budget requests with specific appropriation amounts for the Kauhale Initiative and Ohana Zones Program, totaling $18,575,000 (HB431_CD1) and $2,525,000 (HB431_CD1) respectively for FY26, and $24,325,000 (HB431_CD1) and $5,855,000 (HB431_CD1) for FY27. A major policy change is the establishment of the Ohana Zones Pilot Program as a permanent program. The measure's scope has been narrowed by deleting language that would have appropriated funds for supportive housing projects and an associated administrative position. Finally, new oversight mechanisms have been added, including a mandatory performance audit of the Kauhale Initiative by the State Auditor and frequent expenditure reporting by the Statewide Office on Homelessness and Housing Solutions (HB431_CD1)."
