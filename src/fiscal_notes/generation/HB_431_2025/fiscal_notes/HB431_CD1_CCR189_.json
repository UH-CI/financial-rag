[16] [16] This measure also specifies that the Coordinator on Homelessness shall report directly to the Director of Human Services. [16]",

  "policy_impact": "This measure establishes the Ohana Zones Program as a permanent program. [16] A significant new policy requires the Auditor to conduct a management and performance audit of the kauhale initiative. [17] Additionally, the Coordinator on Homelessness, formerly the Governor's Coordinator, is now specified to report directly to the Director of Human Services. [17]",
  "revenue_sources": "The appropriations for both the Kauhale Initiative and the Ohana Zones Program are appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii. [16] [16]",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The measure appropriates a total of $42,900,000 from the general fund for the Kauhale Initiative over the next two fiscal years ($18,575,000 (The legislative document specifies $18,575,000.00 (HB431_CD1_.HTM.txt)) in FY 2025-2026 and $24,325,000 (The legislative document specifies $24,325,000.00 (HB431_CD1_.HTM.txt)) in FY 2026-2027).

[16] [16] By establishing the Ohana Zones Program as permanent, the measure anticipates ongoing operational costs beyond this two-year period. [17] There will be administrative costs associated with the new requirement for the Auditor to conduct a management and performance audit of the kauhale initiative. [16] The Statewide Office on Homelessness and Housing Solutions will also incur costs related to new quarterly reporting requirements and the completion of a comprehensive needs assessment. [16] [16] The specification that the Coordinator on Homelessness reports to the Director of Human Services clarifies administrative oversight. [16]",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "In addition to previous requirements, there is now a provision that for any kauhale project estimated to be over $1,000,000 (The legislative document specifies $1,000,000.00 (HB431_CD1_.HTM.txt)), there shall be at least two bidders for the procurement of building services and projects. [16]",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "By establishing the Ohana Zones Program as a permanent program within the Statewide Office on Homelessness and Housing Solutions, the measure creates an ongoing fiscal obligation for the State beyond the initial appropriation period. [17] Continued funding will be necessary to sustain the operations of both the Ohana Zones and Kauhale initiatives. [16] The required annual reports on program performance will likely serve as the basis for future funding requests. [16] [16]",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "This measure now inserts specific appropriation amounts, allocating $18,575,000 (The committee hearing determines $18,575,000.00 (HB431_CD1_CCR189_.htm.txt)) in FY26 and $24,325,000 (The committee hearing determines $24,325,000.00 (HB431_CD1_CCR189_.htm.txt)) for the Kauhale Initiative, and $2,525,000 (The committee hearing determines $2,525,000.00 (HB431_CD1_CCR189_.htm.txt)) in FY26 and $5,855,000 (The committee hearing determines $5,855,000.00 (HB431_CD1_CCR189_.htm.txt)) in FY27 for the Ohana Zones Program.

[17] New oversight mechanisms have been added, including a mandatory management and performance audit of the Kauhale Initiative and quarterly expenditure reports to the Legislature. [17] [17] The measure deletes language that would have funded supportive housing projects and clarifies that the Coordinator on Homelessness reports directly to the Director of Human Services.
