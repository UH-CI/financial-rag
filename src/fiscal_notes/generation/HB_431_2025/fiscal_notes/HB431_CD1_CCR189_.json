  "overview": "This measure now makes the Ohana Zones Program permanent and appropriates specific funding for it and the Kauhale Initiative for fiscal years 2026 and 2027. It removes previously included funding for broader supportive housing projects. The bill also institutes significant new oversight through a mandatory audit of the Kauhale Initiative and frequent legislative reporting requirements.",
  "appropriations": "Specific general fund appropriations have been inserted, allocating $18,575,000 in FY 2025-2026 and $24,325,000 in FY 2026-2027 for the Kauhale Initiative. The Ohana Zones Program is appropriated $2,525,000 in FY 2025-2026 and $5,855,000 in FY 2026-2027. All language that would have appropriated funds for separate supportive housing projects has been deleted.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "Previous assumptions regarding increased capital costs from a utility connection mandate and potential revenue from rent collection are no longer valid, as these provisions have been removed. Fiscal projections are now based on the specific appropriation amounts identified in the bill for program operations. The methodology must now also account for new administrative costs associated with a mandatory audit, a comprehensive needs assessment, and reporting to the legislature every four months.",
  "agency_impact": "The Statewide Office on Homelessness and Housing Solutions will face an increased administrative burden due to new mandates for frequent expenditure reporting, conducting a comprehensive needs assessment, and submitting reports to the Legislature. The agency will also be responsible for managing the Ohana Zones Program as a permanent, ongoing initiative rather than a pilot. The Coordinator on Homelessness is now specified to report directly to the Director of Human Services, clarifying the chain of command.",
  "economic_impact": "The measure's economic impact is now defined by specific appropriations totaling $21,100,000 in FY 2025-2026 and $30,180,000 in FY 2026-2027, directed toward homelessness services. The removal of the rent collection authority means the programs will be fully subsidized by public funds without generating offsetting revenue. Deleting funding for other supportive housing projects narrows the bill's economic focus exclusively to the Kauhale and Ohana Zones initiatives.",
  "policy_impact": "This measure codifies the Ohana Zones Program as a permanent component of the state's homelessness strategy, elevating it from its prior pilot status. It significantly strengthens legislative oversight by requiring a formal audit of the Kauhale Initiative and mandating frequent, detailed expenditure reports. The deletion of prior provisions for rent collection and utility connections signals a policy decision to maintain these initiatives as fully government-funded projects without specific operational mandates attached.",
  "revenue_sources": "The sole source of funding for these initiatives is general fund appropriations. The provision that would have authorized the Kauhale Initiative to generate its own revenue through the collection of rent has been deleted. Consequently, the programs will not produce any offsetting revenue.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The fiscal outlook is now grounded in specific biennial appropriations totaling $51,280,000 for the Kauhale and Ohana Zones programs. Making the Ohana Zones Program permanent establishes an ongoing fiscal obligation that will require recurring general fund appropriations in future budget cycles. Projections of increased capital costs for utility connections and offsetting revenue from rent are no longer relevant as these provisions were removed. Long-term costs will now be shaped by the operational needs of a permanent Ohana Zones program and the continued implementation of Kauhale projects. The newly required management and performance audit represents a one-time cost, while the mandate for frequent reporting and a needs assessment will create recurring administrative expenses for the Statewide Office on Homelessness and Housing Solutions. The findings of the comprehensive needs assessment may influence future funding requests and program scope. The bill's focus is narrowed, as funding for other supportive housing projects was deleted, concentrating the long-term fiscal impact on these two specific initiatives. The administrative structure is also clarified, with the Coordinator on Homelessness reporting to the Director of Human Services, confirming the fiscal oversight responsibilities within that department.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "There is no longer any anticipated impact on operating revenue. The measure has been amended to remove the provision that would have authorized the collection of monthly rents from kauhale residents. The programs are not expected to generate any revenue.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The previously anticipated increase in capital expenditures for connecting kauhale projects to public utilities has been eliminated. This mandate was removed from the final version of the bill. Capital spending will now be dictated by the development plans for Kauhale and Ohana Zone sites funded within the newly specified appropriation amounts.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "By establishing the Ohana Zones Program as permanent, the state incurs a long-term, ongoing fiscal commitment to fund its operations indefinitely, necessitating continuous general fund support in future budgets. The sustainability of both the Kauhale and Ohana Zones initiatives will depend entirely on future legislative appropriations. The measure no longer includes any mechanism for the programs to generate their own revenue to offset costs.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "Specific appropriation amounts have been inserted, totaling $42,900,000 for the Kauhale Initiative and $8,380,000 for the Ohana Zones Program over the FY26-FY27 biennium. The Ohana Zones Pilot Program has been made permanent. Key provisions from the prior version, including the mandate for public utility connections and the authorization to collect rent, have been deleted, removing their associated cost and revenue implications. New legislative oversight has been added through a mandatory audit of the Kauhale Initiative and frequent expenditure reporting requirements."
