  "overview": "This measure establishes requirements for kauhale projects, including reporting requirements by the Statewide Office on Homelessness and Housing Solutions (OHHS). [16] It also establishes the Ohana Zones Program as a permanent program within OHHS and appropriates funds for the continued implementation of both the Kauhale Initiative and the Ohana Zones Program. [17] The measure requires the Auditor to conduct a management and performance audit of the kauhale initiative and changes the reporting structure for the Coordinator on Homelessness. [16] [16]",
  "appropriations": "The measure appropriates out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $18,575,000 (HB431_CD1_.HTM.txt) for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $24,325,000 (HB431_CD1_.HTM.txt) for fiscal year 2026-2027 for the continued operation of the kauhale initiative. [16] [16] For the continued implementation of the ohana zones program, the measure appropriates $2,525,000 (HB431_CD1_.HTM.txt) for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $5,855,000 (HB431_CD1_.HTM.txt) for fiscal year 2026-2027. [16] [16] All sums appropriated shall be expended by the department of human services. [16] [16]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal projections are based on specific appropriation amounts inserted into the bill for the continued operation of two existing programs. [17] [17] The sums are intended to cover expenses including the development and operation of facilities, support services, staffing, and other costs associated with alleviating poverty and transitioning individuals into housing. [16] [16] [16] The fiscal note assumes these amounts are sufficient for the purposes described for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027. [16] [16]",
  "agency_impact": "The sums appropriated for the kauhale initiative and ohana zones program shall be expended by the department of human services. [16] [16] The bill specifies that the Coordinator on Homelessness shall report directly to the Director of Human Services, altering the previous administrative structure. [16] [17] The Statewide Office on Homelessness and Housing Solutions is tasked with new, extensive reporting requirements, including quarterly expenditure reports and a comprehensive needs assessment. [16] [16]",
  "economic_impact": "The measure aims to address the basic needs of individuals experiencing homelessness and transition them into affordable housing. [16] Kauhale projects are authorized to charge monthly rents that do not exceed thirty per cent of the area median income, which will directly affect the finances of residents. [16] The programs provide wrap-around services, social and health care services, and transportation with the goal of alleviating poverty. [16]",
  "policy_impact": "This measure establishes the Ohana Zones Program as a permanent program, shifting it from its previous pilot status. [16] [17] It modifies existing law by changing references from the \"Governor's Coordinator on Homelessness\" to \"Coordinator on Homelessness\" and specifying that the coordinator reports to the Director of Human Services. [16] [17] The bill also imposes new statutory requirements for kauhale projects and mandates a management and performance audit of the kauhale initiative by the State Auditor. [17] [17]",
  "revenue_sources": "The appropriations for the kauhale initiative and ohana zones program are from the general revenues of the State of Hawaii. [16] [16] A potential new revenue stream is created through the provision that the monthly rent charged to any resident of a kauhale shall not exceed thirty per cent of the area median income. [16] No other revenue sources are identified in the measure. [16] [16]",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The measure appropriates a total of $42,900,000 (HB431_CD1_.HTM.txt) for the kauhale initiative and $8,380,000 (HB431_CD1_.HTM.txt) for the ohana zones program over fiscal years 2025-2027. [16] [16] For the kauhale initiative, the bill appropriates $18,575,000 (HB431_CD1_CCR189_.htm.txt) for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $24,325,000 (HB431_CD1_CCR189_.htm.txt) for fiscal year 2026-2027. [17] For the ohana zones program, the appropriation is $2,525,000 (HB431_CD1_CCR189_.htm.txt) for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $5,855,000 (HB431_CD1_CCR189_.htm.txt) for fiscal year 2026-2027. [17] The establishment of the Ohana Zones Program as a permanent program implies an ongoing fiscal commitment beyond the initial two-year appropriation. [17] The description of the kauhale initiative funding as for \"continued operation\" suggests recurring expenses in future years. [16] The mandatory management audit and new reporting requirements will create additional administrative costs for the Auditor's office and the Department of Human Services. [16] [16] Given the permanence of one program and the continuation of the other, similar levels of funding will likely be required in the subsequent four years to maintain program operations and services. [16] [17]",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The measure authorizes a source of operating revenue for kauhale projects. [16] The bill specifies that the monthly rent charged to any resident of a kauhale shall not exceed thirty per cent of the area median income. [16] This provision could provide a recurring revenue stream to help offset the operational costs of the kauhale initiative. [16]",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "Funds are appropriated for the development and operation of kauhale. [16] The bill mandates that any kauhale projects constructed or developed using state funds shall be connected to public utilities, including water, sewer, and electricity, which will involve capital costs. [16] The bill also establishes a requirement of at least two bidders for any kauhale project estimated to be over $1,000,000 (HB431_CD1_.HTM.txt), indicating that significant capital projects are anticipated. [16]",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "By establishing the Ohana Zones Program as a permanent program, the measure creates an ongoing fiscal obligation for the State beyond the six-year horizon. [16] [17] Continued funding will be necessary to sustain the operations, staffing, and support services for both the permanent Ohana Zones Program and the continued Kauhale Initiative. [16] [16] The annual reporting requirements for both programs also imply sustained administrative costs in future years. [16] [16]",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "This version of the bill specifies appropriation amounts, which were previously unspecified; it appropriates $18,575,000 (HB431_CD1_CCR189_.htm.txt) in FY26 and $24,325,000 (HB431_CD1_CCR189_.htm.txt) in FY27 for the Kauhale Initiative, and $2,525,000 (HB431_CD1_CCR189_.htm.txt) in FY26 and $5,855,000 (HB431_CD1_CCR189_.htm.txt) in FY27 for Ohana Zones. [17] [17] The Ohana Zones Pilot Program has been established as a permanent program. [17] New reporting requirements have been added, requiring OHHS to report to the legislature every four months and conduct a comprehensive needs assessment, and requiring the Auditor to conduct a management and performance audit of the Kauhale Initiative. [17] [17] Language that would have appropriated funds for supportive housing projects was deleted. [17] The Coordinator on Homelessness now reports directly to the Director of Human Services instead of the Governor. [17] The effective date was changed from a defective date to July 1, 2025. [17]",
  "fte_positions": "The appropriation for the kauhale initiative includes funding for staffing and related costs to administer the kauhale initiative. [16] The sums appropriated shall be expended by the department of human services. [16] The measure does not specify the number of Full Time Equivalent (FTE) positions to be funded. [16] [16]",
  "appropriations_changes": "Appropriation amounts that were previously unspecified have been inserted into the measure. [17] [17] The bill now appropriates specific sums for the Kauhale Initiative ($18,575,000 (HB431_CD1_CCR189_.htm.txt) for FY 2025-2026 and $24,325,000 (HB431_CD1_CCR189_.htm.txt) for FY 2026-2027) and the Ohana Zones Program ($2,525,000 (HB431_CD1_CCR189_.htm.txt) for FY 2025-2026 and $5,855,000 (HB431_CD1_CCR189_.htm.txt) for FY 2026-2027). [17] [17] Additionally, the committee deleted language that would have appropriated funds for supportive housing projects and supportive services. [17]",
  "funding_sources_changes": "The funding source for all appropriations remains the general revenues of the State of Hawaii. [16] [16] The provision allowing kauhale to charge rent of no more than thirty per cent of the area median income continues to be a potential supplemental revenue source. [16] There have been no changes to the primary method of funding between bill versions. [16] [16]",
  "department_impact": "While the expending agency remains the Department of Human Services as in the prior version, this measure further impacts the department's administrative structure. [16] [16] It specifies that the Coordinator on Homelessness, who heads the Statewide Office on Homelessness and Housing Solutions, shall report directly to the Director of Human Services. [16] [17] This is a change from the previous structure where the coordinator reported to the Governor. [16]",
  "reports_required": "This measure adds several new reporting requirements that were not in the previous version. [17] The coordinator on homelessness must submit annual reports to the legislature on both the kauhale and ohana zones programs. [16] [16] The statewide office on homelessness and housing solutions must submit a report to the legislature every four months detailing expenditures and a separate report on a comprehensive needs assessment by the 2026 regular session. [16] [16] The auditor is required to submit a management and performance audit of the kauhale initiative to the legislature prior to the 2026 regular session. [16]",
  "pilot_program": "A significant change from the previous version is that the Ohana Zones Program is now established as a permanent program. [16] The bill establishes within the office the ohana zones program to provide temporary housing and services to homeless individuals and families. [16] The appropriation is for the continued implementation of the program, which was originally established as a pilot under Act 209, Session Laws of Hawaii 2018. [16]",
  "sunset_date": "The provided documents do not contain a sunset date for the appropriations or the programs. [16] The measure establishes the Ohana Zones Program as a permanent program, implying no sunset. [16]",
  "effective_date": "The effective date has been changed to July 1, 2025. [17] This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2025. [16]"
