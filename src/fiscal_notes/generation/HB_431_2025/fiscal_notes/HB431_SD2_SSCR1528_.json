  "overview": "The purpose and intent of this measure is to appropriate moneys for housing programs. [15] This measure appropriates funds to the Department of Human Services for the continued implementation of the Kauhale Initiative and Ohana Zones Pilot Program and to the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation for the development of supportive housing projects. [14] [14] It requires all kauhale projects to be connected to public utilities and authorizes them to charge monthly rents of no more than thirty per cent of the area median income level. [14] [14]",
  "appropriations": "There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii an unspecified sum for fiscal year 2025-2026 and the same sum for fiscal year 2026-2027 for the continued operation of the kauhale initiative. [14] [14] An unspecified sum from general revenues is also appropriated for the same fiscal years for the continued implementation of the ohana zones pilot program. [14] [14] A third unspecified appropriation from general revenues for the same fiscal years is for the development, operation, and maintenance of affordable, supportive housing projects by the Hawaii housing finance and development corporation. [14] [14] [14]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal note is based on the finding that Hawaii has the highest homelessness rate per capita in the United States. [15] It also assumes that the Kauhale Initiative and Ohana Zones Pilot Program have successfully helped address homelessness in the State and that the appropriations in this measure will continue to support these critical programs. [15] The appropriation to the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation is assumed to enable the development of supportive housing units for households with special needs. [15]",
  "agency_impact": "This measure changes the appropriation expending agency for the Kauhale Initiative and Ohana Zones Pilot Program from the Office of the Governor to the Department of Human Services. [15] The sums appropriated for these two programs shall be expended by the department of human services. [14] [14] The Hawaii housing finance and development corporation remains the expending agency for the appropriation for supportive housing projects. [14]",
  "economic_impact": "The Committee finds that Hawaii has the highest homelessness rate per capita in the United States. [15] The appropriations in this measure will continue to support critical programs that have successfully helped address homelessness in the State. [15] This measure also authorizes the kauhale initiative to charge monthly rents of no more than thirty per cent of the area median income level, which may impact the finances of residents. [14]",
  "policy_impact": "A key policy change in this measure is changing the appropriation expending agency for the Kauhale Initiative and Ohana Zones Pilot Program from the Office of the Governor to the Department of Human Services. [15] The measure also establishes new requirements for kauhale, mandating that they be connected to public utilities. [15] Furthermore, it newly authorizes that monthly rents of no more than thirty per cent of the area median income level be charged for kauhale. [15] [15]",
  "revenue_sources": "The appropriations for the kauhale initiative, ohana zones pilot program, and supportive housing projects are from the general revenues of the State of Hawaii. [14] [14] [14] The measure also creates a potential new revenue stream by providing that the kauhale initiative may charge monthly rents of no more than thirty per cent of the area median income level. [14] No other revenue sources are identified. [14] [14] [14]",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The bill appropriates unspecified sums from the general fund for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027 for the continued operation of the kauhale initiative, the continued implementation of the ohana zones pilot program, and for the development of supportive housing projects. [14] [14] [14] The Kauhale Initiative appropriation is intended for expenses including development, operation, rent supplement payments, support services, staffing, wrap around services, and transportation. [14] [14] This measure changes the expending agency for the Kauhale and Ohana Zones programs to the Department of Human Services, which will have a long-term impact on that department's budget and resource allocation. [15] The Committee recognizes that these programs have successfully helped address homelessness and that the appropriations will continue to support these critical programs, implying a fiscal commitment beyond the initial two-year period. [15] The new requirement for kauhale to be connected to public utilities may have ongoing maintenance costs. [14] The authorization to charge rent may offset a small portion of operating costs in future years. [14]",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "This version of the measure introduces a new potential source of operating revenue for kauhale projects. [14] The bill now specifies that the kauhale initiative may charge monthly rents of no more than thirty per cent of the area median income level. [14] This could provide a revenue stream to offset operational costs, which was not authorized in the previous version. [15]",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The measure appropriates funds for the development and operation of kauhale and for the development, operation, and maintenance of affordable, supportive housing projects. [14] [14] A new provision requires that all kauhale projects shall be connected to public utilities, including water, sewer, and electricity. [14] This requirement will likely result in capital expenditures for new projects to ensure utility connections are established. [14]",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The Committee recognizes that the Kauhale Initiative and Ohana Zones Pilot Program have successfully helped address homelessness in the State. [15] Given that Hawaii has the highest homelessness rate per capita in the United States, there is a continued need for these programs. [15] Sustained funding for operations, services, and development of additional supportive housing will likely be required beyond the six-year horizon to continue addressing homelessness and housing instability. [15]",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "This measure has been amended by changing the appropriation expending agency for the Kauhale Initiative and Ohana Zones Pilot Program from the Office of the Governor to the Department of Human Services. [15] Two new provisions affecting the kauhale initiative have been added: requiring kauhale to be connected to public utilities, and authorizing monthly rents of no more than thirty per cent of the area median income level to be charged for kauhale. [15] [15] Preambles that were in the previous version have also been removed. [15]",
  "fte_positions": "The appropriation for the kauhale initiative includes funding for staffing and related costs to administer the initiative. [14] Following the amendments in this version, the Department of Human Services will be the expending agency responsible for this staffing. [14] The bill does not specify the number of Full Time Equivalent (FTE) positions. [14] [14] [14] [14] [14] [14] [14] [14] [14] [14] [14]",
  "appropriations_changes": "While the appropriation amounts remain unspecified for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027, the expending agency has been changed for two of the three appropriations. [14] [14] [14] The sums appropriated for the continued operation of the kauhale initiative and the continued implementation of the ohana zones pilot program are now to be expended by the department of human services. [14] [14]",
  "funding_sources_changes": "The primary funding source for all appropriations in the bill continues to be the general revenues of the State of Hawaii. [14] [14] [14] This version adds a new provision authorizing the kauhale initiative to charge monthly rents, which could serve as a supplemental program-based revenue source, but does not alter the funding source for the state appropriations. [14]",
  "department_impact": "The measure was amended by changing the appropriation expending agency for the Kauhale Initiative and Ohana Zones Pilot Program from the Office of the Governor to the Department of Human Services. [15] As a result, the sums appropriated for the kauhale initiative and the ohana zones pilot program shall be expended by the department of human services. [14] [14] The Hawaii housing finance and development corporation remains the expending agency for funds related to the development of supportive housing projects. [14]",
  "reports_required": "The provided documents do not contain information regarding any reports required to be submitted to the legislature. [14] [14] [14] [14] [14] [14] [14] [14] [14] [14] [14] [14] [14] [14] [15] [15] [15] [15] [15] [15] [15] [15] [15] [15] [15] [15] [15]",
  "pilot_program": "This measure appropriates funds for the continued implementation of the ohana zones pilot program established under Act 209, Session Laws of Hawaii 2018. [14] Your Committee recognizes that the Ohana Zones Pilot Program has successfully helped address homelessness in the State. [15] The program remains a pilot program under this measure. [14]",
