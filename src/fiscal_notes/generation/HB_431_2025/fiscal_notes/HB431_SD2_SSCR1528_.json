  "overview": "The expending agency for the Kauhale and Ohana Zones programs has been changed from the Office of the Governor to the Department of Human Services (HB431_SD2). The measure now imposes new requirements on kauhale projects, mandating they be connected to public utilities and authorizing them to charge rent up to 30% of the area median income (HB431_SD2_SSCR1528_). Testimony introduced specific funding targets, including a request for $50,000,000 (HB431_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-28-25_) per year from the Governor's budget for the Kauhale Initiative.",
  "appropriations": "The expending agency for the Kauhale Initiative and Ohana Zones Pilot Program appropriations has been changed to the Department of Human Services (HB431_SD2). Testimony from the Office of the Governor indicated that the Executive Biennium Budget requested $50,000,000 (HB431_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-28-25_) each for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027 for the Kauhale initiative. Additionally, Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation testimony requests $175,000 (HB431_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-28-25_) for one full-time equivalent position to administer its supportive housing responsibilities.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal analysis now incorporates a potential revenue stream, as the measure authorizes kauhale projects to charge rent up to thirty percent of the area median income, which will affect net operating cost calculations (HB431_SD2). Cost assumptions must also be updated to include expenditures for connecting kauhale to public water, sewer, and electricity utilities (HB431_SD2). The Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation's cost estimate includes $175,000 (HB431_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-28-25_) for one housing finance specialist position, reflecting a specific administrative need.",
  "agency_impact": "The Department of Human Services is now designated as the expending agency for the Kauhale and Ohana Zones appropriations, transferring fiscal and administrative oversight for these programs from the Office of the Governor (HB431_SD2). The Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation testimony requests $175,000 (HB431_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-28-25_) for one new full-time equivalent position to manage the development and operation of supportive housing projects. This indicates an increased administrative workload for the corporation.",
  "economic_impact": "The measure now authorizes a rent structure for kauhale residents capped at thirty percent of the area median income, which may provide a sustainable revenue source to support ongoing operations and services (HB431_SD2). This change could improve the long-term financial viability of the projects, reducing their reliance on future general fund appropriations. The new requirement for public utility connections ensures a higher standard of housing for residents, though it may increase upfront development costs (HB431_SD2_SSCR1528_).",
  "policy_impact": "This version of the bill shifts administrative authority for the Kauhale Initiative and Ohana Zones Pilot Program from the Office of the Governor to the Department of Human Services (HB431_SD2_SSCR1528_). It also establishes new statutory requirements for kauhale projects, mandating that they be connected to public utilities and setting a rent cap at thirty percent of the area median income (HB431_SD2). These changes create a more defined regulatory framework for the development and operation of kauhale communities.",
  "revenue_sources": "The measure introduces a new potential revenue source by authorizing kauhale projects to collect monthly rents from residents, capped at no more than thirty percent of the area median income (HB431_SD2). This rental income can be used to offset operational costs, supplementing the primary funding from general fund appropriations. The exact amount of revenue generated will depend on the number of units, occupancy, and specific rent levels set.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "Testimony from the Governor's Office indicates the executive budget requested $50,000,000 (HB431_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-28-25_) in general funds for fiscal year 2026 and an additional $50,000,000 (HB431_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-28-25_) for fiscal year 2027 for the Kauhale Initiative. In addition to these large programmatic costs, the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation testimony requests an ongoing personnel cost of $175,000 (HB431_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-28-25_) for one full-time employee beginning in fiscal year 2026 to administer the supportive housing component. While the bill's appropriations are currently blank, these figures from testimony indicate the potential scale of recurring funding requests over the next biennium. The newly authorized ability to charge rent may generate some offsetting revenue, but the program is expected to require significant, recurring general fund appropriations. The mandate for public utility connections will likely increase capital costs for any new projects built within the six-year period. Ongoing costs will include staffing, maintenance, project-based rent supplements, and wrap-around supportive services for residents across multiple sites.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "A new provision authorizes the kauhale initiative to generate operating revenue by charging monthly rent, with the amount not to exceed thirty percent of the area median income (HB431_SD2). This creates a new revenue stream that was not present in the previous version of the bill. The total potential revenue is dependent on the number of occupied units and the rental rates established.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The measure now mandates that all kauhale projects must be connected to public utilities, including water, sewer, and electricity (HB431_SD2). This requirement will introduce new capital costs for site development and infrastructure, which were not previously mandated. These expenditures will vary depending on the location and existing infrastructure of each project site.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The programmatic funding requests, such as the Governor's budget request for $50,000,000 (HB431_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-28-25_) per year, and the creation of a permanent HHFDC position with a salary of $175,000 (HB431_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-28-25_), suggest an intent for long-term program operation. Fiscal obligations beyond the six-year outlook will likely consist of recurring general fund appropriations for operations, maintenance, and supportive services. These ongoing costs will be partially offset by rental revenue generated from kauhale residents.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The expending agency for the Kauhale Initiative and Ohana Zones Program was changed from the Office of the Governor to the Department of Human Services (HB431_SD2). New requirements were established for kauhale projects, mandating connection to public utilities and authorizing the collection of rent up to thirty percent of the area median income (HB431_SD2_SSCR1528_). Testimony provided specific funding figures not previously available, including the Governor's budget request for $50,000,000 (HB431_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-28-25_) annually for the Kauhale Initiative and HHFDC's request for $175,000 (HB431_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-28-25_) for a new staff position."
