This measure represents a critical step forward in meeting the housing needs of Hawaii's most vulnerable populations by providing additional funds for these initiatives (HB431_HD1). It also aims to support partnerships between government and the community to create an effective, efficient, and transparent system for developers, service providers, and individuals with special housing needs (HB431_HD1).\",\n  \"appropriations\": \"While the measure was amended to change appropriations to unspecified amounts, the Committee on Human Services & Homelessness respectfully requests the Committee on Finance to consider an appropriation of $50,000,000 (HB431_HD1) for the continued operation of the Kauhale Initiative. It also requests consideration of $12,000,000 (HB431_HD1) to be deposited into the Supportive Housing Special Fund (HB431_HD1). Of this amount, $11,810,250 (HB431_HD1) is for financing the development, operation, and maintenance of supportive housing projects and services, and $189,750 (HB431_HD1) is for one temporary full-time equivalent (1.0 FTE) Housing Finance Specialist I position (HB431_HD1).\",\n  \"assumptions_and_methodology\": \"The fiscal projections are based on amounts requested for consideration by the House Committee on Finance as detailed in the standing committee report for H.B.

The cost for the new position is specified as $189,750 (HB431_HD1), but the documents do not provide a detailed breakdown or methodology for how these overall funding levels were determined.\",\n  \"agency_impact\": \"The Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation (HHFDC) supports the establishment of one full-time equivalent (1.0 FTE) housing finance specialist I position to help with the administration of the supportive housing special fund (HB431_HD1_TESTIMONY_HSG_02-12-25_). The State Procurement Office recommends that procurement exemption language be removed, stating that exemptions mean procurements made with taxpayer monies will not have the same oversight, accountability and transparency requirements (HB431_HD1_TESTIMONY_HSG_02-12-25_). The Department of Budget and Finance does not support the creation of any special fund which does not meet the requirements of Section 37-52.3, HRS, and notes it is difficult to determine whether the proposed fund would be self-sustaining (HB431_HD1_TESTIMONY_HSG_02-12-25_).\",\n  \"economic_impact\": \"Testimony from the Office of Hawaiian Affairs indicates that supportive housing has significant economic benefits, citing a finding that people offered supportive housing spent 23% fewer days in hospitals and had 33% fewer emergency room visits (HB431_HD1_TESTIMONY_HSG_02-12-25_). The same testimony notes that supportive housing reduces recidivism, referencing a study showing the rate for individuals with housing support was 12.8% versus 50% without (HB431_HD1_TESTIMONY_HSG_02-12-25_).

A key amendment in this version of the bill was deleting language that would have established a separate Kauhale Initiative Special Fund (HB431_HD1). The committee also inserted language that appropriates an unspecified amount to assist the Statewide Office on Homelessness and Housing Solutions in implementing the Kauhale Initiative (HB431_HD1).\",\n  \"revenue_sources\": \"The measure appropriates an unspecified amount of general funds in both FY 26 and FY 27 to the Office of the Governor for the Kauhale Initiative (HB431_HD1_TESTIMONY_HSG_02-12-25_).

In 2023, the legislature also appropriated $25,000,000 (HB431_HD1_.HTM.txt) to fund the kauhale initiative (HB431_HD1_.HTM.txt).

A recurring administrative cost will be the temporary Housing Finance Specialist I position at a cost of $189,750 (HB431_HD1).

The Department of Budget and Finance testimony notes that it is \\\"difficult to determine whether the proposed SHSF would be self-sustaining\\\" (HB431_HD1_TESTIMONY_HSG_02-12-25_), indicating an expected reliance on general fund appropriations rather than self-generated revenue.
