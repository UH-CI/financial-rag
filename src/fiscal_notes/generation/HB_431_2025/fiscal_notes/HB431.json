  "overview": "The purpose of this Act is to appropriate funds for the continued implementation of the kauhale initiative, create the supportive housing special fund, and create a kauhale initiative special fund. [1] [1] This measure will assist the Hawaii housing finance and development corporation to facilitate the development of mixed-income rental housing projects for special needs individuals or families. [1] It also establishes one temporary full-time equivalent (1.0 FTE) housing finance specialist I position within the Hawaii housing finance and development corporation to help with administration of the special fund. [1]",
  "appropriations": "There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $50,000,000 (HB431_.HTM.txt) for fiscal year 2025-2026 and the same sum for fiscal year 2026-2027 for the continued operation of the kauhale initiative. [1] The measure also appropriates $12,000,000 (HB431_.HTM.txt) from general revenues for fiscal year 2025-2026 and the same sum for fiscal year 2026-2027 to be deposited into the supportive housing special fund. [1] [1] Out of the supportive housing special fund, the bill appropriates $12,000,000 (HB431_.HTM.txt) for each of fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027, which includes $189,750 (HB431_.HTM.txt) for one temporary full-time equivalent housing finance specialist I position. [1] [1]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal projections are based on specific appropriations outlined in the bill for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027. [1] [1] These appropriations appear to be based on the continuation and expansion of previous legislative efforts, such as the ohana zones pilot program which initially appropriated $30,000,000 (HB431_.HTM.txt) and a supportive housing pilot program funded with $5,000,000 (HB431_.HTM.txt). [1] [1] The cost for staffing is explicitly stated, with $189,750 (HB431_.HTM.txt) appropriated for the establishment and hiring of one temporary full-time equivalent (1.0 FTE) housing finance specialist I. [1]",
  "agency_impact": "The Hawaii housing finance and development corporation is tasked with administering the new supportive housing special fund. [1] The corporation will also establish one temporary full-time equivalent (1.0 FTE) housing finance specialist I position to help with the administration of the fund. [1] [1] The statewide office on homelessness and housing solutions is responsible for administering the new kauhale initiative special fund. [1]",
  "economic_impact": "The bill's purpose is to address homelessness by creating deeply affordable spaces for housing and healing the houseless. [1] By funding the kauhale initiative, the measure provides temporary and long-term solutions such as emergency shelter, medical respite, supportive housing, and affordable housing for homeless individuals and families. [1] The supportive housing special fund aims to help special needs populations live more stable and productive lives by combining affordable housing with access to services. [1] [1]",
  "policy_impact": "This Act amends Chapter 201H, Hawaii Revised Statutes, by adding a new subpart to establish a supportive housing special fund. [1] It also amends Chapter 346, Hawaii Revised Statutes, by adding two new sections to establish a kauhale initiative special fund. [1] These changes create a new financing tool specifically for supportive housing and provide a dedicated fund to assist in implementing the kauhale initiative. [1] [1]",
  "revenue_sources": "The bill appropriates funds out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii. [1] [1] The supportive housing special fund may also include sums from private contributions, proceeds from repayment of loans, interest, fees, other returns, and moneys from other sources. [1] [1] The kauhale initiative special fund may also include sums from program revenues, private contributions, interest, and moneys from other sources. [1]",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "For fiscal year 2025-2026, the bill appropriates a total of $62,000,000 from general revenues, comprising $50,000,000 (HB431_.HTM.txt) for the kauhale initiative and $12,000,000 (HB431_.HTM.txt) for the supportive housing special fund. [1] [1] An identical appropriation is made for fiscal year 2026-2027. [1] [1] From the supportive housing special fund, $12,000,000 (HB431_.HTM.txt) is appropriated for expenditure in each of fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027. [1] A portion of this, $189,750 (HB431_.HTM.txt) annually, is for one temporary 1.0 FTE housing finance specialist I. [1] The remaining funds from the supportive housing special fund are for financing the development, operation, and maintenance of affordable, supportive housing projects and providing supportive services. [1] The sums appropriated for the kauhale initiative are specified not to lapse at the end of the fiscal biennium. [1] The bill does not contain fiscal projections or appropriations beyond fiscal year 2026-2027. [1] Continued operation of these initiatives would require further appropriations in subsequent years. [1] The creation of special funds suggests a long-term commitment to these programs. [1] [1]",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The Hawaii housing finance and development corporation is authorized to establish, revise, charge, and collect a reasonable service fee in connection with its financing and services related to the supportive housing special fund. [1] These fees shall be deposited into the supportive housing special fund, creating a potential new revenue stream for the fund. [1] The kauhale initiative special fund may also include program revenues. [1]",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "Moneys from the supportive housing special fund may be used to make loans to finance the development, pre-development, construction, acquisition, preservation, or substantial rehabilitation of supportive housing projects. [1] Funds for the kauhale initiative are designated for expenses related to the development and operation of kauhale. [1] This builds upon past programs that funded the construction of modular temporary units and renovation of existing structures. [1]",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "While appropriations are only specified for a two-year period, the establishment of the supportive housing special fund and the kauhale initiative special fund implies an ongoing fiscal commitment. [1] [1] Continuing the programs at the levels funded in this bill would require significant annual appropriations beyond the initial biennium. [1] [1] The long-term sustainability of these efforts will depend on future legislative appropriations and any revenues generated by the special funds through fees, loan repayments, or contributions. [1] [1]",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "A previous fiscal note was not provided, so a comparison cannot be made. [1]"
