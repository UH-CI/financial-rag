  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The provided document does not specify the assumptions, cost estimation methods, or data sources used to determine the appropriation amounts. The funding is allocated for the continued operation and implementation of existing programs. No information regarding comparable programs or historical budgets was included in the text.",
  "agency_impact": "The Statewide Office on Homelessness and Housing Solutions is tasked with managing the appropriated funds and implementing the Kauhale and Ohana Zones programs. The agency is also required to submit a comprehensive needs assessment and provide reports to the Legislature every four months detailing fund expenditures. Additionally, the Coordinator on Homelessness will now report directly to the Director of Human Services, and the Auditor is required to conduct an audit of the Kauhale Initiative.",
  "economic_impact": "The provided document does not detail specific economic effects such as cost savings or direct community benefits. The appropriations are intended for the continuation of programs aimed at addressing homelessness through the Kauhale Initiative and Ohana Zones. The expected impact is the continued provision of housing and supportive services to individuals experiencing homelessness.",
  "policy_impact": "This measure amends state policy by establishing the Ohana Zones Pilot Program as a permanent state program, ensuring its continuation beyond a trial basis. It modifies governance by changing the reporting structure of the Coordinator on Homelessness to fall under the Director of Human Services. The bill also increases oversight by mandating a performance audit of the Kauhale Initiative and regular legislative reporting on program expenditures.",
  "revenue_sources": "The provided legislative document appropriates funds for the Kauhale Initiative and Ohana Zones Program but does not specify the revenue source. It is not stated whether the funding will be derived from general funds, special funds, grants, or other revenue streams. The document focuses solely on the allocation of funds rather than their origin.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The measure provides a two-year fiscal outlook rather than a full six-year projection. For fiscal year 2025-2026, the total appropriation is $21,100,000 (HB431), which includes $18,575,000 (HB431) for the Kauhale Initiative and $2,525,000 (HB431) for the Ohana Zones Program. In fiscal year 2026-2027, the total appropriation increases to $30,180,000 (HB431), comprising $24,325,000 (HB431) for the Kauhale Initiative and $5,855,000 (HB431) for the Ohana Zones Program. The legislation makes the Ohana Zones Program permanent, implying recurring expenses beyond this two-year period. However, the document does not provide cost projections or staffing assumptions for the subsequent four years.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The provided document does not describe any anticipated impacts on the State's operating revenues. The measure is focused on appropriating funds for expenditures related to homelessness programs. There is no mention of any new fees, charges, or other revenue-generating mechanisms resulting from this bill.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The document does not explicitly identify any capital expenditures. Funds are appropriated for the 'continued implementation' and 'continued operation' of the Kauhale Initiative and Ohana Zones Program. It is not specified if these funds will be used for capital costs such as new construction, facilities acquisition, or major equipment purchases.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "By establishing the Ohana Zones Program as a permanent program, the measure creates an ongoing fiscal obligation for the state beyond the initial two-year appropriation period. However, the document does not project annual operating costs or the sustainability of funding after the initial six years. Continued funding would be necessary to maintain the program's operations indefinitely.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "A previous fiscal note was not provided in the context, so a comparison cannot be made. This fiscal note is based solely on the information contained within the conference committee report for H.B. No. 431, H.D. 2, S.D. 2, C.D. 1."
