  "overview": "This measure appropriates funds for the continued operation of the Kauhale Initiative and establishes a supportive housing special fund to be administered by the Hawaii housing finance and development corporation. [3] The bill aims to facilitate the development of mixed-income rental housing projects for individuals and families with special needs. [3] Language that would have established a separate Kauhale Initiative Special Fund was deleted by the committee. [4]",
  "appropriations": "The bill was amended to make all appropriations unspecified amounts. [4] However, the Committee on Human Services & Homelessness requested that the Committee on Finance consider an appropriation of $50,000,000 (HB431_HD1_HSCR3_.htm.txt) for the continued operation of the Kauhale Initiative. [CHUNK_62, NUMBER_5] The committee also requested consideration of $12,000,000 (HB431_HD1_HSCR3_.htm.txt) to be deposited into the Supportive Housing Special Fund, with $11,810,250 (HB431_HD1_HSCR3_.htm.txt) for projects and $189,750 (HB431_HD1_HSCR3_.htm.txt) for one temporary FTE position. [CHUNK_62, CHUNK_63, NUMBER_6, NUMBER_7, NUMBER_8]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The provided documents do not specify the methodology used to derive the suggested appropriation amounts. [4] The fiscal plan is based on the finding that Hawaii has the highest homelessness rate per capita in the nation and that continued efforts are needed. [4] The appropriations are intended to fund the Kauhale Initiative and create a new financing tool for supportive housing to address this issue. [3] [3]",
  "agency_impact": "The Hawaii housing finance and development corporation will be responsible for administering the new supportive housing special fund. [3] This includes establishing one temporary full-time equivalent (1.0 FTE) housing finance specialist I position to help with its administration. [3] [3] The office of the governor is designated to expend the appropriations for the kauhale initiative and may transfer funds to other agencies like the statewide office on homelessness and housing solutions. [3] [3]",
  "economic_impact": "This measure represents a critical step forward in meeting the housing needs of Hawaii's most vulnerable populations. [4] It enables the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation to work with developers to create additional supportive housing units. [4] The measure also supports efforts to build partnerships between government and the community to create an effective and efficient system for developers and service providers. [4]",
  "policy_impact": "This Act amends Chapter 201H, Hawaii Revised Statutes, by adding a new subpart to establish the supportive housing special fund. [3] It also establishes one temporary full-time equivalent (1.0 FTE) housing finance specialist I position within the Hawaii housing finance and development corporation. [3] Language that would have established the Kauhale Initiative Special Fund was deleted in the amended version of the bill. [4]",
  "revenue_sources": "Appropriations for the kauhale initiative and the deposit into the new special fund are from the general revenues of the State of Hawaii. [3] [3] The supportive housing special fund may also include private contributions, proceeds from repayment of loans, interest, fees, other returns, and moneys from other sources. [3] A proposed Kauhale Initiative Special Fund, which would have been another revenue vehicle, was deleted from the measure. [4]",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The bill as amended contains unspecified appropriations for fiscal year 2025-2026 and fiscal year 2026-2027. [3] [3] [4] The Committee on Human Services & Homelessness requested that the Committee on Finance consider an appropriation of $50,000,000 (HB431_HD1_HSCR3_.htm.txt) for the continued operation of the Kauhale Initiative for each of the two fiscal years. [CHUNK_62, NUMBER_5] The committee also requested consideration of a deposit of $12,000,000 (HB431_HD1_HSCR3_.htm.txt) into the Supportive Housing Special Fund for each of the two fiscal years. [CHUNK_62, NUMBER_6] Out of the special fund, the committee recommended expending $11,810,250 (HB431_HD1_HSCR3_.htm.txt) for the financing of supportive housing projects and $189,750 (HB431_HD1_HSCR3_.htm.txt) for one temporary 1.0 FTE position. [CHUNK_63, CHUNK_64, NUMBER_7, NUMBER_8] A significant change from any prior version is the deletion of language that attempted to prevent the proper lapse of the general fund appropriation at the end of the fiscal biennium. [4] No fiscal information beyond the two-year period is provided. [3] [3]",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The Hawaii housing finance and development corporation is authorized to establish, revise, charge, and collect a reasonable service fee in connection with its financing and services under the supportive housing program. [3] These fees are to be deposited into the supportive housing special fund. [3] A provision for a Kauhale Initiative Special Fund, which may have included program revenues, was deleted from the bill. [4]",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "Moneys in the supportive housing special fund may be used to make loans to finance the development, pre-development, construction, acquisition, preservation, or substantial rehabilitation of supportive housing projects. [3] The fund can also be used for project-based rental assistance payments and payments for supportive services. [3] No specific capital projects are identified for the current appropriation request. [3]",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The establishment of the permanent supportive housing special fund indicates an ongoing fiscal commitment beyond the initial biennium. [3] This fund is designed to receive future sums appropriated by the legislature, private contributions, and other moneys to continue its purpose. [3] The continued implementation of the kauhale initiative will likely require future general fund appropriations in subsequent biennia. [3] [3]",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "Compared to the previous fiscal note, several key changes were made to the bill. [4] First, the bill was amended by changing all appropriations to unspecified amounts. [4] Second, language that would have established the Kauhale Initiative Special Fund was deleted. [4] Third, language preventing the general fund appropriation from lapsing at the end of the fiscal biennium was also deleted. [4] Finally, the effective dates were changed to June 29, 3000, and July 1, 3000, to encourage further discussion. [4]",
  "fte_positions": "The bill establishes one temporary full-time equivalent (1.0 FTE) housing finance specialist I within the Hawaii housing finance and development corporation. [3] This position is intended to help with the administration of the supportive housing special fund. [3] [3] The Committee on Human Services & Homelessness requested that the Committee on Finance consider an appropriation amount of $189,750 (HB431_HD1_HSCR3_.htm.txt) for the position. [CHUNK_63, CHUNK_64, NUMBER_8]",
  "appropriations_changes": "The primary change is that the committee has amended this measure by changing the appropriations to unspecified amounts. [4] This differs from any prior version of the bill that may have contained specific dollar figures. [4] The Committee on Human Services & Homelessness has requested that the Committee on Finance consider specific figures, including $50,000,000 (HB431_HD1_HSCR3_.htm.txt) for the Kauhale Initiative and $12,000,000 (HB431_HD1_HSCR3_.htm.txt) for the Supportive Housing Special Fund. [CHUNK_62, NUMBER_5, NUMBER_6]",
  "funding_sources_changes": "The method of funding for the primary appropriations remains the general revenues of the State of Hawaii. [3] [3] A major change in the bill's funding structure is the deletion of language that would have established the Kauhale Initiative Special Fund. [4] This removes a dedicated special fund that would have served as a separate funding vehicle for that initiative. [4]",
  "department_impact": "The department responsibilities remain largely the same, with the office of the governor expending funds for the Kauhale Initiative and the Hawaii Housing finance and development corporation expending funds from the Supportive Housing Special Fund. [3] [3] However, the deletion of the Kauhale Initiative Special Fund removes the direct responsibility of administering that specific fund from the Statewide Office on Homelessness and Housing. [4]",
  "reports_required": "The Hawaii housing finance and development corporation is required to submit a report to the legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of each regular session. [3] The report must describe the projects funded using moneys from the supportive housing special fund. [3] A reporting requirement tied to the Kauhale Initiative Special Fund is no longer applicable as the fund's establishment was deleted from the measure. [4]",
  "pilot_program": "This bill does not establish a new pilot program. [3] Instead, it provides continued funding for the kauhale initiative, which is an evolution of previous pilot programs like the ohana zones pilot program established in 2018. [3] [3] The bill makes the financing mechanism for supportive housing permanent by establishing the supportive housing special fund. [3]",
  "sunset_date": "The bill does not contain a sunset date for the programs or the special fund established. [3]",
  "effective_date": "This Act shall take effect on June 29, 3000. [3] The committee report notes this date was chosen to encourage further discussion. [4] Sections 2, 5, and 6, which relate to appropriations, shall take effect on July 1, 3000. [3]"
