  "overview": "The purpose of this measure is to appropriate funds for the continued operation of the Kauhale Initiative and to establish and appropriate funds into and out of the Supportive Housing Special Fund. [4] [4] This measure represents a critical step forward in meeting the housing needs of Hawaii's most vulnerable populations. [4] The measure has been amended to delete the establishment of the Kauhale Initiative Special Fund and change the effective dates to encourage further discussion. [4] [4]",
  "appropriations": "The appropriations in the bill have been changed to unspecified amounts. [4] Your Committee respectfully requests your Committee on Finance, should it deliberate on this measure, to consider an appropriation amount of $50,000,000 (HB431_HD1_HSCR3_.htm.txt) for the continued operation of the Kauhale Initiative. [CHUNK_262, NUMBER_24] The committee also requests consideration of $12,000,000 (HB431_HD1_HSCR3_.htm.txt) to be deposited into and out of the Supportive Housing Special Fund, which includes $11,810,250 (HB431_HD1_HSCR3_.htm.txt) for projects and supportive services and $189,750 (HB431_HD1_HSCR3_.htm.txt) for one temporary full-time equivalent (1.0 FTE) Housing Finance Specialist I. [CHUNK_262, NUMBER_25] [CHUNK_263, NUMBER_26] [CHUNK_263, NUMBER_27]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The measure was amended by changing the appropriations to unspecified amounts. [4] The fiscal projections are now based on amounts the Committee on Human Services & Homelessness has requested the Committee on Finance to consider. [4] These requested amounts are based on previous legislative efforts, such as the ohana zones pilot program which initially appropriated $30,000,000 (HB431_HD1_.HTM.txt), and prior funding for the kauhale initiative which was set at $25,000,000 (HB431_HD1_.HTM.txt). [CHUNK_203, NUMBER_28] [CHUNK_208, NUMBER_32]",
  "agency_impact": "This measure appropriates an unspecified amount to assist the Statewide Office on Homelessness and Housing Solutions in implementing the Kauhale Initiative, as the language that would have established the Kauhale Initiative Special Fund was deleted. [4] [4] The Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation is tasked with administering the Supportive Housing Special Fund and establishing one temporary full-time equivalent (1.0 FTE) Housing Finance Specialist I position. [4] The Department of Budget and Finance offered comments that it does not support the creation of any special fund which does not meet the requirements of Section 37-52.3, HRS, and questioned if the proposed funds would be self-sustaining. [2] [2]",
  "economic_impact": "Testimony indicates that housing through Kauhale costs around $30,000 (HB431_TESTIMONY_HSH_01-28-25_.PDF.txt) per person per year, while incarceration costs $112,000 (HB431_TESTIMONY_HSH_01-28-25_.PDF.txt) for each resident per year. [CHUNK_114, NUMBER_8] [CHUNK_114, NUMBER_9] A study by Partners in Care revealed that the recidivism rate for individuals who received housing support was just 12.8% versus 50% without housing support. [2] Additionally, the Return to Home program has potentially saved Hawaii taxpayers $11.2 million (HB431_TESTIMONY_HSH_01-28-25_.PDF.txt), based on an average cost of $82,000 (HB431_TESTIMONY_HSH_01-28-25_.PDF.txt) per person per year not in stable housing. [CHUNK_56, NUMBER_4] [CHUNK_56, NUMBER_5]",
  "policy_impact": "This measure was amended to delete language that would have established the Kauhale Initiative Special Fund. [4] Language that attempted to prevent the proper lapse of a general fund appropriation at the end of the fiscal biennium was also deleted. [4] The bill continues to establish a Supportive Housing Special Fund by amending Chapter 201H, Hawaii Revised Statutes, to facilitate the development of supportive housing units for special needs populations. [3] [3]",
  "revenue_sources": "The measure appropriates funds out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii. [3] [3] The Supportive Housing Special Fund may also include sums from private contributions, proceeds from repayment of loans, interest, fees, other returns, and moneys from other sources. [3] The previously proposed Kauhale Initiative Special Fund and its associated revenue mechanisms have been removed from the measure. [4]",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The Committee on Finance is requested to consider appropriations for the biennium beginning in fiscal year 2025-2026. [4] The request includes $50,000,000 (HB431_HD1_HSCR3_.htm.txt) per year for the Kauhale Initiative and $12,000,000 (HB431_HD1_HSCR3_.htm.txt) per year for the Supportive Housing Special Fund. [CHUNK_262, NUMBER_24] [CHUNK_262, NUMBER_25] While the bill text has unspecified appropriation amounts, the committee's request details the intended funding levels. [4] [4] Of the special fund amount, $11,810,250 (HB431_HD1_HSCR3_.htm.txt) is for housing projects and services, and $189,750 (HB431_HD1_HSCR3_.htm.txt) is for one temporary 1.0 FTE staff position. [CHUNK_263, NUMBER_26] [CHUNK_263, NUMBER_27] The provision that would have prevented the general fund appropriation from lapsing has been deleted. [4] The Department of Budget and Finance noted that any general funds appropriated should lapse no later than June 30, 2028. [2] The effective dates of the bill have been changed to June 29, 3000, and July 1, 3000, to encourage further discussion. [4] No appropriations are provided beyond fiscal year 2026-2027. [3] [3] [3] Continued funding for these initiatives would require future legislative appropriations. [4]",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The Hawaii housing finance and development corporation may establish, revise, charge, and collect a reasonable service fee in connection with its financing, services, and approvals related to the Supportive Housing Special Fund. [3] These fees are to be deposited into the supportive housing special fund, creating a potential revenue source. [3] The provision for the Kauhale Initiative Special Fund, which could have included program revenues, has been deleted from the bill. [4]",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "Funds from the Supportive Housing Special Fund may be used to make loans to finance the development, pre-development, construction, acquisition, preservation, or substantial rehabilitation of supportive housing projects. [3] Appropriations for the Kauhale Initiative will cover expenses related to the development and operation of kauhale. [3] This continues prior efforts, such as the ohana zones pilot program which initially received $30,000,000 (HB431_HD1_.HTM.txt). [CHUNK_203, NUMBER_28]",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The creation of the Supportive Housing Special Fund implies an ongoing commitment to addressing housing needs for vulnerable populations beyond the initial biennium. [3] The long-term sustainability of this fund will depend on future legislative appropriations and any revenues generated through fees, loan repayments, or contributions. [3] The Kauhale Initiative will be reliant on recurring general fund appropriations for continued operations after the current biennium, as its dedicated special fund was removed from the bill. [4]",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "This measure was amended to delete language that would have established the Kauhale Initiative Special Fund; the previous version of the bill included two new special funds. [4] The specific appropriation amounts in the bill have been changed to unspecified amounts, though the committee report requests the Committee on Finance consider an appropriation of $50,000,000 (HB431_HD1_HSCR3_.htm.txt) for the Kauhale Initiative and $12,000,000 (HB431_HD1_HSCR3_.htm.txt) for the Supportive Housing Special Fund.
