  "overview": "The purpose of this measure is to appropriate funds for the continued operation of the Kauhale Initiative and to establish and appropriate funds into and out of the Supportive Housing Special Fund to assist the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation. [3] [3] This measure represents a critical step forward in meeting the housing needs of Hawaii's most vulnerable populations by providing additional funds for the Kauhale Initiative and enabling the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation to work with developers to create additional supportive housing units. [3] The amended measure also inserts language that appropriates an unspecified amount to assist the Statewide Office on Homelessness and Housing Solutions in implementing the Kauhale Initiative. [3]",
  "appropriations": "Your Committee has amended this measure by changing the appropriations to unspecified amounts. [3] The Committee on Finance is respectfully requested to consider an appropriation amount of $50,000,000 (HB431_HD1_HSCR3_.htm.txt) for the continued operation of the Kauhale Initiative and $12,000,000 (HB431_HD1_HSCR3_.htm.txt) to be deposited into and out of the Supportive Housing Special Fund. [3] This includes a requested $11,810,250 (HB431_HD1_HSCR3_.htm.txt) for the financing of the development, operation, and maintenance of affordable, supportive housing projects and $189,750 (HB431_HD1_HSCR3_.htm.txt) for the establishment and hiring of one temporary full-time equivalent Housing Finance Specialist I. [3] [3]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The measure is supported by assumptions of cost-effectiveness, with testimony indicating Kauhale costs are around $30,000 (HB431_TESTIMONY_HSH_01-28-25_.PDF.txt) per person per year, compared to incarceration costs of $112,000 (HB431_TESTIMONY_HSH_01-28-25_.PDF.txt) for each resident per year. [2] Another estimate suggests the cost to care for a homeless person not in stable housing is an average of $82,000 (HB431_TESTIMONY_HSH_01-28-25_.PDF.txt) per person per year. [2] Furthermore, a study by Partners in Care is cited, which revealed that the recidivism rate for individuals who received housing support was just 12.8% versus 50% without housing support. [2]",
  "agency_impact": "The Supportive Housing Special Fund will be administered by the Hawai‘i Housing and Finance and Development Corporation (HHFDC). [2] The Committee on Finance is requested to consider funding for one temporary full-time equivalent (1.0 FTE) Housing Finance Specialist I within the HHFDC to help with administration of the special fund. [3] The Statewide Office on Homelessness and Housing Solutions (SOHHS) requested one full-time equivalent (1.0 FTE) Return to Home Homelessness Assistant position to help with the administration of the Return to Home Program statewide. [2]",
  "economic_impact": "This bill is expected to dramatically reduce the jail population and recidivism at a significantly lower cost than incarceration. [2] A study by Partners in Care revealed that the recidivism rate for individuals in Hawai'i who received housing support was just 12.8% versus 50% without housing support. [2] By addressing housing insecurity and ensuring access to integrated support services, the measure will enable individuals with I/DD to live more independently and with dignity, reduce reliance on costly institutional care or emergency services, and improve overall health. [2] [2]",
  "policy_impact": "Your Committee has amended this measure by deleting language that would have established the Kauhale Initiative Special Fund. [3] The measure establishes the Supportive Housing Special Fund to be administered by the Hawai‘i Housing and Finance and Development Corporation to facilitate the development of mixed-income rental housing projects. [2] The committee also deleted language that attempted to prevent the proper lapse of a general fund appropriation at the end of the fiscal biennium for which the appropriation was made. [3]",
  "revenue_sources": "House Bill (H.B.) No. 431 appropriates $50,000,000 (HB431_TESTIMONY_HSH_01-28-25_.PDF.txt) in general funds in both FY 26 and FY 27 for the Kauhale Initiative. [2] The bill also appropriates $12,000,000 (HB431_TESTIMONY_HSH_01-28-25_.PDF.txt) in general funds in both FY 26 and FY 27 for deposit into the Supportive Housing Special Fund. [2] The Department of Budget and Finance noted that pursuant to the Constitution of the State of Hawai‘i, no general fund appropriation shall be made for a period exceeding three years. [2]",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The Committee on Finance is requested to consider an appropriation amount of $50,000,000 (HB431_HD1_HSCR3_.htm.txt) for the continued operation of the Kauhale Initiative for the fiscal biennium 2025-2027. [3] Testimony for the original bill specified an appropriation of $50,000,000 (HB431_TESTIMONY_HSH_01-28-25_.PDF.txt) in general funds in both FY 26 and FY 27. [2] The committee also requests consideration of $12,000,000 (HB431_HD1_HSCR3_.htm.txt) to be deposited into the Supportive Housing Special Fund. [3] This amount includes $11,810,250 (HB431_HD1_HSCR3_.htm.txt) for financing projects and services, and $189,750 (HB431_HD1_HSCR3_.htm.txt) for one temporary 1.0 FTE Housing Finance Specialist I. [3] [3] The Department of Budget and Finance noted that any general funds appropriated in FY 26 or FY 27 should lapse no later than June 30, 2028. [2] Your Committee amended the measure by deleting language that attempted to prevent the proper lapse of a general fund appropriation. [3] The Statewide Office on Homelessness and Housing Solutions goal is to build at least thirty Kauhale by November 2026. [2] The establishment of a special fund indicates a long-term initiative. [3] The Department of Human Services suggests that a recurring budget appropriation be made instead of establishing a special fund for the Kauhale Initiative. [2] There are no specified appropriations beyond the initial biennium, but continued operations will likely require future funding. [3]",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "As a matter of general policy, B&F does not support the creation of any special fund which does not meet the requirements of Section 37-52.3, HRS. [2] Special funds should demonstrate the capacity to be financially self-sustaining. [2] Regarding H.B. No. 431, it is difficult to determine how the proposed special fund would be self-sustaining. [2]",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The measure provides funds for the development of mixed-income rental housing projects. [3] The Committee on Finance is requested to consider allocating $11,810,250 (HB431_HD1_HSCR3_.htm.txt) for the financing of the development, operation, and maintenance of affordable, supportive housing projects. [3] Kauhale includes many housing types and is sometimes envisioned as tiny homes with shared bathrooms, dining, and cooking facilities, or they could be created in repurposed hotels, offices, buildings, dormitories, or apartment buildings. [2]",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The establishment of the Supportive Housing Special Fund implies an ongoing need for funding beyond the initial appropriation period. [3] The Department of Budget and Finance raised concerns about the ability of proposed special funds to be self-sustaining, which suggests a potential need for future general fund appropriations to support the program. [2] The Department of Human Services suggested a recurring budget appropriation to HMS 777 or other appropriate program ID be made instead of establishing a special fund for the Kauhale Initiative. [2] [2]",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The committee amended the measure by deleting language that would have established the Kauhale Initiative Special Fund. [3] Your Committee has amended this measure by changing the appropriations to unspecified amounts, though it requests the Committee on Finance consider the original figures. [3] [3] The committee also deleted language that attempted to prevent the proper lapse of a general fund appropriation at the end of the fiscal biennium. [3] Language was inserted that appropriates an unspecified amount to assist the Statewide Office on Homelessness and Housing Solutions in implementing the Kauhale Initiative, replacing the administration of the now-deleted special fund.
