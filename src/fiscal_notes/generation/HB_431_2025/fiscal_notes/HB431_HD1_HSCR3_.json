  "overview": "This measure appropriates funds for the continued operation of the Kauhale Initiative and establishes the Supportive Housing Special Fund to facilitate the development of mixed-income rental housing. The bill aims to provide housing and supportive services for vulnerable populations, including those with special needs. As amended, the measure removes the establishment of the Kauhale Initiative Special Fund and changes specific appropriation amounts to be unspecified, pending further discussion.",
  "appropriations": "While the bill was amended to unspecified amounts, testimony initially proposed appropriating $50,000,000 (HB431_TESTIMONY_HSH_01-28-25_) in general funds for fiscal year 2026 and $50,000,000 (HB431_TESTIMONY_HSH_01-28-25_) for fiscal year 2027 for the Kauhale Initiative. It also proposed depositing $12,000,000 (HB431_TESTIMONY_HSH_01-28-25_) in general funds into the new Supportive Housing Special Fund in each of fiscal years 2026 and 2027. A House committee report recommends funding for one temporary full-time equivalent Housing Finance Specialist I at a cost of $189,750 (HB431_HD1_HSCR3_) from the Supportive Housing Special Fund.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The funding request for the Kauhale Initiative aligns with the Governor's executive budget, which requested $50M (HB431_TESTIMONY_HSH_01-28-25_) in general funds per year for the Statewide Office on Homelessness & Housing Solutions. The projections are based on the goal of halving unsheltered homelessness and building at least thirty Kauhale projects by November 2026. The cost assumptions for the Supportive Housing Special Fund are derived from the need to create a new financing tool for developing mixed-income rental projects with integrated support services.",
  "agency_impact": "The measure now impacts the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation (HHFDC), which will administer the new Supportive Housing Special Fund. A committee report requests funding for one temporary full-time equivalent (1.0 FTE) Housing Finance Specialist I within the HHFDC at a cost of $189,750 (HB431_HD1_HSCR3_) to manage the fund. The Statewide Office on Homelessness and Housing Solutions testimony requests one full-time equivalent (1.0 FTE) Return to Home Homelessness Assistant position to help with program administration.",
  "economic_impact": "Testimony highlights significant potential cost savings by comparing the annual cost to house a person in a Kauhale at around $30,000 (HB431_TESTIMONY_HSH_01-28-25_) versus the cost of incarceration at $112,000 (HB431_TESTIMONY_HSH_01-28-25_) per year. The Return to Home program has potentially saved taxpayers $11.2 million (HB431_TESTIMONY_HSH_01-28-25_) by relocating 137 individuals, based on an estimated annual cost of $82,000 (HB431_TESTIMONY_HSH_01-28-25_) per person not in stable housing. Additionally, a study cited in testimony indicates housing support reduces the recidivism rate from 50% to 12.8% (HB431_TESTIMONY_HSH_01-28-25_).",
  "policy_impact": "This measure shifts policy by establishing the Supportive Housing Special Fund, creating a new state-level financing mechanism for developing mixed-income housing with integrated services administered by the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation. A proposed Kauhale Initiative Special Fund was deleted from the measure following testimony from the Department of Budget and Finance. This reflects a policy preference for direct appropriations for the Kauhale Initiative rather than creating a new special fund for its operations.",
  "revenue_sources": "The measure now specifies the revenue source for the proposed appropriations. Testimony from the Department of Budget and Finance indicates the bill appropriates $50,000,000 (HB431_TESTIMONY_HSH_01-28-25_) in general funds for the Kauhale Initiative. An additional $12,000,000 (HB431_TESTIMONY_HSH_01-28-25_) in general funds is appropriated for deposit into the Supportive Housing Special Fund.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The current two-year fiscal outlook, as proposed in testimony and committee reports, differs significantly from the previous version. For fiscal years 2026 and 2027, the measure proposes $50,000,000 (HB431_TESTIMONY_HSH_01-28-25_) per year in general funds for the Kauhale Initiative. It also proposes $12,000,000 (HB431_TESTIMONY_HSH_01-28-25_) per year in general funds for the Supportive Housing Special Fund (SHSF), for a total annual appropriation of $62,000,000 (HB431_TESTIMONY_HSH_01-28-25_). From the SHSF, a committee recommends allocating $11,810,250 (HB431_HD1_HSCR3_) annually for supportive housing projects and $189,750 (HB431_HD1_HSCR3_) annually for one temporary FTE position to administer the fund. The Department of Budget and Finance noted that any general funds appropriated in FY 26 or FY 27 should lapse no later than June 30, 2028. No projections beyond this two-year period are provided.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "This measure explicitly directs funds toward capital expenditures for housing development. The newly established Supportive Housing Special Fund is intended to facilitate the development of mixed-income rental housing projects. A committee report recommends $11,810,250 (HB431_HD1_HSCR3_) be used for financing the development, operation, and maintenance of these affordable, supportive housing projects.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The establishment of the Supportive Housing Special Fund creates an ongoing fiscal obligation, as the fund will require administration and potential replenishment to continue financing new housing developments. The stated goal of establishing at least thirty Kauhale projects by 2026 implies recurring operational and maintenance costs that will extend beyond the initial appropriation period. These long-term costs will be necessary to sustain the housing and support services provided by these initiatives.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The scope of the bill has changed from funding the Ohana Zones Program to establishing a new Supportive Housing Special Fund administered by the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation. Appropriation amounts are substantially different, with testimony proposing $50,000,000 (HB431_TESTIMONY_HSH_01-28-25_) annually for the Kauhale Initiative and $12,000,000 (HB431_TESTIMONY_HSH_01-28-25_) annually for the new special fund, with the revenue source now identified as general funds. A proposal to create a Kauhale Initiative Special Fund was removed, and a new temporary FTE position within the HHFDC is now requested. New economic data has been introduced, comparing the costs of Kauhale housing to incarceration and quantifying savings from the Return to Home program."
