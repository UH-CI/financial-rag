  "overview": "The purpose of this measure is to appropriate funds for the continued operation of the Kauhale Initiative and to establish and appropriate funds into and out of the Supportive Housing Special Fund to assist the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation in facilitating the development of mixed-income rental housing projects (HB431_HD1). This measure represents a critical step forward in meeting the housing needs of Hawaii's most vulnerable populations by providing additional funds for these initiatives (HB431_HD1). It also aims to support partnerships between government and the community to create an effective, efficient, and transparent system for developers, service providers, and individuals with special housing needs (HB431_HD1).",
  "appropriations": "While the measure was amended to change appropriations to unspecified amounts, the Committee on Human Services & Homelessness respectfully requests the Committee on Finance to consider an appropriation of $50,000,000 (HB431_HD1) for the continued operation of the Kauhale Initiative. It also requests consideration of $12,000,000 (HB431_HD1) to be deposited into the Supportive Housing Special Fund (HB431_HD1). Of this amount, $11,810,250 (HB431_HD1) is for financing the development, operation, and maintenance of supportive housing projects and services, and $189,750 (HB431_HD1) is for one temporary full-time equivalent (1.0 FTE) Housing Finance Specialist I position (HB431_HD1).",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal projections are based on amounts requested for consideration by the House Committee on Finance as detailed in the standing committee report for H.B. No. 431, H.D. 1 (HB431_HD1). The report proposes an appropriation of $50,000,000 (HB431_HD1) for the Kauhale Initiative and $12,000,000 (HB431_HD1) for the Supportive Housing Special Fund (HB431_HD1). The cost for the new position is specified as $189,750 (HB431_HD1), but the documents do not provide a detailed breakdown or methodology for how these overall funding levels were determined.",
  "agency_impact": "The Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation (HHFDC) supports the establishment of one full-time equivalent (1.0 FTE) housing finance specialist I position to help with the administration of the supportive housing special fund (HB431_HD1_TESTIMONY_HSG_02-12-25_). The State Procurement Office recommends that procurement exemption language be removed, stating that exemptions mean procurements made with taxpayer monies will not have the same oversight, accountability and transparency requirements (HB431_HD1_TESTIMONY_HSG_02-12-25_). The Department of Budget and Finance does not support the creation of any special fund which does not meet the requirements of Section 37-52.3, HRS, and notes it is difficult to determine whether the proposed fund would be self-sustaining (HB431_HD1_TESTIMONY_HSG_02-12-25_).",
  "economic_impact": "Testimony from the Office of Hawaiian Affairs indicates that supportive housing has significant economic benefits, citing a finding that people offered supportive housing spent 23% fewer days in hospitals and had 33% fewer emergency room visits (HB431_HD1_TESTIMONY_HSG_02-12-25_). The same testimony notes that supportive housing reduces recidivism, referencing a study showing the rate for individuals with housing support was 12.8% versus 50% without (HB431_HD1_TESTIMONY_HSG_02-12-25_). This suggests the measure could lower cost burdens on public healthcare and incarceration systems.",
  "policy_impact": "This measure establishes the Supportive Housing Special Fund to be administered by the Hawai‘i Housing Finance and Development Corporation to facilitate the development of mixed-income rental housing projects (HB431_HD1). A key amendment in this version of the bill was deleting language that would have established a separate Kauhale Initiative Special Fund (HB431_HD1). The committee also inserted language that appropriates an unspecified amount to assist the Statewide Office on Homelessness and Housing Solutions in implementing the Kauhale Initiative (HB431_HD1).",
  "revenue_sources": "The measure appropriates an unspecified amount of general funds in both FY 26 and FY 27 to the Office of the Governor for the Kauhale Initiative (HB431_HD1_TESTIMONY_HSG_02-12-25_). It also appropriates an unspecified amount of general funds in both fiscal years for deposit into the Supportive Housing Special Fund (HB431_HD1_TESTIMONY_HSG_02-12-25_). The Department of Budget and Finance testimony suggests the fund is not designed to be financially self-sustaining and would rely on these general fund appropriations (HB431_HD1_TESTIMONY_HSG_02-12-25_).",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The measure signals continued significant state investment in homelessness solutions, following a history of substantial appropriations. Previously, the ohana zones pilot program was initially appropriated $30,000,000 (HB431_HD1_.HTM.txt), with subsequent acts providing $2,000,000 (HB431_HD1_.HTM.txt), $15,000,000 (HB431_HD1_.HTM.txt), and $5,000,000 (HB431_HD1_.HTM.txt) for related programs (HB431_HD1_.HTM.txt). In 2023, the legislature also appropriated $25,000,000 (HB431_HD1_.HTM.txt) to fund the kauhale initiative (HB431_HD1_.HTM.txt). This bill requests consideration of $50,000,000 (HB431_HD1) for the Kauhale Initiative and $12,000,000 (HB431_HD1) for the new Supportive Housing Special Fund (HB431_HD1). A recurring administrative cost will be the temporary Housing Finance Specialist I position at a cost of $189,750 (HB431_HD1). Given the ongoing nature of the housing crisis, similar levels of funding requests can be anticipated in subsequent fiscal years to sustain program operations and expand capacity.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The provided documents for this version of the bill do not specify any new sources of operating revenue. The Department of Budget and Finance testimony notes that it is \"difficult to determine whether the proposed SHSF would be self-sustaining\" (HB431_HD1_TESTIMONY_HSG_02-12-25_), indicating an expected reliance on general fund appropriations rather than self-generated revenue. Therefore, no direct impact on operating revenue is anticipated from this measure.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The measure is expected to have a significant impact on capital expenditures, as the Supportive Housing Special Fund is intended for the \"financing of the development, operation, and maintenance of affordable, supportive housing projects\" (HB431_HD1). Testimony from the County of Hawai‘i Office of Housing and Community Development identifies potential projects, including funding for the second phase of Kukuiola Village for the construction of 50 permanent supportive housing units (HB431_HD1_TESTIMONY_HSG_02-12-25_). The funds could also assist with the \"renovation and upgrades of the former Hilo Memorial Hospital\" (HB431_HD1_TESTIMONY_HSG_02-12-25_).",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The establishment of the Supportive Housing Special Fund and the continued funding for the Kauhale Initiative imply ongoing fiscal commitments beyond the initial six-year period. These long-term obligations will likely include recurring requests for general fund appropriations to maintain operations, provide supportive services, and develop new housing units. The administrative cost for the HHFDC staff position, while designated as temporary, may become a recurring expense if the program's responsibilities continue.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "This fiscal note differs significantly from the previous version by providing specific requested appropriation amounts instead of unspecified sums. The committee report for H.D. 1 requests consideration of $50,000,000 (HB431_HD1) for the Kauhale Initiative and $12,000,000 (HB431_HD1) for the Supportive Housing Special Fund, with the FTE cost updated to $189,750 (HB431_HD1). A key policy change is the deletion of the previously proposed \"Kauhale Initiative Special Fund\" (HB431_HD1), which is a new development. This note also includes new agency impact information from the Department of Budget and Finance, which expressed concerns about the special fund's ability to be self-sustaining (HB431_HD1_TESTIMONY_HSG_02-12-25_)."
