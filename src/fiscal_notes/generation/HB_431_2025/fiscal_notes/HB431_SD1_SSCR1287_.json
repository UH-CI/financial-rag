  "overview": "This measure has been significantly amended, with the most notable change being the deletion of the proposed Supportive Housing Special Fund, which is now replaced with a direct appropriation to the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation (HB431_SD1). The bill also removes the controversial two-bidder requirement for large Kauhale projects and adds a separate appropriation for the Ohana Zones Pilot Program (HB431_SD1). The core intent to fund the Kauhale Initiative and supportive housing remains, but through a different funding structure.",
  "appropriations": "The appropriation structure has been substantially altered; the bill no longer creates or deposits funds into the Supportive Housing Special Fund (HB431_SD1). Instead, it now contains a blank appropriation to be expended directly by the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation for supportive housing projects (HB431_SD1). Additionally, a new blank appropriation has been inserted for the continued implementation of the Ohana Zones Pilot Program (HB431_SD1).",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The financial methodology has shifted away from the special fund model, rendering previous concerns about the fund's self-sustainability moot. The financial projections are now based on direct general fund appropriations for three separate purposes: the Kauhale Initiative, the Ohana Zones Pilot Program, and HHFDC-managed supportive housing projects (HB431_SD1). This change aligns the bill with the concerns previously raised by the Department of Budget and Finance (HB431_HD2_TESTIMONY_HHS-HOU_03-12-25_).",
  "agency_impact": "The Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation's role has been revised; it will now manage a direct appropriation for supportive housing rather than administering a new special fund (HB431_SD1). The operational concerns raised by the Department of Human Services have been addressed, as the legislature deleted the requirement for at least two bidders for any Kauhale project estimated to be over $1,000,000 (HB431_SD1). The Governor's authority to transfer Kauhale appropriations to other agencies has also been removed (HB431_SD1).",
  "economic_impact": "The measure now distinctly funds the Ohana Zones Pilot Program in addition to the Kauhale Initiative, potentially broadening the economic benefits to communities served by both programs (HB431_SD1). While the underlying goal of reducing homelessness and associated costs remains, the funding mechanism has been simplified to a direct appropriation instead of a special fund (HB431_SD1). This change streamlines the flow of funds for developing supportive housing.",
  "policy_impact": "The bill reflects a major policy shift away from creating new special funds, as the legislature deleted the Supportive Housing Special Fund in its entirety (HB431_SD1). This aligns with testimony from the Department of Budget and Finance, which questioned the fund's ability to be self-sustaining (HB431_HD2_TESTIMONY_HHS-HOU_03-12-25_). Furthermore, the measure adopts the recommendation from the Department of Human Services by removing the two-bidder procurement requirement for large Kauhale projects (HB431_SD1).",
  "revenue_sources": "The revenue structure has been simplified, as the Supportive Housing Special Fund and its associated revenue mechanism have been deleted (HB431_SD1). The measure now relies exclusively on direct appropriations from general funds for three separate items. These include the Kauhale Initiative, the Ohana Zones Pilot Program, and supportive housing projects managed by the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation (HB431_SD1).",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The provision requiring at least two bidders for any Kauhale project with an estimated cost over $1,000,000 (HB431_SD1) has been deleted from the measure. This amendment directly responds to testimony from the Department of Human Services, which raised concerns that the requirement could delay project development in certain communities (HB431_HD2_TESTIMONY_HHS-HOU_03-12-25_). This change reverts the procurement process for such projects to the standard state procurement code or other applicable exemptions.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The bill has been substantially amended, primarily through the deletion of the Supportive Housing Special Fund, which is replaced by a direct general fund appropriation to the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation (HB431_SD1). Responding to agency testimony, the legislature also removed the two-bidder requirement for Kauhale projects over $1,000,000 (HB431_SD1). A new, separate appropriation for the Ohana Zones Pilot Program was also added, distinguishing its funding from the Kauhale Initiative (HB431_SD1)."
