  "assumptions_and_methodology": "As a matter of general policy, the Department of Budget and Finance (B&F) does not support the creation of any special fund which does not meet the requirements of Section 37-52.3, HRS. [10] Regarding H.B. No. 431, H.D. 2, it is difficult to determine whether the proposed SHSF would be self-sustaining. [10] Your Committees note that this measure contains unspecified appropriation amounts and respectfully request that the Office of the Governor provide to your Committee on Ways and Means the amounts necessary for the programs. [11] [11]",
  "agency_impact": "The Department of Human Services (DHS) and the Statewide Office on Homelessness and Housing Solutions (SOHHS) requested the deletion of the provision requiring at least two bidders for any Kauhale project with an estimated cost of over $1,000,000 (HB431_HD2_TESTIMONY_HHS-HOU_03-12-25_.PDF.txt). [10] [10] The State Procurement Office (SPO) recommends that the procurement exemption language for selecting a qualified private or nonprofit organization to assist with supportive housing be removed. [10] [10] The Department of Budget and Finance does not support the creation of any special fund which does not meet statutory requirements. [10]",
  "economic_impact": "A study by Hawaii based organization Partners in Care revealed that the recidivism rate for individuals who received housing support was 12.8% versus 50% without housing support.

[10] Currently, we have 18 Kauhale active across the state and have a goal to establish 30 kauhale villages by the end of 2026. [10]",

[11] The amended measure also deletes language that would have provided that there shall be at least two bidders for any kauhale project estimated to be over $1,000,000 (HB431_SD1_SSCR1287_.htm.txt).

[10]",
  "revenue_sources": "The bill appropriates an unspecified amount of general funds in both FY 26 and FY 27 to the Office of the Governor for the continued operation of the Kauhale Initiative. [10] The amended measure deletes the Supportive Housing Special Fund, which would have been a source of revenue. [11] Instead, the bill inserts blank general fund appropriations for the Ohana Zones Pilot Program and for supportive housing projects administered by the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation. [11] [11]",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The Hawai ªi State Legislature previously appropriated $33 million (HB431_HD2_TESTIMONY_HHS-HOU_03-12-25_.PDF.txt) for FY25 for kauhale initiatives. [10] This measure appropriates an unspecified amount of general funds in both FY 26 and FY 27 for the continued operation of the Kauhale Initiative. [10] It also inserts a blank appropriation amount for the continued implementation of the Ohana Zones Pilot Program. [11] A blank appropriation amount will also be expended by the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation for the development, operation, and maintenance of affordable, supportive housing projects. [11] The Statewide Office on Homelessness and Housing Solutions has a goal to establish 30 kauhale villages by the end of 2026, which implies program expansion. [10] The Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation requested $175,000 (HB431_HD2_TESTIMONY_HHS-HOU_03-12-25_.PDF.txt) for one full-time equivalent (1.0 FTE) housing finance specialist I position. [10] This position was requested to help administer the supportive housing special fund. [10] Since the Supportive Housing Special Fund was deleted from the measure, the programs will be reliant on future general fund appropriations for sustainability. [11] The Committees have requested the Office of the Governor provide the necessary funding amounts to the Committee on Ways and Means. [11]",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The amended measure deletes the language that would have established a Supportive Housing Special Fund. [11] This removes the potential revenue streams that would have been associated with the fund, such as fees or loan repayments.

[11] Funding is also provided for the development, operation, and maintenance of affordable, supportive housing projects.

  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The measure has been significantly amended since the previous fiscal note. [11] Language that would have established the Supportive Housing Special Fund to be administered by the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation has been deleted.
