  "overview": "The purpose of this Act is to appropriate funds for the continued implementation of the kauhale initiative and the ohana zones pilot program. [11] It also appropriates funds for the development, operation, and maintenance of affordable, supportive housing projects and the provision of supportive services for households with special needs. [11] This measure provides funding to further expand affordable housing inventory and supportive services for individuals experiencing or at the risk of homelessness throughout the State. [12]",
  "appropriations": "The bill appropriates an unspecified sum out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii for fiscal year 2025-2026 and the same sum for fiscal year 2026-2027 for the continued operation of the kauhale initiative. [11] It also appropriates an unspecified sum for the same fiscal years for the continued implementation of the ohana zones pilot program. [11] A third unspecified appropriation for the same fiscal years is made to the Hawaii housing finance and development corporation for the development, operation, and maintenance of affordable, supportive housing projects. [11]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal note is based on the legislative finding that it is necessary for the State to develop the capacity of its affordable housing financing and development agency to work with developers to create additional supportive housing units. [11] It assumes continued funding is needed for the Ohana Zones Pilot Program and the Kauhale Initiative, which aim to provide supportive housing and services with an emphasis on community-based solutions. [12] Historical appropriations include $30,000,000 (HB431_SD1_.HTM.txt) initially for the ohana zones pilot program, $15,000,000 (HB431_SD1_.HTM.txt) for an extension, and $25,000,000 (HB431_SD1_.HTM.txt) for the kauhale initiative, which informs the scale of potential funding. [11] [11] [11]",
  "agency_impact": "The sums appropriated for the kauhale initiative and the ohana zones pilot program shall be expended by the office of the governor. [11] [11] The sums appropriated for supportive housing projects shall be expended by the Hawaii housing finance and development corporation. [11] Language that would have allowed the Governor to transfer appropriations for the Kauhale Initiative to other executive branch departments or agencies was deleted. [12] [12]",
  "economic_impact": "The legislature finds that Hawaii has the highest homelessness rate per capita in the nation. [11] This measure aims to expand affordable housing inventory and supportive services for individuals experiencing or at the risk of homelessness throughout the State. [12] Funding the kauhale initiative is intended to create deeply affordable spaces for housing and healing the houseless. [11]",
  "policy_impact": "This measure continues funding for both the Ohana Zones Pilot Program and the Kauhale Initiative. [12] It amends a previous version by deleting language that would have established a Supportive Housing Special Fund. [12] Instead, it now provides a direct appropriation to the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation for the development of supportive housing projects. [12]",
  "revenue_sources": "Appropriations for the kauhale initiative, the ohana zones pilot program, and the supportive housing projects are made out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii. [11] [11] [11] The bill does not identify other revenue sources. [11] [11] [11] The previous proposal to create a Supportive Housing Special Fund, which could have had its own revenue mechanisms, was deleted. [12]",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The bill appropriates unspecified sums from the general fund for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027 for three distinct purposes: the kauhale initiative, the ohana zones pilot program, and HHFDC supportive housing projects. [11] [11] [11] While the amounts are blank, historical context suggests significant investment. [12] The ohana zones pilot program was initially appropriated $30,000,000 (HB431_SD1_.HTM.txt), with subsequent appropriations of $2,000,000 (HB431_SD1_.HTM.txt) and $15,000,000 (HB431_SD1_.HTM.txt). [11] [11] [11] In 2023, the legislature set aside $25,000,000 (HB431_SD1_.HTM.txt) for the kauhale initiative. [11] A supportive housing pilot program in 2023 was also funded with $5,000,000 (HB431_SD1_.HTM.txt). [11] [11] The continued implementation of these programs implies ongoing annual costs for operations, rent supplements, support services, and administration. [11] The development of new supportive housing projects by HHFDC will represent a significant capital investment. [11] Given the extension of the ohana zones pilot program to 2026 and the ongoing nature of the kauhale initiative, these programs will likely require appropriations beyond the two fiscal years in the bill, creating a multi-year fiscal commitment. [11] [11] The Committees requested that the Office of the Governor provide the necessary amounts for these initiatives to the Committee on Ways and Means. [12] [12]",

  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The measure appropriates funds for the development, operation, and maintenance of affordable, supportive housing projects. [11] The funds for the kauhale initiative include expenses related to the development and operation of kauhale. [11] Historically, ohana zone funds were appropriated for the construction of modular temporary units and renovation of existing structures. [11]",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The bill supports long-term solutions to homelessness such as supportive housing and affordable housing. [11] The continued implementation of the Kauhale Initiative and Ohana Zones Pilot Program, along with the development of new supportive housing, will likely require sustained funding beyond the initial two-year appropriation period. [12] These initiatives represent an ongoing fiscal commitment to address the State's high rate of homelessness. [11]",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "This version of the measure has been significantly amended from the previous version which focused on creating a Supportive Housing Special Fund. [12] Key changes include deleting the language that would have established the Supportive Housing Special Fund and its associated appropriations. [12] The amended measure now inserts a blank appropriation to be directly expended by the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation for supportive housing projects. [12] Additionally, language that would have allowed Kauhale Initiative funds to be used for the Ohana Zones Pilot Program was deleted, creating separate funding streams for each program. [12] Language authorizing the Governor to transfer Kauhale Initiative appropriations to other departments was also deleted. [12]",
  "fte_positions": "The provided documents do not contain information regarding Full Time Equivalent (FTE) positions, although appropriations for the kauhale initiative include funding for staffing and related costs to administer the initiative. [11]",
  "appropriations_changes": "The measure was amended to delete language that would have made appropriations into and out of a new Supportive Housing Special Fund. [12] In its place, the bill now inserts a blank appropriation amount for the continued implementation of the Ohana Zones Pilot Program and a separate blank appropriation amount for supportive housing projects to be expended by the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation. [12] [12] This clarifies three distinct, though unspecified, appropriations for the Kauhale Initiative, Ohana Zones, and HHFDC supportive housing. [11] [11] [11]",
  "funding_sources_changes": "The funding source remains the general revenues of the State of Hawaii. [11] [11] [11] The primary change is the method of funding for supportive housing; instead of capitalizing a new special fund, this version provides for a direct general fund appropriation to the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation. [12] [12]",
  "department_impact": "The Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation is no longer tasked with administering a new Supportive Housing Special Fund, as that provision was deleted. [12] Instead, the corporation is now the expending agency for a direct appropriation for the development, operation, and maintenance of affordable, supportive housing projects. [11] The office of the governor remains the expending agency for funds for the kauhale initiative and the ohana zones pilot program. [11] [11]",

  "pilot_program": "The bill provides for the continued implementation of the ohana zones pilot program established under Act 209, Session Laws of Hawaii 2018. [11] The ohana zones pilot program was extended from 2021 to 2023. [11] Act 235, Session Laws of Hawaii 2022, further extended the ohana zones pilot program through June 30, 2026. [11]",
  "sunset_date": "Act 235, Session Laws of Hawaii 2022, extended the ohana zones pilot program through June 30, 2026. [11] This bill does not contain a sunset date for its own provisions. [11]",
