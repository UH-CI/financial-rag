  "overview": "This measure provides funding for the continued implementation of the Ohana Zones Pilot Program and the Kauhale Initiative, in addition to funding for the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation for the development, operation, and maintenance of affordable, supportive housing projects. [12] The purpose of this Act is to appropriate funds for the continued implementation of the kauhale initiative and the ohana zones pilot program. [11] The bill also appropriates funds to the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation for the development of supportive housing projects and provision of supportive services for certain households in the supportive housing projects. [11]",
  "appropriations": "The bill appropriates an unspecified amount of general revenues for fiscal year 2025-2026 and 2026-2027 for the continued operation of the kauhale initiative. [11] It also appropriates a blank amount for the continued implementation of the Ohana Zones Pilot Program. [12] Your Committees respectfully request that the Office of the Governor provide to your Committee on Ways and Means the amounts necessary for the continued implementation of the Kauhale Initiative and Ohana Zones Pilot Program respectively. [12]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "This measure contains unspecified appropriation amounts. [12] The Committees on Health and Human Services and Housing have requested that the Office of the Governor provide the amounts necessary for the continued implementation of the Kauhale Initiative and Ohana Zones Pilot Program. [12] The fiscal impact is contingent upon the blank appropriation amounts being determined by the Legislature. [12] [12]",
  "agency_impact": "Your Committees have amended this measure by deleting language that would have provided that if funds appropriated for the continued implementation of the Kauhale Initiative are used to contract for the procurement of building services and projects related to the Kauhale Initiative, there shall be at least two bidders for any kauhale project estimated to be over $1,000,000 (the committee hearing determines $1,000,000 (HB431_SD1_SSCR1287_.htm.txt)). [12] [12] This amendment addresses the previously stated concern from the Department of Human Services that a two-bid minimum may delay project development. [10] The deletion of the Supportive Housing Special Fund also removes the procurement exemption that was a concern for the State Procurement Office. [12] [10]",
  "economic_impact": "",
  "policy_impact": "The Committees have amended this measure by deleting language that would have established a Supportive Housing Special Fund to be administered by the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation. [12] This amendment removes the creation of a new special fund, which was a policy concern for the Department of Budget and Finance. [10] Language requiring at least two bidders for any kauhale project estimated to be over $1,000,000 (the committee hearing determines $1,000,000 (HB431_SD1_SSCR1287_.htm.txt)) was also deleted. [12]",
  "revenue_sources": "There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii an unspecified sum for fiscal year 2025-2026 and 2026-2027 for the continued operation of the kauhale initiative. [11] [11] An unspecified sum is also appropriated from general revenues for the continued implementation of the ohana zones pilot program. [11] Further general revenue appropriations are made for the development, operation, and maintenance of affordable, supportive housing projects. [11] [11]",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The bill appropriates unspecified sums out of the general revenues for fiscal year 2025-2026 and fiscal year 2026-2027 for three distinct purposes: the continued operation of the kauhale initiative, the continued implementation of the ohana zones pilot program, and for the development, operation, and maintenance of affordable, supportive housing projects. [11] [11] [11] These sums are to be expended by the office of the governor and the Hawaii housing finance and development corporation, respectively. [11] [11] [11] The previous request from HHFDC for $175,000 (Public testimony requests $175,000 (HB431_HD2_TESTIMONY_HHS-HOU_03-12-25_.PDF.txt)) for one full-time equivalent position to administer the supportive housing special fund is no longer applicable as the special fund has been deleted from the measure. [10] [12] The concern regarding a two-bid minimum for projects over $1,000,000 (the committee hearing determines $1,000,000 (HB431_SD1_SSCR1287_.htm.txt)) has also been addressed by deleting the requirement. [12] The long-term fiscal implications will depend on the amounts inserted into the blank appropriations and any subsequent funding provided by the legislature in future biennia. [12]",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The amended measure deleted language that would have required at least two bidders for any kauhale project estimated to be over $1,000,000 (the committee hearing determines $1,000,000 (HB431_SD1_SSCR1287_.htm.txt)). [12] This removes a specific procurement requirement for capital projects related to the Kauhale Initiative. [12] The bill appropriates funds for the development of supportive housing units, which could be in stand-alone projects or integrated in mixed-income rental housing projects. [11]",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The bill provides appropriations for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027 only. [11] [11] [11] With the deletion of the Supportive Housing Special Fund, there is no ongoing, self-sustaining funding mechanism established by this measure. [12] Continued implementation of the Kauhale Initiative, Ohana Zones Pilot Program, and supportive housing development would be dependent on future appropriations from the legislature. [11]",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The latest version of the bill has been significantly amended, resulting in several key changes from the previous fiscal note. [12] The Supportive Housing Special Fund has been deleted, which eliminates the basis for the previously requested $175,000 (Public testimony requests $175,000 (HB431_HD2_TESTIMONY_HHS-HOU_03-12-25_.PDF.txt)) FTE position and addresses the Department of Budget and Finance's policy concerns. [12] [10] The bill now contains unspecified general fund appropriations for the Kauhale Initiative, Ohana Zones, and HHFDC supportive housing projects. [12] The provision requiring at least two bidders for Kauhale projects over $1,000,000 (the committee hearing determines $1,000,000 (HB431_SD1_SSCR1287_.htm.txt)), a concern for the Department of Human Services, has been removed.
