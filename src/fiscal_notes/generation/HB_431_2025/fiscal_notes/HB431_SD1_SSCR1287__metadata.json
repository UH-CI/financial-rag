[CHUNK_14] It assumes continued funding is needed for the Ohana Zones Pilot Program and the Kauhale Initiative, which aim to provide supportive housing and services with an emphasis on community-based solutions. [CHUNK_40] Historical appropriations include $30,000,000 (HB431_SD1_.HTM.txt) initially for the ohana zones pilot program, $15,000,000 (HB431_SD1_.HTM.txt) for an extension, and $25,000,000 (HB431_SD1_.HTM.txt) for the kauhale initiative, which informs the scale of potential funding.

[CHUNK_17, CHUNK_21, CHUNK_27] While the amounts are blank, historical context suggests significant investment. [CHUNK_50] The ohana zones pilot program was initially appropriated $30,000,000 (HB431_SD1_.HTM.txt), with subsequent appropriations of $2,000,000 (HB431_SD1_.HTM.txt) and $15,000,000 (HB431_SD1_.HTM.txt). [CHUNK_3, CHUNK_4, CHUNK_6] In 2023, the legislature set aside $25,000,000 (HB431_SD1_.HTM.txt) for the kauhale initiative. [CHUNK_8] A supportive housing pilot program in 2023 was also funded with $5,000,000 (HB431_SD1_.HTM.txt). [CHUNK_6, CHUNK_7] The continued implementation of these programs implies ongoing annual costs for operations, rent supplements, support services, and administration. [CHUNK_18] The development of new supportive housing projects by HHFDC will represent a significant capital investment. [CHUNK_25] Given the extension of the ohana zones pilot program to 2026 and the ongoing nature of the kauhale initiative, these programs will likely require appropriations beyond the two fiscal years in the bill, creating a multi-year fiscal commitment.
