The bill appropriates funds to the Office of the Governor for the \\\"continued implementation of the Kauhale Initiative and Ohana Zones Pilot Program\\\" (HB431_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-28-25_). It also appropriates funds to the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation (HHFDC) for the \\\"development of supportive housing projects and provision of supportive services for certain households\\\" (HB431_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-28-25_).\",\n\"appropriations\": \"This measure contains unspecified appropriation amounts (HB431_SD1). The legislative document inserts a blank appropriation amount for the \\\"continued implementation of the Ohana Zones Pilot Program\\\" (HB431_SD1) and a blank appropriation amount to be expended by the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation for supportive housing projects (HB431_SD1). Testimony from HHFDC requests $175,000 (HB431_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-28-25_.PDF.txt) for one full-time equivalent (1.0 FTE) housing finance specialist position to help administer the provisions of the bill (HB431_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-28-25_).\",\n\"assumptions_and_methodology\": \"The measure contains unspecified appropriation amounts, and as such, detailed financial projections are not provided (HB431_SD1).

The Department of Human Services supports the measure but requests that any appropriation align with the executive budget and not reduce or replace other budget priorities (HB431_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-28-25_).\",\n\"economic_impact\": \"Testimony from the Office of the Governor states that \\\"by providing housing for chronically homeless individuals will not only improve overall health outcomes but will also help to save taxpayers millions of dollars in health care costs\\\" (HB431_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-28-25_). The State Council on Developmental Disabilities notes the bill will \\\"reduce reliance on costly institutional care or emergency services, and improve overall health, social inclusion, and quality of life for individuals with I/DD\\\" (HB431_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-28-25_). This measure is intended to \\\"expand affordable housing inventory and supportive services for individuals experiencing or at the risk of homelessness throughout the State\\\" (HB431_SD1).\",\n\"policy_impact\": \"The Committees have amended this measure by \\\"Deleting language that would have allowed funds appropriated for the continued implementation of the Kauhale Initiative to be used for the Ohana Zones Pilot Program\\\" (HB431_SD1). The measure also deletes language that would have established a Supportive Housing Special Fund, instead inserting a blank appropriation to be expended by the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation for supportive housing projects (HB431_SD1). It also deletes language that would have set procurement requirements for kauhale projects estimated to be over $1,000,000 (HB431_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-28-25_.PDF.txt) (HB431_SD1).\",\n\"revenue_sources\": \"The provided documents do not explicitly state the revenue source for the appropriations in this version of the bill. However, testimony regarding a previous version of the measure refers to a \\\"general fund appropriation\\\" (HB431_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-28-25_). Typically, unspecified state appropriations are drawn from the general revenues of the State.\",\n\"six_year_fiscal_implications\": \"Although the bill contains unspecified appropriations, testimony provides context for potential funding levels. The legislative document notes the ohana zones pilot program initially appropriated $30,000,000 (HB431_SD1_.HTM.txt), with subsequent appropriations of $15,000,000 (HB431_SD1_.HTM.txt) and $5,000,000 (HB431_SD1_.HTM.txt) for extensions (HB431_SD1_.HTM.txt). Testimony from the Office of the Governor indicates the Governorâ€™s Executive Biennium Budget requested $50.00 (HB431_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-28-25_.PDF.txt) million each year for Fiscal Years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027 for the Kauhale Initiative (HB431_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-28-25_). The Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation has requested recurring funds for a permanent staff position, seeking $175,000 (HB431_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-28-25_.PDF.txt) for one full-time housing finance specialist (HB431_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-28-25_). The purpose of the funds is for the \\\"development, operation, and maintenance of affordable, supportive housing projects and the provision of supportive services\\\" (HB431_SD1), indicating significant and ongoing costs for both capital development and operations over the next six years. The Governor's goal is to establish 30 kauhale villages across the state by the end of 2026, suggesting an acceleration of expenditures if funded (HB431_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-28-25_).

Testimony regarding the Kauhale Initiative describes the development of \\\"communal villages of tiny homes,\\\" another form of capital expenditure (HB431_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-28-25_).\",\n\"fiscal_implications_after_6_years\": \"The fiscal implications after six years would consist of ongoing operational costs for the housing projects developed under the Ohana Zones Pilot Program and by the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation. These recurring costs include maintenance, management, and the provision of supportive services for residents. The request for a permanent FTE position by the HHFDC indicates that administrative costs are also expected to be permanent and ongoing (HB431_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-28-25_).\",\n\"updates_from_previous_fiscal_note\": \"This fiscal note is updated to reflect significant amendments to the measure. A key change is the deletion of language that would have established a Supportive Housing Special Fund; this is replaced with a direct blank appropriation to the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation for supportive housing projects (HB431_SD1). The measure no longer contains policy requirements for kauhale projects to be connected to public utilities or for rent charges to be capped, which were included in the previous version. Furthermore, this version separates funding streams by inserting distinct blank appropriations for the Ohana Zones Pilot Program and HHFDC's supportive housing projects, whereas the prior version was more consolidated (HB431_SD1). The expending agency for the Ohana Zones program appears to remain with the Office of the Governor, differing from the previous note which indicated a shift to the Department of Human Services.\"\n}",
