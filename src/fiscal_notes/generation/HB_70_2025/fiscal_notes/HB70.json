  "overview": "This bill amends existing law to enhance financial transparency for condominium unit owners regarding their association's replacement reserves. It mandates that budget summaries must contain all required information without reference to other documents. The measure also explicitly grants unit owners legal standing to file a lawsuit to enforce compliance with budget summary and reserve study requirements.",
  "appropriations": "This measure does not appropriate any funds. It is a regulatory bill focused on amending disclosure and enforcement provisions within condominium law. Therefore, there are no associated fiscal years, amounts, or intended uses for state funds.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "This fiscal note does not contain financial projections, as the bill does not have a direct fiscal impact on the State. The measure amends legal statutes related to condominium governance and does not involve the expenditure of public funds. Consequently, no assumptions or cost estimation methods were required.",
  "agency_impact": "This measure is not anticipated to have any operational, administrative, or budgetary impact on any government agency or department. The bill's provisions apply directly to condominium associations and unit owners, regulating their internal governance and financial disclosures. No additional state supervision, staffing, or resource allocation is required.",
  "economic_impact": "This bill is not expected to have a direct economic impact on the State of Hawaii. Its purpose is to improve the financial health and transparency of condominium associations by ensuring reserve studies and budgets are clear and enforceable. This may lead to better-funded reserves, potentially preventing future large special assessments on unit owners.",
  "policy_impact": "This bill amends section 514B-148, Hawaii Revised Statutes, to strengthen policies enacted by previous legislation. It modifies existing law by requiring budget summaries to be self-contained and by clarifying a unit owner's right to take legal action against their association's board for non-compliance. This shifts the enforcement mechanism to be more direct for unit owners.",
  "revenue_sources": "This measure does not create, require, or identify any revenue sources. The bill does not establish any new programs or positions that would necessitate funding. All compliance costs are borne by the condominium associations.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "This measure has no fiscal implications for the State of Hawaii over the next six years. The bill does not require any state expenditures, create any new state positions, or establish any programs that would incur costs for the government. It exclusively modifies the legal framework governing condominium associations, with compliance costs borne by the associations themselves. Therefore, there are no projected costs, staffing changes, or recurring expenses for the state to consider in a multi-year fiscal outlook.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "This measure is not anticipated to have any impact on the State's operating revenues. The bill does not create or modify any fees, taxes, or other revenue streams payable to the state. Its focus is on the financial governance of private condominium associations.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "This measure does not require any capital expenditures by the State. The bill's provisions do not involve the construction or acquisition of facilities, equipment, or technology infrastructure for any government agency. Therefore, there are no capital costs associated with this legislation.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "There are no fiscal implications for the State of Hawaii after the initial six-year period. The measure does not establish any state-funded programs or create ongoing financial obligations for the government. Any costs related to compliance are the responsibility of private condominium associations.",
