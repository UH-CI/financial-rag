  "overview": "This bill seeks to enforce compliance with existing condominium laws that mandate detailed budget summaries and replacement reserve studies. It removes the 'good faith' legal defense for condominium association boards that fail to include the required budget summary in their adopted budget. The measure also explicitly grants unit owners legal standing to sue for non-compliance and places the burden of proof on the association to demonstrate its adherence to the law.",
  "appropriations": "This measure does not appropriate any funds. It is a regulatory bill focused on legal compliance and enforcement within private condominium associations. Therefore, there are no specified fiscal years, amounts, or intended uses for state funds.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "This bill has no direct fiscal impact on the State of Hawaii, as it does not require any expenditure of state funds. Consequently, no financial projections, cost estimation methods, or data sources were used in this analysis. The bill's effects are limited to legal procedures and liabilities concerning private condominium associations and their owners.",
  "agency_impact": "This measure is not anticipated to have any operational, administrative, or budgetary impact on any government agency. The bill clarifies a private right of action for condominium owners to enforce compliance through the court system. It does not impose any new duties or responsibilities on state departments or commissions.",
  "economic_impact": "This bill is not expected to have a direct economic impact on the State of Hawaii's finances. However, it may provide an indirect economic benefit to condominium owners by promoting greater financial transparency and accountability from their association boards. Enforcing compliance with reserve study requirements could help prevent fiscal mismanagement and reduce the likelihood of large, unexpected special assessments on unit owners.",
  "policy_impact": "This measure amends existing condominium law, specifically Hawaii Revised Statutes ยง514B-148, to strengthen the enforcement of financial disclosure requirements. It aligns with a broader legislative strategy to increase transparency and accountability within condominium associations, building upon recent acts. The bill shifts the burden of proof to the association in legal disputes and empowers unit owners with a clearer path to seek enforcement in court.",
  "revenue_sources": "This bill does not identify, create, or authorize any sources of revenue. Its purpose is to amend statutory language related to legal compliance and enforcement for condominium associations. No general funds, grants, fees, or other revenue streams are associated with this measure.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "This measure is expected to have no fiscal implications for the State of Hawaii over the next six years. The bill does not authorize any new positions or require expenditures for equipment, facilities, or other operating costs. Since it only pertains to the legal relationship between condominium owners and their associations, it does not create any financial obligations for the state. It makes no changes to state revenues or expenditures. Therefore, no recurring expenses or program expansions involving state funds are projected.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "There is no anticipated impact on state operating revenues as a result of this measure. The bill does not introduce any new taxes, fees, fines payable to the state, or other mechanisms that would alter state revenue streams. Its focus is solely on compliance and enforcement within private entities.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "This measure does not require or authorize any capital expenditures by the State. There are no provisions for investments in facilities, equipment, or technology infrastructure. All compliance costs would be borne by the private condominium associations.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "There are no ongoing fiscal obligations for the state after the initial six-year period resulting from this bill. As the measure has no cost impact, there are no annual operating costs or program sites to sustain with state funds. The bill's provisions are purely regulatory and do not involve the state budget.",
