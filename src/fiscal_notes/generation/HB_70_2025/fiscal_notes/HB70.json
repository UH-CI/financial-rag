  "overview": "The purpose of this Act is to emphasize the importance of compliance with the requirements enacted by Acts 62 and 199 by specifying that the budget summary must contain all required information without referring the reader to other portions of the budget, and clarifying a unit owner's ability to enforce compliance with budget summary and replacement reserves requirements (HB70). The legislature finds that condominium unit owners are entitled to disclosure of information about the replacement reserves maintained by the condominium association in which they own a unit (HB70). This Act requires budget summaries to contain all required information and clarifies a unit owner's ability to enforce compliance (HB70).",
  "appropriations": "This measure does not contain any appropriations.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "This measure has no financial impact on the State of Hawaii. Therefore, no assumptions or methodology are necessary to calculate financial projections.",
  "agency_impact": "This measure is not anticipated to have any operational, administrative, or budgetary impact on any government agency or department. The bill clarifies that enforcement of compliance is through legal action brought by a unit owner against their association, stating, \"Any unit owner shall have standing to bring an action alleging a violation of this section against an association that the unit owner is a member of\" (HB70).",
  "economic_impact": "The economic impact of this measure is primarily on private condominium associations and their owners, not on the state. The Act is intended to \"better inform owners of the financial condition of an association\" (HB70). By increasing transparency and accountability regarding replacement reserves, the measure may lead to better-funded reserves and more stable financial conditions for condominium associations.",
  "policy_impact": "This Act amends Section 514B-148, Hawaii Revised Statutes, to build upon recent efforts to increase transparency, such as Act 62, Session Laws of Hawaii 2022, and Act 199, Session Laws of Hawaii 2023 (HB70). The measure modifies existing law by specifying that a \"budget summary shall contain all required information without referring the reader to other portions of the budget\" (HB70). It also clarifies policy by explicitly granting any unit owner standing to bring an action to enforce compliance with budget summary and replacement reserves requirements (HB70).",
  "revenue_sources": "This measure does not identify or create any revenue sources for the State of Hawaii.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "This measure is not expected to have any fiscal implications for the State of Hawaii over the next six years. The bill's requirements apply to private condominium associations and do not impose any costs or responsibilities on state or county governments. The enforcement mechanism established by the bill relies on private action by unit owners, as it states, \"Any unit owner shall have standing to bring an action alleging a violation of this section against an association that the unit owner is a member of, and may seek an injunction to enforce compliance with this section by the association's board\" (HB70). Therefore, no state funds are required for implementation or oversight. There are no projected costs, staffing changes, or recurring expenses for any state agency resulting from this Act.",
