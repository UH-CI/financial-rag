There are no substantive changes to the fiscal assessment, as the bill continues to have no direct financial impact on the State of Hawaii. The previous note's update referencing a later version of the bill (HB70 HD1 SD1) and a different effective date is not relevant to the current documents provided for HB70 HD1."
