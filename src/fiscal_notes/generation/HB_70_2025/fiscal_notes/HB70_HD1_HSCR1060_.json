  "overview": "Your Committee finds that condominium associations in the State play a critical role in managing shared residential properties, yet concerns have arisen regarding the transparency and accountability of financial disclosures, particularly with reserve studies and budget summaries. [6] Your Committee further finds that some condominium associations have failed to provide clear and accessible summaries of their financial health, leaving unit owners without crucial information about their financial obligations and long-term property maintenance. [6] This measure strengthens financial transparency by ensuring that condominium associations provide accurate and complete budget summaries and removes the good faith exemption for boards that fail to comply, promoting better governance and protecting homeowners' interest.

  "policy_impact": "The measure's proposed changes have drawn opposition, with testimony suggesting the language “The defense of good faith shall be unavailable to an association whenever its board adopts a budget that omits the summary required by subsection (a)” may cause disputes and litigation. [5] Opponents also argue that placing the burden of proof on the association is inconsistent with general principles of law to allow an owner to file an action without any burden of proof. [5] Supporters believe the best solution is to force boards and managing agent to comply with the intent of Act 199 by taking away their good faith exemption if they do not comply. [5]",
