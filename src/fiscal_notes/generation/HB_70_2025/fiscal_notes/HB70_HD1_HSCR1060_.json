  "overview": "The purpose of this measure is to: (1) Specify that the condominium association budget summary must contain all required information without referring the reader to other portions of the budget; (2) Explicitly state that the defense of good faith compliance is unavailable to any condominium association whose board adopts a budget that omits the required budget summary; and (3) Provide that a condominium association has the burden of proving compliance (HB70_HD1_HSCR1060_).",

  "economic_impact": "Testimony from a unit owner indicates paying \"about $15,000 (HB70_HD1_TESTIMONY_JHA_02-25-25_.PDF.txt) in yearly fees\" with a \"2025 Reserve deficit per unit is $14,783 (HB70_HD1_TESTIMONY_JHA_02-25-25_.PDF.txt).\" Further testimony mentions a potential \"landscape contract reduction of up to $80,000 (HB70_HD1_TESTIMONY_JHA_02-25-25_.PDF.txt)\" and a construction defect settlement with \"monthly interest about $14,000 (HB70_HD1_TESTIMONY_JHA_02-25-25_.PDF.txt) per month.\" Opponents of the measure argue it \"may expose associations to costly frivolous litigation over whether they complied with Section 514B-148(a)\" (HB70_HD1_TESTIMONY_JHA_02-25-25_.PDF.txt).",
  "policy_impact": "This measure strengthens financial transparency by ensuring that condominium associations provide accurate and complete budget summaries and removes the good faith exemption for boards that fail to comply, promoting better governance and protecting homeowners' interest (HB70_HD1_HSCR1060_). Opponents argue that shifting the burden of proof to an association is \"inconsistent with general principles of law to allow an owner to file an action without any burden of proof\" (HB70_HD1_TESTIMONY_JHA_02-25-25_.PDF.txt). The Committee on Judiciary & Hawaiian Affairs finds that some associations have failed to provide clear summaries, leaving owners without crucial information, and recommends that the measure pass Third Reading (HB70_HD1_HSCR1060_).",

  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The primary update is that the Committee on Judiciary & Hawaiian Affairs is now \"in accord with the intent and purpose of H.B. No. 70, H.D. 1, and recommends that it pass Third Reading\" (HB70_HD1_HSCR1060_). The committee report finds that \"some condominium associations have failed to provide clear and accessible summaries of their financial health, leaving unit owners without crucial information\" (HB70_HD1_HSCR1060_). Opposition testimony before this committee continues to argue the bill \"may expose associations to costly frivolous litigation\" (HB70_HD1_TESTIMONY_JHA_02-25-25_.PDF.txt) and proposes amending the language to apply only when a board \"adopts a budget that completely omits the summary\" (HB70_HD1_TESTIMONY_JHA_02-25-25_.PDF.txt). New testimony introduced additional financial context, including one owner paying \"about $15,000 (HB70_HD1_TESTIMONY_JHA_02-25-25_.PDF.txt) in yearly fees,\" a potential \"landscape contract reduction of up to $80,000 (HB70_HD1_TESTIMONY_JHA_02-25-25_.PDF.txt),\" and construction settlement interest of \"about $14,000 (HB70_HD1_TESTIMONY_JHA_02-25-25_.PDF.txt) per month,\" while reiterating the previously noted \"Reserve deficit per unit is $14,783 (HB70_HD1_TESTIMONY_JHA_02-25-25_.PDF.txt).\""
