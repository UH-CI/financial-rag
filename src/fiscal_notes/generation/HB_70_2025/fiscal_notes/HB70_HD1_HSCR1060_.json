  "economic_impact": "Testimony from opponents elaborates on the risk of litigation by proposing specific preventative language to mitigate potential negative economic impacts. They suggest amending the bill so that the 'good faith' defense is only unavailable when a board 'completely omits' the required summary, rather than for any error or omission. This change is intended to protect associations from costly legal disputes arising from inadvertent or minor errors, the costs of which would ultimately be passed on to all unit owners.",
  "policy_impact": "Testimony raises significant policy concerns, arguing that shifting the legal burden of proof to the association is inconsistent with general principles of law, which typically require the plaintiff to prove their case. Opponents believe this provision would encourage frivolous lawsuits against volunteer boards. Additionally, while the measure grants owners standing to sue, other testimony questions the practical ability of owners to afford legal action, suggesting the bill's intended enforcement may be limited without additional support mechanisms.",

It specifies the amendment language proposed by opponents ('completely omits') to mitigate litigation risks, a detail not present in the previous note. It also incorporates the legal policy argument that shifting the burden of proof contravenes established legal principles and introduces the concern raised in testimony regarding the financial barrier for unit owners seeking to enforce the measure."
