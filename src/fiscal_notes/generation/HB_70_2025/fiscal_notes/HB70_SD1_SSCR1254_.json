  "overview": "The measure has been significantly amended by the Senate Committee on Commerce and Consumer Protection, which removed the provision that would have made the defense of good faith compliance unavailable to condominium associations omitting the required budget summary (HB70_SD1_SSCR1254_). The bill, now designated as HB70 HD1 SD1, advances with its remaining provisions, which clarify enforcement of budget summary requirements and place the burden of proving compliance on the association. The measure has now been referred to the Senate Committee on Judiciary, where testimony reflects a narrowed focus on the legal implications of shifting the burden of proof (HB70_SD1).",

  "economic_impact": "New testimony highlights additional financial pressures on condominium owners, including an instance where a liability insurance premium increased to over $1,037,000 (HB70_HD1_TESTIMONY_CPN_03-14-25_) annually, leading to assessments exceeding $5,200 (HB70_HD1_TESTIMONY_CPN_03-14-25_) per unit. Another testifier cited a per-unit reserve fund deficit of $14,783 (HB70_HD1_TESTIMONY_CPN_03-14-25_). With the removal of the 'good faith' defense provision, opponents' concerns about litigation costs now center on the burden of proof requirement potentially encouraging lawsuits.",
  "policy_impact": "The most significant policy change is the amendment by the Senate Committee on Commerce and Consumer Protection to delete the language that would have barred the good faith defense (HB70_SD1_SSCR1254_). This action directly addressed a central point of contention from opponents in prior hearings. Consequently, the policy debate has shifted, with opposition now focused entirely on the remaining provision that requires the association to bear the burden of proving substantial compliance in any legal action, a point contested as being inconsistent with general principles of law (HB70_SD1).",

  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "This fiscal note reflects a major amendment to the bill by the Senate Committee on Commerce and Consumer Protection, which deleted the provision removing the 'good faith' defense for associations (HB70_SD1_SSCR1254_). The policy focus has consequently narrowed to the remaining burden of proof requirement. New financial data from testimony includes a condominium's annual insurance premium of over $1,037,000 (HB70_HD1_TESTIMONY_CPN_03-14-25_), subsequent owner assessments over $5,200 (HB70_HD1_TESTIMONY_CPN_03-14-25_), and a per-unit reserve deficit of $14,783 (HB70_HD1_TESTIMONY_CPN_03-14-25_)."
