  "overview": "The purpose of this Act is to emphasize the importance of compliance with the requirements enacted by Acts 62 and 199 by specifying that the budget summary must contain all required information without referring the reader to other portions of the budget and providing that an association has the burden of proving compliance. [8] [8] This measure aims to prevent associations from misleading consumers by omitting important financial information from their budget summaries. [9] To prevent unnecessary litigation, the measure was amended by removing language that would have barred the defense of good faith for any condominium association whose board adopts a budget that omits the budget summary.

[7] [7] Testimony in opposition continues to argue the statute may expose associations to costly frivolous litigation over whether they complied with Section 514B-148(a). [7]",
  "policy_impact": "Your Committee notes the concerns raised in testimony that an association could easily inadvertently omit information from the summary, or the information provided in the summary may later turn out to be inaccurate or incomplete. [9] If a specific component is inadvertently omitted from the summary and the omission is not disclosed, an association could be accused of breaching its duty by failing to meet all the budget summary requirements, even if the association acted in good faith. [9] Accordingly, your Committee has amended this measure by removing language that would have barred the defense of good faith for any condominium association whose board adopts a budget that omits the budget summary required by section 514B-148(a), Hawaii Revised Statutes.
