  "overview": "The purpose of this measure is to specify that a condominium association's budget summary shall have all required information without referring the reader to other portions of the budget and to clarify the ability to enforce compliance with the budget summary and replacement reserves requirements by providing that an association has the burden of proving compliance (HB70_SD1_SSCR1254_). This version of the bill has been amended to remove language that would have made the defense of good faith unavailable to an association whose board adopts a budget that omits the required budget summary (HB70_SD1_SSCR1254_). The bill is now designated as H.B. No. 70, H.D. 1, S.D. 1, and has been referred to the Committee on Judiciary (HB70_SD1_SSCR1254_).",

Another individual testified to paying approximately $15,000 (HB70_HD1_TESTIMONY_CPN_03-14-25_.PDF.txt) in yearly fees. One owner reported reserve fees doubled with a deficit of $14,783 (HB70_HD1_TESTIMONY_CPN_03-14-25_.PDF.txt) per unit.",
  "policy_impact": "The Committee on Commerce and Consumer Protection has amended this measure by \"Removing language that would have barred the defense of good faith for any condominium association whose board adopts a budget that omits the budget summary required by section 514B-148(a), Hawaii Revised Statutes\" (HB70_SD1_SSCR1254_). This change was made to \"prevent unnecessary litigation or disputes\" because \"an association could easily inadvertently omit information from the summary... even if the association acted in good faith\" (HB70_SD1_SSCR1254_). As a result, opposition testimony now focuses on the remaining provision that \"shifts the burden of proof to the association,\" arguing it is \"inconsistent with general principles of law\" (HB70_SD1).",

  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The most significant update is a major amendment by the Committee on Commerce and Consumer Protection, which removed the provision making the \"defense of good faith compliance\" unavailable to associations that omit a budget summary (HB70_SD1_SSCR1254_). The committee made this change due to concerns that \"an association could easily inadvertently omit information from the summary... even if the association acted in good faith\" and to \"prevent unnecessary litigation\" (HB70_SD1_SSCR1254_). Consequently, opposition testimony has shifted to focus on deleting the provision that places the \"burden of proving substantial compliance\" on the association, which opponents argue is \"inconsistent with general principles of law to shift the burden of proof entirely to the defendant\" (HB70_SD1). New economic testimony details one condominium's liability insurance premium rising to over $1,037,000 (HB70_HD1_TESTIMONY_CPN_03-14-25_.PDF.txt) annually, leading to owner assessment fees \"exceeding $5,200 (HB70_HD1_TESTIMONY_CPN_03-14-25_.PDF.txt).\" Testimony also reiterated previously mentioned figures from a new source, including a deficit of $14,783 (HB70_HD1_TESTIMONY_CPN_03-14-25_.PDF.txt) per unit and yearly fees of approximately $15,000 (HB70_HD1_TESTIMONY_CPN_03-14-25_.PDF.txt). Procedurally, the bill passed Second Reading as H.B. No. 70, H.D. 1, S.D. 1 and was referred to the Committee on Judiciary (HB70_SD1_SSCR1254_)."
