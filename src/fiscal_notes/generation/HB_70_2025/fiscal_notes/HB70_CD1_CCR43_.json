  "overview": "The purpose of this Act is to emphasize the importance of compliance with the requirements enacted by Acts 62 and 199. [12] This is achieved by specifying that the budget summary must contain all required information without referring the reader to other portions of the budget and clarifying a unit owner's ability to enforce compliance with budget summary and replacement reserves requirements. [12] The measure provides that any unit owner shall have standing to bring an action alleging a violation of this section against an association and may seek an injunction to enforce compliance by the association's board.

[13] The previous fiscal note highlighted opposition to this burden-shifting provision. [12] The Committee on Conference amended the measure by removing this language and changing the effective date to upon approval. [13]"
