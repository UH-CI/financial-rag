  "overview": "The purpose of this Act is to emphasize the importance of compliance with the requirements enacted by Acts 62 and 199 by: (1) Specifying that the budget summary must contain all required information without referring the reader to other portions of the budget; and (2) Clarifying a unit owner's ability to enforce compliance with budget summary and replacement reserves requirements (HB70_CD1). The measure clarifies a condominium unit owner's capacity to enforce compliance with the budget summary and replacement reserves requirements (HB70_CD1_CCR43_). This Act shall take effect upon its approval (HB70_CD1).",

  "policy_impact": "A key policy change involves the removal of a provision shifting the burden of proof to associations. The Conference Committee has amended this measure by 'Deleting language providing that the condominium association has the burden to prove substantial compliance with budget summary and replacement reserves requirements' (HB70_CD1_CCR43_). Accordingly, the bill removes the language specifying that an association 'shall have the burden of proving it has complied with this section' in any enforcement proceeding (HB70_CD1). The bill now states that 'Any unit owner shall have standing to bring an action alleging a violation of this section against an association that the unit owner is a member of, and may seek an injunction to enforce compliance with this section by the association's board' (HB70_CD1).",

  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The primary update from the previous fiscal note is the resolution of the contentious 'burden of proof' issue. The Conference Committee amended the measure by 'Deleting language providing that the condominium association has the burden to prove substantial compliance with budget summary and replacement reserves requirements' (HB70_CD1_CCR43_). This change directly addresses the opposition highlighted in the prior note, which argued that shifting the burden of proof was inconsistent with general legal principles. Additionally, the committee report notes 'Changing the effective date to upon approval' (HB70_CD1_CCR43_)."
