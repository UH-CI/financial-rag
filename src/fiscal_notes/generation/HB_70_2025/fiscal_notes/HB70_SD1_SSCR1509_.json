  "economic_impact": "The economic debate has sharpened around the potential for increased litigation costs, as opponents testified that shifting the burden of proof will expose associations to \"costly frivolous litigation\" (HB70_SD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-25-25_). Testimony further suggests this could cause insurance carriers to raise premiums or deny coverage, placing additional financial strain on unit owners (HB70_SD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-25-25_).",
  "policy_impact": "The bill's key policy, shifting the burden of proof to the association, was affirmed by the Senate Committee on Judiciary's decision to pass the measure without amendment (HB70_SD1_SSCR1509_). Testimony before the committee solidified this as the central point of contention, with opponents arguing it is \"inconsistent with general principles of law\" for a plaintiff to not bear the initial burden of proof (HB70_SD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-25-25_). The committeeâ€™s advancement of the bill signals legislative support for creating this specific legal standard for condominium association compliance enforcement.",

The policy debate has solidified around the controversial burden-of-proof provision, which opponents consistently testified is contrary to standard legal principles (HB70_SD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-25-25_). New economic arguments focus on the risk that this provision could encourage frivolous litigation, potentially leading to increased insurance premiums for associations (HB70_SD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-25-25_)."
