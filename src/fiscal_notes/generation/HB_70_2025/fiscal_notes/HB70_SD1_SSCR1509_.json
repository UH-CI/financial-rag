  "overview": "The purpose and intent of this measure is to require budget summaries to contain all required information without referring the reader to other portions of the budget. [11] It also clarifies the ability to enforce compliance with budget summary and replacement reserves requirements and provides that an association has the burden of proving compliance. [11] This measure will further enhance transparency and provide both owners and prospective purchasers with valuable insights into the association's financial health by requiring these budget summaries to contain all required information.

[CHUNK_45, NUMBER_0] Another individual referenced a lawsuit with a landmark $1.80 (HB70_SD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-25-25_.PDF.txt) Million Award for Deception and Negligence to support the bill. [CHUNK_46, NUMBER_1] Opposing testimony argues the statute may expose associations to costly frivolous litigation, and notes that when associations are sued, their insurance carriers raise premiums, or worse, no longer offer coverage.

  "policy_impact": "The primary point of opposition in testimony is the provision that shifts the burden of proof to the association. [10] Numerous individuals and associations state that this provision is inconsistent with general principles of law and should be deleted. [10] Opponents argue that a party who brings an action should have the burden of proof, and an owner should be required to put forth evidence of the violation. [10] [10]",

[10] New testimony from the Palehua Townhouse Association, Honolulu Tower Association of Apartment Owners, and eleven individuals is in opposition, primarily arguing that shifting the burden of proof is inconsistent with general principles of law.
