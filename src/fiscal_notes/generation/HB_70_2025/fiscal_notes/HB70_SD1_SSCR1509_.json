  "overview": "This measure, HB70 HD1 SD1, amends condominium law to require that mandatory budget summaries contain all required information without reference to other documents. It clarifies that any unit owner has standing to bring an action to enforce compliance with budget summary and reserve study requirements. The bill also places the burden of proving substantial compliance on the condominium association in any such legal action.",
  "appropriations": "This measure does not require an appropriation of state funds. All potential costs are related to legal actions between private parties, specifically condominium owners and their associations. No state resources are allocated for implementation or enforcement.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "This fiscal note is based on the understanding that the bill does not create any new state programs or impose new duties on any state agency. The financial impact is indeterminate and would fall upon private condominium associations and their members through potential litigation. No cost estimation methods are applicable as there are no direct state expenditures or revenues.",
  "agency_impact": "There is no anticipated operational, administrative, or budgetary impact on any state agency. The bill's enforcement mechanism relies on civil litigation initiated by condominium unit owners against their associations. No state agency is tasked with oversight, supervision, or enforcement of these provisions.",
  "economic_impact": "The measure is expected to enhance financial transparency for condominium owners and prospective buyers, potentially preventing unexpected special assessments by ensuring better disclosure of an association's financial health. However, opponents express concern that shifting the burden of proof to associations could encourage frivolous lawsuits, leading to increased legal expenses and higher insurance premiums. These costs would ultimately be passed on to all unit owners through maintenance fees.",
  "policy_impact": "This measure amends Hawaii Revised Statutes ยง514B-148, building upon the requirements of Act 199, Session Laws of Hawaii 2023, which mandated a detailed budget summary. The key policy shifts are establishing a clear standing for unit owners to sue for compliance and placing the legal burden of proving compliance on the association. This change aims to strengthen enforcement of financial disclosure laws within self-governed condominium associations.",
  "revenue_sources": "This measure does not create, modify, or affect any source of revenue for the State of Hawaii. It pertains to the internal financial governance of private condominium associations. Therefore, no state funds are involved.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "This bill has no fiscal implications for the State of Hawaii over the next six years or any other period. It does not require any state expenditures or generate any state revenue. The effective date of July 1, 3000, indicates that the bill's substance may be intended for further discussion or inclusion in other legislation, but in its current form, it does not commit state funds. All potential financial impacts are confined to private litigation between condominium owners and their associations, which could involve legal fees and potential increases in association insurance premiums. These costs are variable, indeterminate, and do not affect the state budget. No state staffing, resources, or capital will be required for implementation.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "There is no anticipated impact on the operating revenues of the State of Hawaii. The measure does not introduce any fees, fines, or other revenue-generating mechanisms payable to the state. It solely addresses compliance and enforcement within private condominium associations.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "This measure does not require any capital expenditures by the State of Hawaii. No state facilities, equipment, or technology infrastructure are needed to support the bill's provisions. All requirements pertain to the actions of private condominium associations.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "There are no fiscal implications for the State of Hawaii after the six-year period. The measure does not create any ongoing state programs or financial obligations. Any long-term financial effects will be borne by private condominium associations and their members.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The primary change from the previous version of the bill (HB70 HD1) to the current version (HB70 HD1 SD1) is the removal of a key provision that made the defense of good faith unavailable to a condominium association whose board adopts a budget that omits the required summary. Testimony on the earlier version of the bill strongly opposed this clause, arguing it would lead to excessive litigation over minor, inadvertent omissions. The current bill retains the provisions that clarify a unit owner's standing to sue for compliance and shift the burden of proving substantial compliance to the association, but the controversial 'good faith' defense removal has been deleted."
