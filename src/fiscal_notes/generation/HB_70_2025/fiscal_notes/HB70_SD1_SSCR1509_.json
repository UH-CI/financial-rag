  "overview": "The purpose and intent of this measure is to require budget summaries to contain all required information without referring the reader to other portions of the budget and to clarify the ability to enforce compliance with budget summary and replacement reserves requirements by providing that an association has the burden of proving compliance (HB70_SD1_SSCR1509_). The Committee on Judiciary received testimony in support of this measure from five individuals and in opposition from eleven individuals (HB70_SD1_SSCR1509_). The committee is in accord with the intent and purpose of H.B. No. 70, H.D. 1, S.D. 1, and recommends that it pass Third Reading (HB70_SD1_SSCR1509_).",

  "economic_impact": "Testimony submitted to the Judiciary Committee reiterated concerns about the financial consequences of inadequate reserve studies, with one individual reporting their 'reserve fees doubled' creating a 'deficit of $14,783.00 (HB70_SD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-25-25_.PDF.txt) per unit' (HB70_SD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-25-25_). This testimony specified that the association's reserve studies 'had not been conducted for 8 years' (HB70_SD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-25-25_). Another supporting testimony referenced a figure of $1.80 (HB70_SD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-25-25_.PDF.txt) in the context of a landmark lawsuit for 'Deception and Negligence' (HB70_SD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-25-25_).",
  "policy_impact": "The policy debate remains focused on the provision that gives unit owners standing to bring an action and states 'The association shall have the burden of proving substantial compliance with this section in any such action' (HB70_SD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-25-25_). Testimony from multiple individuals and organizations in opposition states that 'The last sentence which shifts the burden of proof to the association should be deleted' (HB70_SD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-25-25_). This opposition is based on the argument that 'It is inconsistent with general principles of law to shift the burden of proof entirely to the defendant' (HB70_SD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-25-25_).",

  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The primary update is procedural: the Senate Committee on Judiciary has reviewed the bill and 'recommends that it pass Third Reading' (HB70_SD1_SSCR1509_). The committee received new testimony, with support from organizations like the Hawai ªi Association of REALTORS and opposition from groups including the Honolulu Tower Association of Apartment Owners and eleven individuals (HB70_SD1_SSCR1509_). The policy debate has solidified around the 'burden of proof' clause, with numerous opposition testimonies arguing that the sentence which 'shifts the burden of proof to the association should be deleted' as it is 'inconsistent with general principles of law' (HB70_SD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-25-25_). New testimony reiterated a previously cited economic impact of a 'deficit of $14,783.00 (HB70_SD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-25-25_.PDF.txt) per unit' from inadequate reserve funding (HB70_SD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-25-25_)."
