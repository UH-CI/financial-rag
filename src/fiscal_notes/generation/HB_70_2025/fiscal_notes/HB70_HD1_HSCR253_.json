  "overview": "House Bill 70, HD1 amends condominium law to improve compliance with financial disclosure requirements established in recent years. This measure specifies that required budget summaries must contain all necessary information without referring to other documents. It further provides that the defense of good faith is unavailable to an association whose board adopts a budget omitting this summary and places the burden of proving substantial compliance on the association in an enforcement action.",
  "appropriations": "This measure does not contain any appropriation of state funds. The bill's enforcement mechanism is a private right of action for unit owners against their condominium association. No state agency is tasked with implementation, and therefore no funding is allocated for personnel, training, or operational costs.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "This fiscal analysis assumes the measure has no direct financial impact on the State of Hawaii, as it does not involve state expenditures or revenues. The assessment is based on legislative documents and testimony, which indicate that the bill regulates the internal governance and legal processes of private entities. Consequently, no quantitative cost estimation methodology was required.",
  "agency_impact": "No significant operational or budgetary impact on any state agency is anticipated. The measure does not assign new regulatory or enforcement responsibilities to the state. The Judiciary may see a negligible increase in its civil caseload due to potential lawsuits between unit owners and associations, but this is not expected to require additional resources.",
  "economic_impact": "The economic effects of this measure are expected to be confined to private condominium associations and their owners. Supporters believe it will increase financial transparency and protect owners from mismanagement. However, extensive testimony from opponents suggests the bill could lead to a rise in frivolous litigation, which would increase legal and insurance costs for associations that are ultimately paid by all unit owners through higher fees.",
  "policy_impact": "This bill amends Hawaii Revised Statutes Section 514B-148 to strengthen the enforcement of financial transparency laws, specifically targeting the budget summary requirements. It alters the legal landscape for condominium disputes by removing the good faith defense for non-compliance with the summary requirement. The most significant policy shift is reversing the burden of proof in these specific civil actions, requiring the defendant association to prove its compliance.",
  "revenue_sources": "This measure does not create or identify any revenue sources for the State of Hawaii. It does not authorize any state agency to collect fees, fines, or taxes related to its provisions. Any financial costs or penalties associated with the measure are borne by the private parties involved in litigation.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "There are no direct fiscal implications for the State of Hawaii over the next six years. The bill does not mandate any state expenditures, create new programs, or require additional state personnel. Its focus on private association governance means that all associated costs, such as those for legal defense or increased insurance premiums as cited in testimony, fall on the private associations and their members. The state's six-year financial plan is unaffected, as there are no projected changes to state revenues or expenditures. The measure does not involve the use of state funds or resources.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "This bill is not expected to have any impact on the operating revenues of the State of Hawaii. No new fees, fines, or other income streams for the state are generated by this measure. Its provisions are limited to the financial disclosure and legal liabilities of private condominium associations.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "This measure does not require any capital expenditures by the State of Hawaii. The implementation of its provisions does not necessitate any investment in state facilities, equipment, or technology. All requirements pertain to the administrative and legal conduct of private associations.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "As the measure carries no fiscal implications for the state within the six-year planning period, there are no ongoing state fiscal obligations anticipated thereafter. The bill does not establish any state-funded program or create long-term liabilities for the state. The legal framework it establishes is designed to be enforced through private action without state financial involvement.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The previous fiscal note analyzed a later version of the bill, HB70 HD1 SD1. The current analysis is based on HB70 HD1, which includes a key amendment noted in House Standing Committee Report 253: the bill's effective date was changed to July 1, 3000. This change was made to encourage further discussion and is a notable difference from the likely finalized effective date in the SD1 version. Otherwise, the core fiscal conclusion that the bill has no direct financial impact on the state remains consistent with the previous note."
