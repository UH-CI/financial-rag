  "overview": "This measure has been amended to specify that the defense of good faith is unavailable to a condominium association that omits the required budget summary, and it places the burden of proving substantial compliance on the association in any enforcement action. The bill now also explicitly requires the budget summary to contain all required information without referring to other documents. The effective date has been changed to July 1, 3000, to encourage further discussion.",

  "agency_impact": "Testimony from multiple parties highlights a significant concern that removing the good faith defense and shifting the burden of proof could lead to an increase in litigation against condominium associations. This may result in a greater-than-previously-anticipated caseload for the Judiciary, though any associated costs are still expected to be absorbed within existing resources. The debate centers on whether such lawsuits would be for legitimate enforcement or would constitute frivolous litigation.",
  "economic_impact": "The potential economic effects are more pronounced, with opponents forecasting increased operational costs for associations due to litigation expenses and potentially higher insurance premiums. Conversely, supporters argue the measure will protect unit owners from significant financial losses stemming from mismanagement and improperly funded reserves, as evidenced by testimony of exorbitant increases in insurance and special assessments. This bill could shift legal and financial risks from individual owners to association boards to compel compliance.",
  "policy_impact": "This measure strengthens enforcement by altering legal incentives, specifically by removing the good faith defense for non-compliance and shifting the burden of proof to the association. This represents a significant policy decision to make non-compliance more legally and financially risky for association boards, thereby compelling adherence to financial transparency laws. This is a more direct enforcement mechanism than simply granting standing for owners to initiate legal action.",

  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The primary updates to this measure involve the addition of specific legal enforcement mechanisms and heightened concerns about their impact. Key changes include: the removal of the 'good faith' defense for associations omitting the required budget summary; the explicit placement of the burden of proof for compliance on the association; and a new requirement for the budget summary to be a self-contained document. Consequently, testimony now heavily focuses on the potential for increased litigation, which raises the projected economic impact on associations through legal costs while also offering greater financial protection to unit owners against mismanagement."
