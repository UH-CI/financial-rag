  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The House Committee on Consumer Protection & Commerce amended this measure by '[s]pecifying that budget summaries must contain all required information without referring the reader to other portions of the budget' and '[c]hanging the effective date to July 1, 3000, to encourage further discussion' (HB70_HD1_HSCR253_). Testimony on the amended bill, HB70 HD1, highlights ongoing debate. Supporters state that HB 70 HD1 'will protect consumers by excluding the defense of good faith for an association if its board adopts a budget that omits the required detailed budget summary' (HB70_HD1). Opponents argue that removing the 'defense of good faith' and shifting the burden of proof to the association 'may expose associations to costly frivolous litigation' (HB70_HD1) and is 'inconsistent with general principles of law' (HB70_HD1). Testimony from individuals illustrates the private financial context, citing a condominium's liability insurance premium 'rising to over $1,037,000 annually (HB70_HD1)', resulting owner assessments 'exceeding $5,200 in some cases (HB70_HD1)', and a separate instance of a reserve fund 'deficit of $14,783 per unit (HB70_HD1)'. The previous conclusion of no direct fiscal impact to the State of Hawaii remains unchanged."
