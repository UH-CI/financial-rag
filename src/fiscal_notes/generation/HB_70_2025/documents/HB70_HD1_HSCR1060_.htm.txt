RE:
H.B. No. 70
H.D.
1
Honorable Nadine K. Nakamura
Speaker, House of Representatives
Thirty-Third State Legislature
Regular Session of 2025
State of Hawaii
Madame:
Your Committee on Judiciary
& Hawaiian Affairs, to which was referred H.B. No. 70, H.D. 1, entitled:
"A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO CONDOMINIUM,"
begs leave to report as follows:
The
purpose of this measure is to:
(1)
Specify that the
condominium association budget summary must contain all required information
without referring the reader to other portions of the budget;
(2)
Explicitly state that
the defense of good faith compliance is unavailable to any condominium
association whose board adopts a budget that omits the required budget summary;
and
(3)
Provide that a
condominium association has the burden of proving compliance.
Your Committee received testimony in support of this measure
from the Hawaii Legislative Action Committee of the Community Associations
Institute; Hawaii First Realty LLC; and four individuals.
Your Committee received testimony in
opposition to this measure from Honolulu Tower; Palehua Townhouse Association;
and numerous individuals.
Your Committee
received comments on this measure from one individual.
Your Committee finds that condominium associations in the State
play a critical role in managing shared residential properties, yet concerns
have arisen regarding the transparency and accountability of financial
disclosures, particularly with reserve studies and budget summaries.
Your Committee further finds that some
condominium associations have failed to provide clear and accessible summaries
of their financial health, leaving unit owners without crucial information
about their financial obligations and long-term property maintenance.
This measure strengthens financial
transparency by ensuring that condominium associations provide accurate and
complete budget summaries and removes the good faith exemption for boards that
fail to comply, promoting better governance and protecting homeowners'
interest.
As affirmed by the
record of votes of the members of your Committee on Judiciary & Hawaiian
Affairs that is attached to this report, your Committee is in accord with the
intent and purpose of H.B. No. 70, H.D. 1, and recommends that it pass Third
Reading.
Respectfully
submitted on behalf of the members of the Committee on Judiciary & Hawaiian
Affairs,
