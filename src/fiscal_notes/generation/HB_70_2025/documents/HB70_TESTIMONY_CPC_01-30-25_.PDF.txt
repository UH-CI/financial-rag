HB70 Support with Amendment 
 
Dear Committee, 
 
My name is Richard Emery and a thirty-year condominium industry veteran.  I am a CAI 
Reserve Specialist (RS), reviewed or performed hundreds of Hawaii condominium reserve 
studies, participated on CAI’s national task force for reserve study public policy, and 
currently serve as an expert in numerous disputes or litigation related to condominium 
budget and reserve studies. 
 
Let’s remember that the national definition is of a reserve study – A budgeting tool not 
based on any professional review.  It is simply a planning document to give an association a 
best chance to accumulate reserve funds as building components come due and need 
repair or replacement.   The underlying data can change every year as components age. 
 
I would be the first to admit that I have seen poor work product by some associations 
recognizing on the other hand many do a stellar job.  That being said, a properly prepared 
reserve study is invaluable to an association.  A reserve study can be hundreds of pages in 
length that the untrained eye will not understand its implications. 
 
As the condominium industry is broad it becomes difficult to set a mandatory standard.  In 
2023 the legislature passed Act 199 that was signed into law mandating a budget summary 
that brings to the forefront the true status of ther condominijum’s reserves.  It is my belief 
that the industry itself will be forced to correct itself if the information is clearly disclosed.  
Unfortunately some associations look to an easy way to comply and use the summary to 
vaguely refer back to the original document.  Disclosure is important. 
 
The best soliution is to force boards and managing agent to comply with the intent of Act 
199 by taking away their good faith protection if they do not comply.  Furthter the proposed 

Bill needs to be  amended to clarify that referal to another source document is  not 
permitted. 
 
I support CAI’s recommendation to add a sentence after HRS 514B (a) (8) as follows: 
 
“The summary shall contain all required information, without referring reader to other 
portions of the budget or reserve study.” 
 
I support HB 70.

Dear Representative Matayoshi, Chair, Representative Chun, Vice Chair, and Members of the 
Committee: 
  
I am providing comments on H.B. No. 70. I support the intent of H.B. No. 70 but am 
suggesting changes. 
  
First, I oppose the proposed sentence in Section 2, subsection 1 of the measure (amending 
subsection (d)): “The defense of good faith shall be unavailable to an association whenever its 
board adopts a budget that omits the summary required by subsection (a).” This sentence may 
cause disputes and litigation in the event that an association includes a summary with a budget as 
specified in HRS Section 514B-148(a), but an owner contends that the summary does not strictly 
comply with all of the requirements Section 514B-148(a). Section 514B-148(a) provides a 
comprehensive list of requirements for the summary: 
  
§514B-148 Association fiscal matters; budgets and replacement reserves. (a) The budget 
required under section 514B-144(a) shall include a summary with at least the following details: 
(1) The estimated revenues and operating expenses of the association; 
(2) Disclosure as to whether the budget has been prepared on a cash or accrual basis; 
(3) The estimated costs of fire safety equipment or installations that meet the requirements of a 
life safety evaluation required by the applicable county for any building located in a county with 
a population greater than five hundred thousand; provided that the reserve study may forecast a 
loan or special assessment to fund life safety components or installation; 
(4) The balance of the total replacement reserves fund of the association as of the date of the 
budget; 

(5) The estimated replacement reserves assessments that the association will require to maintain 
the property based on a reserve study performed by or on behalf of the association; provided that 
the reserve study, if not prepared by an independent reserve study preparer, shall be reviewed by 
an independent reserve study preparer not less than every three years; provided further that a 
managing agent with industry reserve study designations shall not be considered as having a 
conflict of interest for purposes of this paragraph; 
(6) A general explanation of how the estimated replacement reserves assessments are computed 
and detailing: 
(A) The identity, qualifications, and potential conflicts of interest of the person or entity 
performing the reserve study, update, or any review thereof; 
(B) Disclosure of any component of association property omitted from the reserve study and the 
basis for the omission; 
(C) Planned increases in the estimated replacement reserve assessments over the thirty-year plan; 
and 
(D) Whether the actual estimated replacement reserves assessments for the prior year as defined 
in the study was less than the assessments provided for in the reserve study, and, if so, by how 
much, and explaining the impact of the lesser assessments on future estimated replacement 
reserves assessments; 
(7) The amount the association must collect for the fiscal year to fund the estimated replacement 
reserves assessments; and 
(8) Information as to whether the amount the association must collect for the fiscal year to fund 
the estimated replacement reserves assessments was calculated using a per cent funded or cash 
flow plan. The method or plan shall not circumvent the estimated replacement reserves 
assessments amount determined by the reserve study pursuant to paragraph (5). 
  
Given the level of detail in the specifications contained in Section 514B-148(a), an Association 
can easily inadvertently omit information from the summary, or information in the summary may 
turn out to be inaccurate or incomplete. For example, Section 514B-148(a)(6)(B) requires the 
disclosure of any component of association property omitted from the reserve study and the basis 
for the omission. If a component is inadvertently omitted from the summary and the omission is 
not disclosed, an owner could argue that the association breached its duty to submit a summary 
meeting the requirements of Section 514B-148(a). 
  

To avoid potential problems and litigation, the second sentence of subsection (d) should read: 
“The defense of good faith shall be unavailable to an association whenever its board adopts a 
budget that completely omits the summary required by subsection (a).” 
  
Second, I oppose the proposed second sentence in Section 2, subsection 2 of the measure 
(amending subsection (g)): “The association shall have the burden of proving substantial 
compliance with this section in any such action.” This sentence should be deleted. When a 
plaintiff brings an action, that party has the burden of proof. In some instances, the burden of 
proof may shift to the defendant, for example, after the plaintiff makes a prima facie showing of 
certain facts. However, it is inconsistent with general principles of law to allow a plaintiff to file 
an action without any burden of proof. There is no justification for shifting the burden of proof to 
an association. If an owner brings an action, the owner should be required to prove that the 
association failed to meet the requirements of Section 514B-148(a). The statute may expose 
associations to costly frivolous litigation over whether they complied with Section 514B-148(a). 
  
Respectfully submitted, 
Mark McKellar

Dear Representative Matayoshi, Chair, Representative Chun, Vice Chair, and Members of the 
Committee: 
  
I am providing comments on H.B. No. 70. I support the intent of H.B. No. 70 but am 
suggesting changes. 
  
First, I oppose the proposed sentence in Section 2, subsection 1 of the measure (amending 
subsection (d)): “The defense of good faith shall be unavailable to an association whenever its 
board adopts a budget that omits the summary required by subsection (a).” This sentence may 
cause disputes and litigation in the event that an association includes a summary with a budget as 
specified in HRS Section 514B-148(a), but an owner contends that the summary does not strictly 
comply with all of the requirements Section 514B-148(a). Section 514B-148(a) provides a 
comprehensive list of requirements for the summary: 
  
§514B-148 Association fiscal matters; budgets and replacement reserves. (a) The budget 
required under section 514B-144(a) shall include a summary with at least the following details: 
(1) The estimated revenues and operating expenses of the association; 
(2) Disclosure as to whether the budget has been prepared on a cash or accrual basis; 
(3) The estimated costs of fire safety equipment or installations that meet the requirements of a 
life safety evaluation required by the applicable county for any building located in a county with 
a population greater than five hundred thousand; provided that the reserve study may forecast a 
loan or special assessment to fund life safety components or installation; 

(4) The balance of the total replacement reserves fund of the association as of the date of the 
budget; 
(5) The estimated replacement reserves assessments that the association will require to maintain 
the property based on a reserve study performed by or on behalf of the association; provided that 
the reserve study, if not prepared by an independent reserve study preparer, shall be reviewed by 
an independent reserve study preparer not less than every three years; provided further that a 
managing agent with industry reserve study designations shall not be considered as having a 
conflict of interest for purposes of this paragraph; 
(6) A general explanation of how the estimated replacement reserves assessments are computed 
and detailing: 
(A) The identity, qualifications, and potential conflicts of interest of the person or entity 
performing the reserve study, update, or any review thereof; 
(B) Disclosure of any component of association property omitted from the reserve study and the 
basis for the omission; 
(C) Planned increases in the estimated replacement reserve assessments over the thirty-year plan; 
and 
(D) Whether the actual estimated replacement reserves assessments for the prior year as defined 
in the study was less than the assessments provided for in the reserve study, and, if so, by how 
much, and explaining the impact of the lesser assessments on future estimated replacement 
reserves assessments; 
(7) The amount the association must collect for the fiscal year to fund the estimated replacement 
reserves assessments; and 
(8) Information as to whether the amount the association must collect for the fiscal year to fund 
the estimated replacement reserves assessments was calculated using a per cent funded or cash 
flow plan. The method or plan shall not circumvent the estimated replacement reserves 
assessments amount determined by the reserve study pursuant to paragraph (5). 
  
Given the level of detail in the specifications contained in Section 514B-148(a), an Association 
can easily inadvertently omit information from the summary, or information in the summary may 
turn out to be inaccurate or incomplete. For example, Section 514B-148(a)(6)(B) requires the 
disclosure of any component of association property omitted from the reserve study and the basis 
for the omission. If a component is inadvertently omitted from the summary and the omission is 
not disclosed, an owner could argue that the association breached its duty to submit a summary 
meeting the requirements of Section 514B-148(a). 
  

To avoid potential problems and litigation, the second sentence of subsection (d) should read: 
“The defense of good faith shall be unavailable to an association whenever its board adopts a 
budget that completely omits the summary required by subsection (a).” 
  
Second, I oppose the proposed second sentence in Section 2, subsection 2 of the measure 
(amending subsection (g)): “The association shall have the burden of proving substantial 
compliance with this section in any such action.” This sentence should be deleted. When a 
plaintiff brings an action, that party has the burden of proof. In some instances, the burden of 
proof may shift to the defendant, for example, after the plaintiff makes a prima facie showing of 
certain facts. However, it is inconsistent with general principles of law to allow a plaintiff to file 
an action without any burden of proof. There is no justification for shifting the burden of proof to 
an association. If an owner brings an action, the owner should be required to prove that the 
association failed to meet the requirements of Section 514B-148(a). The statute may expose 
associations to costly frivolous litigation over whether they complied with Section 514B-148(a).

TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF HB70 
 
For:  The Committee on Consumer Protection & Commerce (CPC) 
 
DATE: 
Thursday, January 30, 2025 
TIME: 
2:00 PM 
PLACE: VIA VIDEOCONFERENCE 
Conference Room 329 
State Capitol 
415 South Beretania Street 
 
 
From:  Gregory Misakian, as an individual. 
 
Aloha Chair Matayoshi, Vice Chair Chun, and members of the Committee, 
 
My name is Gregory Misakian and I have been advocating for the rights of 
condominium owners in Hawaii since 2021, when I realized how much misconduct 
and corruption there is within many condominium associations throughout 
Hawaii, in addition to misconduct and corruption within numerous large 
management companies that manage and oversee condominium associations. 
 
As many as 1/3 of the population of Hawaii lives in condominiums, including many 
legislators and their friends and families.  It has been shown with evidence to 
support, including many news stories and a great deal of testimony, that 
condominium owners are being subjected to abusive and predatory practices, 
often at the direction of the condominium association’s President and Board, with 
management company agents and association attorneys being willful participants.   
 
Simply said, no matter how many Acts that are enACTed, many Directors on 
condominium association boards simply don’t care and do whatever they want, 
which often includes not ACTing like adults, and ACTions that are contrary to the 
governing documents and State laws.  To break it down further for our esteemed 

2 
 
legislators … they ACT like children, but even this analogy is flawed because 
children ACTually ACT better. 
 
In another life before Hawaii, I did some ACTing work on an Investigation 
Discovery show called “I (Almost) Got Away with It.”  In Hawaii that show would 
have to be renamed to “I (Almost Always) Got Away with It” when speaking of 
misconduct and corruption at condominium associations. 
 
While the ACT analogy and pun might seem funny, there is nothing funny about 
how badly many condominium associations are being managed, and the 
misconduct and corruption that exits. 
 
While I support HB70 and its intentions, owners still have the burden to go to 
court for enforcement, which can be very costly.  The only real solution to address 
serious issues within condominium associations and their proper management, is 
to have enforcement of the laws that you enACT.   (And yes, it’s hard to let this go 
once I started the theme).   
 
Please support HB890 and SB1265 (companion bill) for an Ombudsman’s Office 
for Condominium Associations. 
 
HB890 - RELATING TO CONDOMINIUM ASSOCIATIONS. (Ombudsman) 
SB1265 - RELATING TO CONDOMINIUM ASSOCIATIONS. (Ombudsman) 
 
And also: 
 
HB1209 - RELATING TO CONDOMINIUM ASSOCIATIONS. (Attorneys’ Fees) 
HB1311 - RELATING TO CONDOMINIUM PROXY VOTING. 
HB1312 - RELATING TO ASSOCIATION MANAGERS. 
HB1313 - RELATING TO BOARD MEMBERS. 
HB1315 - RELATING TO PARLIAMENTARIANS. 
 
I respectfully ask that all of these very important and well thought out 
condominium consumer protection bills be scheduled urgently for hearings.  
 

3 
 
For those who don’t know me, I currently serve as the 1st Vice President of the 
Kokua Council and was President for most of 2024.  The Kokua Council advocates 
for our kupuna and lesser advantaged.  I also serve on the Waikiki Neighborhood 
Board, where we have advocated for better consumer protections for 
condominium owners in a resolution adopted in 2023 (also adopted by other 
Neighborhood Boards). 
 
The people of Hawaii are counting on you to ACT, and I respectfully ask all on the 
committee and all legislators to please support HB70 and the other bills listed.   
 
Mahalo, 
 
Gregory Misakian

Comments:  
Dear Representative Matayoshi, Chair, Representative Chun, Vice Chair, and Members of the 
Committee: 
  
I OPPOSE H.B. No. 106 for the reasons set forth below. 
  
H.B. No. 106 adds a new provision on fines and appeals from fines. It establishes procedures to 
be followed by associations and time periods for action. While procedures and time periods serve 
a good purpose, this provision may conflict with the procedures and time periods for action 
found in the governing instruments of condominium associations. This will likely create 
confusion. A provision needs to be added addressing how those conflicts are to be resolved. 
  
The new HRS Section 514B-___(d) provides that a unit owner or tenant aggrieved by the 
decision of the board on an appeal from a fine may file an appeal in the small claims division of 
the district court in which the condominium is located. While the small claims court may decide 
legal issues related to fines, it is not a function of the small claims court to preside over appeals 
of fines. 
  
1. bill provides that if a fine is not enforceable or collectible, the association may not charge 
the owner or tenant for any attorneys’ fees incurred by the association related to the fine. 
This is vague and ambiguous and may be construed as prohibiting an association from 
recovering attorneys’ fees incurred by it in having its lawyer send a demand letter to an 
owner who has violated a covenant if a fine resulting from the violation is later waived, 
rescinded, or set aside. The fact that a fine has been waived, rescinded, or set aside does 
not necessarily mean that there was no violation warranting the sending of a demand 
letter. It may be that the board agreed to waive or rescind the fine as a gesture of goodwill 
or that the fine was set aside for technical reasons. Furthermore, a board may be less 

inclined to waive fines upon appeal if doing so means that it must also waive all 
attorneys’ fees incurred by the association in connection with the violation. 
  
The proposed changes to HRS Section 514B-146 are quite substantial without any stated 
compelling reason for the changes. If HRS Section 514B-146 is to be amended, the proposed 
wording should be amended for clarification. For example, the new subsection (g) states that if 
any amount paid by a unit owner is found to be unsubstantiated, the unit owner shall be entitled 
to a refund. However, it is not clear who makes the determination that an amount paid is 
“unsubstantiated.” Presumably, this determination should be made by a court of competent 
jurisdiction and if so, this should be stated. It should be made clear that the 60-day stay provided 
for in subjection (f) shall not apply to the recordation of a lien by the association because it is 
conceivable that the association will need to record a lien during that time period to preserve the 
priority of its lien. 
  
Finally, HRS Section 514B-146 requires owners to pay common expense assessments before 
disputing those amounts, but allows owners to dispute all other assessments prior to payment. 
This can place significant financial burdens on associations where the amounts at issue have 
been paid by the Association to third parties, such as payment of submetered utilities. The right 
to dispute charges prior to payment should be limited to charges for which the association has 
not advance funds, such as fines, late fees, or interest. 
  
For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully OPPOSE H.B. No. 106 and urge your Committee 
to defer this measure. Alternatively, if it is to be passed by the Committee, I urge the 
Committee to amend the bill to address the issues discussed above. 
  
Respectfully submitted, 
Carol Walker
