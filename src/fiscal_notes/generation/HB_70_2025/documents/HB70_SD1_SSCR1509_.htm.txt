H.D. 1
S.D. 1
Honorable Ronald D. Kouchi
President of the Senate
Thirty-Third State Legislature
Regular Session of 2025
State of Hawaii
Sir:
Your Committee on
Judiciary, to which was referred H.B. No. 70, H.D. 1, S.D. 1,
entitled:
"A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO CONDOMINIUM,"
begs leave to report as follows:
The
purpose and intent of this measure is to:
(1)
Require budget summaries to contain all
required information without referring the reader to other portions of the
budget; and
(2)
Clarify the ability to enforce compliance with
budget summary and replacement reserves requirements and provides that an
association has the burden of proving compliance.
Your Committee
received testimony in support of this measure from the Hawai
ʻ
i Association of
REALTORS, Community Associations Institute Hawaii, Hawaii First Realty, and
five individuals.
Your Committee
received testimony in opposition to this measure from the Palehua Townhouse
Association, Honolulu Tower Association of Apartment Owners, and eleven
individuals.
Your Committee
received comments on this measure from one individual.
Your Committee
finds that condominium owners are entitled to disclosure of information about
the replacement reserves maintained by a condominium association in which they
own a unit.
Additionally, the
Legislature recently passed Act 62, Session Laws of Hawaii 2022, which requires
a budget summary with additional details to be prepared on the financial
condition of an association.
This
measure will further enhance transparency and provide both owners and
prospective purchasers with valuable insights into the association's financial
health by requiring these budget summaries to contain all required information.
As affirmed by the
record of votes of the members of your Committee on Judiciary that is attached
to this report, your Committee is in accord with the intent and purpose of H.B.
No. 70, H.D. 1, S.D. 1, and recommends that it pass Third Reading.
Respectfully submitted on behalf
of the members of the Committee on Judiciary,
