RE: House Bill 70, HD1, Relating to Condominium 
 
HEARING: Friday, March 14, 2025, at 9:30 a.m. 
 
 
Aloha Chair Keohokalole, Vice Chair Fukunaga, and Members of the Committee: 
 
My name is Lyndsey Garcia, Director of Advocacy, testifying on behalf of the 
Hawai‘i Association of REALTORS® (“HAR”), the voice of real estate in Hawaii and its 
over 10,000 members. HAR supports House Bill 70, HD1, which requires budget 
summaries to contain all required information without referring the reader to other 
portions of the budget. States that the defense of good faith compliance is unavailable 
to any association whose board adopts a budget that omits the required budget 
summary. Clarifies the ability to enforce compliance with budget summary and 
replacement reserves requirements and provides that an association has the burden of 
proving compliance. Effective 7/1/3000. 
 
In 2023, the Legislature passed, and Act 199 was signed into law, requiring a 
budget summary with additional details to be prepared on the financial condition of an 
association. As such, requiring these budget summaries to contain all required 
information enhances transparency and provides both owners and prospective 
purchasers with valuable insights into the association's financial health. 
 
Mahalo for the opportunity to provide testimony on this measure.

Re:
EB 70 HD1 SUPPORT
Dear Chair Keohokalole, Vice Chair Fukunaga and Committee Members:
CAI supports HB 70 HD1.
HB 70 HD1 will protect consumers by
excluding the defense of good faith for an association if its board
adopts
a budget that omits the required detailed budget
summary.
HB 70
HD1 also clarifies standing requirements and the burden of
proving substantial compliance.
Financial transparency is fundamental.
The requirement of a
budget
summary is
an important tool to
enable
owners to easily
understand the financial condition of the Association.
The
items
to
be
included in
the
summary
are
expressed in
Hawaii
Revised Statutes
(“HRS”)
§5l4B—l48(a)(l—8).
Those
items
must be determined through the budgeting process,
so the burden of
including a substantially compliant summary is light.
This is particularly so since most of those items reference
objective matters (e.g., disclose “cash or accrual” budgeting)
and
the estimated amounts to be included are to be derived from the
work of experts.
Association directors are entitled to reasonably
rely upon experts.
HRS §5l4B—lO6 provides, in relevant part, that:
In the performance of their duties, officers and members of
the
board
shall
owe
the
association
a
fiduciary
duty
and
exercise the degree of care and loyalty required of an officer
or director of a corporation organized under chapter 414D.
The general standards for directors are detailed in HRS §414D—149.
That section provides,
in relevant part, that:

HB 70 HD1 provides that “The association shall have the burden
of proving substantial compliance with this section”,
which is in
accord with
an association's existing burden
under current
law.
HRS §514B—l48(g) presently provides, in relevant part, that:
In any proceeding to enforce compliance,
a board that has not
prepared an annual operating budget and reserve study shall
have the burden of proving it has complied with this section.
HB 70 HD1 will enforce budget discipline in a manner that remains
consistent with self—governance.
Please pass
HB 70 HD1.
CAI Legislative Action Committee,
by
Its Ch ir

(a)
A director shall discharge the director's duties
as a director, including the director's duties as a member of a committee:
ll)
In good faith;
(2)
In a manner that is consistent with the director's duty of loyalty to the corporation;
(3) With the care an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would exercise under similar
circumstances;
and
(4) In a manner the director reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the corporation.
(b)
In discharging the director's
duties,
a director is entitled to rely
on
information,
opinions,
reports,
or
statements,
including
financial
statements
and other
financial
data, if
prepared or presented by:
(1)
One or more officers or employees of the corporation whom the director reasonably believes
to be reliable and competent in the matters presented;
(2)
Legal counsel, public accountants,
or other persons as to matters the director reasonably
believes are within the person's professional or expert competence;
or
(3)
A committee of the board of which the director is not a member,
as to matters within its
jurisdiction, if the director reasonably believes the committee merits confidence.
(c)
A director is not acting in good faith if the director has knowledge concerning the matter
in question that makes reliance otherwise permitted by subsection
(b)
unwarranted.
(d)
A director is not liable to the corporation,
any member,
or
any other person
for
any
action taken or not taken as a director, if the director acted in compliance with this section.
(e)
A director shall not
be deemed to be
a trustee with respect to the corporation or with
respect to any property held or administered by the corporation, including without limit, property
that may be subject to restrictions imposed by the donor or transferor of the property.
(f) Any person who serves as a director to the corporation without remuneration or expectation

Comments:  
Honolulu Tower is a 396 unit high rise located at Beretania and Maunakea Streets. On Feb. 3, 
2025 the Board of Directors of the Association of Apartment Owners of Honolulu Tower 
unanimously voted to oppose HB70 and asks that you defer this measure. 
  
Section 2, subsection 1 of the measure (amending subsection (d)): “The defense of good faith 
shall be unavailable to an association whenever its board adopts a budget that omits the summary 
required by subsection (a).” This sentence may cause disputes and litigation in the event that an 
association includes a summary with a budget as specified in HRS Section 514B- 148(a), but an 
owner contends that the summary does not strictly comply with all of the requirements. 
  
 To avoid potential problems and litigation, the second sentence of subsection (d) should read: 
“The defense of good faith shall be unavailable to an association whenever its board adopts a 
budget that completely omits the summary required by subsection (a).” 
  
 Second sentence in Section 2, subsection 2 of the measure (amending subsection (g)) should 
be deleted: “The association shall have the burden of proving substantial compliance with this 
section in any such action.” When a plaintiff brings an action, that party has the burden of proof. 
It is inconsistent with general principles of law to allow a plaintiff to file an action without any 
burden of proof. If an owner brings an action, the owner should be required to prove that the 
association failed to meet the requirements of Section 514B-148(a). The statute may expose 
associations to costly frivolous litigation over whether they complied with Section 514B-148(a).

Dear Senator Keohokalole, Chair, Senator Fukunaga, Vice Chair, and Members of the 
Committee: 
I OPPOSE H.B. No. 70, H.D.1. 
First, I oppose the proposed sentence in Section 2, subsection 1 of the measure (amending 
subsection (d)) which reads: “The defense of good faith shall be unavailable to an association 
whenever its board adopts a budget that omits the summary required by subsection (a).” This 
sentence may cause disputes and litigation in the event that an association includes a summary 
with a budget as specified in HRS Section 514B-148(a), but an owner contends that the summary 
does not strictly comply with the comprehensive list of requirements for the summary as set forth 
in the statute. Given the level of detail in the specifications contained in Section 514B-148(a), an 
Association can easily inadvertently omit information from the summary, or information in the 
summary may turn out to be inaccurate or incomplete. For example, Section 514B-148(a)(6)(B) 
requires the disclosure of any component of association property omitted from the reserve study 
and the basis for the omission. If a component is inadvertently omitted from the summary and 
the omission is not disclosed, an owner could argue that the association breached its duty to 
submit a summary meeting the requirements of Section 514B-148(a). 
To avoid potential problems and litigation, the second sentence of subsection (d) should read: 
“The defense of good faith shall be unavailable to an association whenever its board adopts a 
budget that completely omits the summary required by subsection (a).” 
Second, the new subsection (g) provides that “[a]ny unit owner shall have standing to bring an 
action alleging a violation of this section against an association that the unit owner is a member 
of, and may seek an injunction to enforce compliance with this section by the association’s 
board. The association shall have the burden of proving substantial compliance with this section 
in any such action.” The last sentence which shifts the burden of proof on the association should 
be deleted. 
When a plaintiff brings an action, that party has the burden of proof. In some instances, the 
burden of proof may shift to the defendant, for example, after the plaintiff makes a prima facie 
showing of certain facts. However, it is inconsistent with general principles of law to allow an 
owner to file an action without any burden of proof. There is no justification for shifting the 

burden of proof to an association. If an owner brings an action, the owner should be required to 
prove that the association failed to meet the requirements of Section 514B-148(a). The statute 
may expose associations to costly frivolous litigation over whether they complied with Section 
514B-148(a).

I am an owner occupant and board member of a Honolulu condominium. I am also a member of 
CAI. In reading testimony from a prior committee, I learned that CAI supports this bill. They 
never informed me or consulted me. I disagree with their position, oppose the bill, and ask that 
you defer it. 
As you are well aware, there are litigious condo owners. They are attracted by gray areas. For 
example, Section 2, subsection 1 of the measure (amending subsection (d)): “The defense of 
good faith shall be unavailable to an association whenever its board adopts a budget that omits 
the summary required by subsection (a).” This sentence may cause disputes and litigation in the 
event that an association includes a summary with a budget as specified in HRS Section 514B- 
148(a), but an owner contends that the summary does not strictly comply with all of the 
requirements. 
This bill is also inconsistent with the general principles of law, in that it allows a plaintiff to file 
an action without any burden of proof. If an owner brings an action, the owner should be 
required to prove that the association failed to meet the requirements of Section 514B-148(a). 
The statute may expose associations to costly frivolous litigation over whether they complied 
with Section 514B-148(a). 
Hopefully you are aware that when associations are sued, their insurance carriers raise 
premiums, or worse, no longer offer coverage. The language of this bill is playing into the hands 
of those companies, especially at a time when premiums are rising and legislators are seeking 
ways to stop this flow of money. 
We already have a self appointed “king” wearing a crown rampaging through the federal 
government. Hawaii should not follow his example by contravening general principles of law. 
Please defer this bill.

Comments:  
Aloha e Committee Chairs and Members, 
My name is Miri Yi, and I am submitting testimony in strong support of HB 70. 
For years, my Honolulu condominium has experienced deferred maintenance, poor reserve 
management, blatant abuse of authority, selective enforcement and a complete lack of 
transparency in operations and administration. This includes issues with financial data, meeting 
minutes, contractor vetting, bids, scope of work, invoices, reserve fund management, and much 
more. 
In 2024, our condominium's liability insurance premium skyrocketed by an alarming 829%, 
rising to over $1,037,000 annually. This sharp increase came without sufficient explanation or 
any fair warning. As a result, all owners were unilaterally assessed fees exceeding $5,200 in 
some cases, to cover the depleted reserve funds that were used to pay for this insurance increase. 
There is a complete lack of accountability from the Board of Directors (BOD), property 
management agencies, and on-site management and unskilled maintenance workers/vendors. The 
BOD clearly demonstrates a troubling lack of knowledge of and adherence to, Hawaii Revised 
Statutes (HRS), CC&Rs, Bylaws, House Rules and other regulations. Furthermore, they sorely 
lack basic communication skills, common decency/etiquette and routinely utilize the extremely 
adversarial and malverse parliamentarians to censor homeowners' speech and even deny access 
to Zoom meetings. Emails and phone calls are not responded to. 
The insurance broker/agent for our condominium refuses to respond to questions that the BOD or 
property managers are unwilling to answer. Additionally, they refuse to provide policy details 
upon request, adding to the confusion and frustration. 
The lack of transparency regarding policy coverage and the overall mismanagement of the 
reserve funds and process are of great concern. It is particularly troubling that the BODs 
routinely use attorneys to send letters to owners and field questions at special meetings, rather 
than providing clear answers directly. 
I urge you to pass this bill and provide greater support for homeowners, who are highly 
vulnerable to terrible abuse and mismanagement in the "self-governed" AOAO/HOA 
environment. 

Thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony in strong support of this bill. 
Very Respectfully, 
Miri Yi 
Honolulu 96818

does not strictly comply with the comprehensive list of requirements for the summary as set forth 
in the statute. Given the level of detail in the specifications contained in Section 514B-148(a), an 
Association can easily inadvertently omit information from the summary, or information in the 
summary may turn out to be inaccurate or incomplete. For example, Section 514B-148(a)(6)(B) 
requires the disclosure of any component of association property omitted from the reserve study 
and the basis for the omission. If a component is inadvertently omitted from the summary and 
the omission is not disclosed, an owner could argue that the association breached its duty to 
submit a summary meeting the requirements of Section 514B-148(a). 
To avoid potential problems and litigation, the second sentence of subsection (d) should read: 
“The defense of good faith shall be unavailable to an association whenever its board adopts a 
budget that completely omits the summary required by subsection (a).” 
Second, the new subsection (g) provides that “[a]ny unit owner shall have standing to bring an 
action alleging a violation of this section against an association that the unit owner is a member 
of, and may seek an injunction to enforce compliance with this section by the association’s 
board. The association shall have the burden of proving substantial compliance with this section 
in any such action.” The last sentence which shifts the burden of proof on the association should 
be deleted. 
When a plaintiff brings an action, that party has the burden of proof. In some instances, the 
burden of proof may shift to the defendant, for example, after the plaintiff makes a prima facie 
showing of certain facts. However, it is inconsistent with general principles of law to allow an 
owner to file an action without any burden of proof. There is no justification for shifting the 
burden of proof to an association. If an owner brings an action, the owner should be required to 

prove that the association failed to meet the requirements of Section 514B-148(a). The statute 
may expose associations to costly frivolous litigation over whether they complied with Section 
514B-148(a).

I OPPOSE H.B. No. 70, H.D.1 
Removing the defense of good faith allowed to an association subjects the association to an 
unreasonable burden if an owner alleges the association did not strictly comply with the 
comprehensive list of requirements for the summary as set forth in the statute. 
Further, shifting the burden of proof to require an association to prove that it did strictly comply 
with the detailed specifications in the list of requirements in the summary is punitive.   
If a plaintiff brings an action, that party properly has the burden of proof.  If an owner brings an 
action, the owner should be required to prove that the association failed to meet the requirements 
of Section 514B-148(a).  It is inconsistent with general principles of law to allow an owner to  
file an action without any burden of proof. 
 
 
Respectfully submitted, 
Pamela J. Schell

1. Reserve studies have not been conducted for ~8 years. In 2025: my reserve fees doubled with 
a 20.15% increase and deficit of $14,783 per unit, to be made up in 3 years by the increase in 
HOA fees. 
2. I pay~ $15,000 in yearly fees. Developer litigation started in 2018 and settled in April 2024 
=15 M. I still have no unit “common element” repairs since the litigation.

TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF HB70 HD1 
 
For:  The Committee on Commerce and Consumer Protection 
 
 
DATE: 
Friday, March 14, 2025 
TIME: 
9:30 AM 
PLACE: 
Conference Room 229 & 
Videoconference 
State Capitol 
415 South Beretania Street 
  
 
Aloha Chair Keohokalole, Vice Chair Fukunaga, and Members of the Committee, 
 
My name is Gregory Misakian and I have been advocating for the rights of 
condominium owners in Hawaii since 2021, when I realized how much misconduct 
and corruption there is within many condominium associations throughout 
Hawaii, in addition to misconduct and corruption within numerous large 
management companies that manage and oversee condominium associations. 
 
I currently serve as 1st Vice President of the Kokua Council, an elder advocacy 
organization in Hawaii since 1972, a Director at the Hawaii Alliance for Retired 
Americans, and a member of the Waikiki Neighborhood Board, where we have 
advocated for better consumer protections for condominium owners in a 
resolution adopted in 2023 (also adopted by other Neighborhood Boards). 
 
As many as 1/3 of the population of Hawaii lives in condominiums, including many 
legislators and their friends and families.  It has been shown with evidence to 
support, including many news stories and a great deal of testimony, that 
condominium owners are being subjected to abusive and predatory practices, 
often at the direction of the condominium association’s President and Board, with 
management company agents and association attorneys being willful participants.  
I also know this first-hand, because it’s happening at my condominium 
association, where I and others have been subjected to unlawful retaliation in 
violation of HRS 514B-191.  Our former Maintenance Manager was retaliated

against for simply raising valid concerns regarding serious building issues that 
needed to be addressed by the Board.  The Board President chose to suspend him 
without informing the Board, which is also a violation of our governing 
documents, as only the “Board” can make employment decisions.  And now there 
is a lawsuit against the association, which can be seen at eCourt Kokua – Antonio 
Vierra vs. Keoni Ana AOAO. 
 
This Board President is also a former Deputy Attorney General in Hawaii, and a 
former Corporation Counsel Attorney for the City and County of Honolulu. He is 
currently employed by our former association law firm (Kobayashi, Sugita & Goda 
LLC), and was working there before anyone on the Board or the association was 
even informed, and while they were still our association law firm.  Ultimately his 
actions have cost our association a substantial amount of money in legal expenses 
and other losses, and the future will only tell what is next regarding assessments 
and maintenance fees when the current litigation is concluded.  I anticipate more 
litigation and more harm to the association, due to his and other’s bad acts, which 
there are many of, including evidence of fraud, contract fraud, not obtaining 
permits for projects, and violating a Department of Planning and Permitting stop 
work order 3x in one week, with HPD called to take reports.  Abuse of power 
seems to be well established in condominium association Boards, but also seen in 
many other areas of leadership throughout Hawaii, including at the legislature. 
 
While I support HB70 HD1 and its intentions, owners still have the burden to go to 
court for enforcement, which can be very costly.  The only real solution to address 
serious issues within condominium associations and their proper management, is 
to have enforcement of the laws that you enact.    
 
Please read and support HB890 and SB1265 (companion bill) for an Ombudsman’s 
Office for Condominium Associations. 
 
HB890 - RELATING TO CONDOMINIUM ASSOCIATIONS. (Ombudsman) 
SB1265 - RELATING TO CONDOMINIUM ASSOCIATIONS. (Ombudsman) 
 
And also: 
 
HB1209 - RELATING TO CONDOMINIUM ASSOCIATIONS. (Attorneys’ Fees)

HB1311 - RELATING TO CONDOMINIUM PROXY VOTING. 
HB1312 - RELATING TO ASSOCIATION MANAGERS. 
HB1313 - RELATING TO BOARD MEMBERS. 
HB1315 - RELATING TO PARLIAMENTARIANS. 
HB1447 - RELATING TO MANAGING AGENTS. 
SB1623 - RELATING TO MANAGING AGENTS. 
 
Sadly, as often is the case at the legislature, where some often work for campaign 
donations before they work for the people of Hawaii, none of these bills were 
scheduled.  It is not too late to take what is in these bills and amend some of the 
bills the Committee Chairs chose, which mostly do not provide the best solutions 
or enforceable solutions without condominium owners having to go to court.  The 
#1 goal is to help condominium owners so they do not have to go to court, and 
have a place to go where they are treated fairly, and where efficient and timely 
resolutions to issues and concerns can be administered (i.e., the Ombudsman’s 
Office for Condominium Associations).  
 
I also ask our legislators to provide a simple breakdown of what they think this 
section will cost condominium owners if they attempt to enforce it? 
 
Any unit owner shall have standing to bring an action alleging a violation of this 
section against an association that the unit owner is a member of, and may seek 
an injunction to enforce compliance with this section by the association’s 
board.  The association shall have the burden of proving substantial compliance 
with this section in any such action.” 
 
Will there be a state fund to subsidize the legal costs that may run into the many 
thousands of dollars if an owner tried to bring an action alleging a violation?  Will 
you establish free legal counsel for those who can’t afford it (as you want to do for 
illegal aliens)?   
 
The people of Hawaii are counting on you to enact condominium consumer 
protection laws that help the residents of Hawaii, and not ones that just give the 
illusion of helping.   
 
Gregory Misakian
