Dear Committee, 
 
My name is Richard Emery and a thirty-year condominium industry veteran.  I am a CAI 
Reserve Specialist (RS), reviewed or performed hundreds of Hawaii condominium reserve 
studies, participated on CAI’s national task force for reserve study public policy, and 
currently serve as an expert in numerous disputes or litigation related to condominium 
budget and reserve studies.  Let’s remember that the national definition is of a reserve 
study – A budgeting tool not based on any professional review.  It is simply a planning 
document to give an association a best chance to accumulate reserve funds as building 
components come due and need repair or replacement.   The underlying data can change 
every year as components age. 
 
I would be the first to admit that I have seen poor work product by some associations 
recognizing on the other hand many do a stellar job.  That being said, a properly prepared 
reserve study is invaluable to an association.  A reserve study can be hundreds of pages in 
length that the untrained eye will not understand its implications. 
 
As the condominium industry is so broad it becomes impossible to set mandatory identical 
standards.  In 2023 the legislature passed Act 199 that was signed into law mandating a 
budget summary that brings to the forefront the true status of ther condominijum’s 
reserves.  It is my belief that the industry itself will be forced to correct itself if the 
information is clearly disclosed.  Unfortunately some associations look to an easy way to 
comply and use the summary to vaguely refer back to the original document.  Disclosure is 
important.  The best solution is to force boards and managing agent to comply with the 
intent of Act 199 by taking away their good faith exemption if they do not comply.  I support 
HB 70.

Comments:  
Honolulu Tower is a 396 unit high rise located at Beretania and Maunakea Streets. On Feb. 3, 
2025 the Board of Directors of the Association of Apartment Owners of Honolulu Tower 
unanimously voted to oppose HB70 and asks that you defer this measure. 
  
Section 2, subsection 1 of the measure (amending subsection (d)): “The defense of good faith 
shall be unavailable to an association whenever its board adopts a budget that omits the summary 
required by subsection (a).” This sentence may cause disputes and litigation in the event that an 
association includes a summary with a budget as specified in HRS Section 514B- 148(a), but an 
owner contends that the summary does not strictly comply with all of the requirements. 
  
 To avoid potential problems and litigation, the second sentence of subsection (d) should read: 
“The defense of good faith shall be unavailable to an association whenever its board adopts a 
budget that completely omits the summary required by subsection (a).” 
  
 Second sentence in Section 2, subsection 2 of the measure (amending subsection (g)) should 
be deleted: “The association shall have the burden of proving substantial compliance with this 
section in any such action.” When a plaintiff brings an action, that party has the burden of proof. 
It is inconsistent with general principles of law to allow a plaintiff to file an action without any 
burden of proof. If an owner brings an action, the owner should be required to prove that the 
association failed to meet the requirements of Section 514B-148(a). The statute may expose 
associations to costly frivolous litigation over whether they complied with Section 514B-148(a).

Dear Representative Tarnas, Chair, Representative Poepoe, Vice Chair, and Members of the 
Committee: 
  
I OPPOSE H.B. No. 70, H.D.1. 
  
First, I oppose the proposed sentence in Section 2, subsection 1 of the measure (amending 
subsection (d)) which reads: “The defense of good faith shall be unavailable to an association 
whenever its board adopts a budget that omits the summary required by subsection (a).” This 
sentence may cause disputes and litigation in the event that an association includes a summary 
with a budget as specified in HRS Section 514B-148(a), but an owner contends that the summary 
does not strictly comply with the comprehensive list of requirements for the summary as set forth 
in the statute. Given the level of detail in the specifications contained in Section 514B-148(a), an 
Association can easily inadvertently omit information from the summary, or information in the 
summary may turn out to be inaccurate or incomplete. For example, Section 514B-148(a)(6)(B) 
requires the disclosure of any component of association property omitted from the reserve study 
and the basis for the omission. If a component is inadvertently omitted from the summary and 
the omission is not disclosed, an owner could argue that the association breached its duty to 
submit a summary meeting the requirements of Section 514B-148(a). 
  
To avoid potential problems and litigation, the second sentence of subsection (d) should read: 
“The defense of good faith shall be unavailable to an association whenever its board adopts a 
budget that completely omits the summary required by subsection (a).” 
  
Second, the new subsection (g) provides that “[a]ny unit owner shall have standing to bring an 
action alleging a violation of this section against an association that the unit owner is a member 
of, and may seek an injunction to enforce compliance with this section by the association’s 
board. The association shall have the burden of proving substantial compliance with this section 

in any such action.” The last sentence which shifts the burden of proof on the association should 
be deleted. 
  
When a plaintiff brings an action, that party has the burden of proof. In some instances, the 
burden of proof may shift to the defendant, for example, after the plaintiff makes a prima facie 
showing of certain facts. However, it is inconsistent with general principles of law to allow an 
owner to file an action without any burden of proof. There is no justification for shifting the 
burden of proof to an association. If an owner brings an action, the owner should be required to 
prove that the association failed to meet the requirements of Section 514B-148(a). The statute 
may expose associations to costly frivolous litigation over whether they complied with Section 
514B-148(a).

I am an owner occupant and board member of the Honolulu condominium, I am also a member 
of CAI. In reading testimony from the prior committee, I learned that CAI supports this bill. 
They never informed me or consulted me. I disagree with their position, oppose the bill, and ask 
that you defer it. 
As you are well aware, there are litigious condo owners. They are attracted by gray areas. For 
example, Section 2, subsection 1 of the measure (amending subsection (d)): “The defense of 
good faith shall be unavailable to an association whenever its board adopts a budget that omits 
the summary required by subsection (a).” This sentence may cause disputes and litigation in the 
event that an association includes a summary with a budget as specified in HRS Section 514B- 
148(a), but an owner contends that the summary does not strictly comply with all of the 
requirements. 
This bill is also inconsistent with the general principles of law, in that it allows a plaintiff to file 
an action without any burden of proof. If an owner brings an action, the owner should be 
required to prove that the association failed to meet the requirements of Section 514B-148(a). 
The statute may expose associations to costly frivolous litigation over whether they complied 
with Section 514B-148(a). 
We already have a self appointed “king” wearing a crown rampaging through the federal 
government. Hawaii should not follow his example by contravening general principles of law. 
Please defer this bill.

Dear Representative Tarnas, Chair, Representative Poepoe, Vice Chair, and Members of the 
Committee: 
  
I OPPOSE H.B. No. 70, H.D.1.   
  
First, I oppose the proposed sentence in Section 2, subsection 1 of the measure (amending 
subsection (d)) which reads: “The defense of good faith shall be unavailable to an association 
whenever its board adopts a budget that omits the summary required by subsection (a).”  This 
sentence may cause disputes and litigation in the event that an association includes a summary 
with a budget as specified in HRS Section 514B-148(a), but an owner contends that the summary 
does not strictly comply with the comprehensive list of requirements for the summary as set forth 
in the statute.  Given the level of detail in the specifications contained in Section 514B-148(a), an 
Association can easily inadvertently omit information from the summary, or information in the 
summary may turn out to be inaccurate or incomplete. For example, Section 514B-148(a)(6)(B) 
requires the disclosure of any component of association property omitted from the reserve study 
and the basis for the omission. If a component is inadvertently omitted from the summary and 
the omission is not disclosed, an owner could argue that the association breached its duty to 
submit a summary meeting the requirements of Section 514B-148(a). 
  
To avoid potential problems and litigation, the second sentence of subsection (d) should read: 
“The defense of good faith shall be unavailable to an association whenever its board adopts a 
budget that completely omits the summary required by subsection (a).” 
  
Second, the new subsection (g) provides that “[a]ny unit owner shall have standing to bring an 
action alleging a violation of this section against an association that the unit owner is a member 
of, and may seek an injunction to enforce compliance with this section by the association’s 
board.  The association shall have the burden of proving substantial compliance with this section 

in any such action.”  The last sentence which shifts the burden of proof on the association should 
be deleted.

It's already difficult enough to get owners to serve on the board. AOAO Lakeview Sands hasn't 
had a full board of 5 owners in a long time. We usually have to function with only 3 or 4 of the 
seats filled. We need to encourage owners to serve not scare them from trying.

RE:  HB 70 Support Bill 
Dear JHA, 
1. In 2025, I pay about $15,000 in yearly fees and within 10 years it may approach over $30,000. 
2. 2025 Reserve deficit per unit is $14,783 ($217 a month in double reserve fees). My 
association has not done reserve studies in 8 years (former BOD statement) and has denied my 
unit maintenance for years. 
3. Association HOA Tax Scheme? Annual meeting March 15, 2025: 
EXCESS OF MEMBERSHIP INCOME OVER MEMBERSHIP EXPENSES: "Be it 
Resolved, that any excess of membership income over membership expenses the fiscal year 
ending January 31, 2025, shall be applied against the subsequent tax year member 
assessments as provided by IRS Ruling 70-604. 
• 
This may include a 2024 landscape contract reduction of up to $80,000 and an April 
2024: 15- million construction defect settlement with monthly interest about $14,000 per 
month? 
• 
For 3 years I have paid for “common element” scheduled mandated services never 
received and I want the excess membership income refunded to me. 
5. I have filed DCCA complaints for financial records pursuant to HRS 514 B. 
Please protect homeowners, not industry special interests or lobbyists. Legislators, PLEASE 
SUPPORT MY REQUEST FOR INVESTIGATION.

TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF HB70 HD1 
 
 
For:  The Committee on Judiciary & Hawaiian Affairs (JHA) 
 
DATE: 
Tuesday, February 25, 2025 
TIME: 
2:00 p.m. 
PLACE: VIA VIDEOCONFERENCE 
Conference Room 325 
State Capitol 
415 South Beretania Street 
 
 
Aloha Chair Tarnas, Vice Chair Poepoe, and members of the Committee, 
 
My name is Gregory Misakian and I have been advocating for the rights of 
condominium owners in Hawaii since 2021, when I realized how much misconduct 
and corruption there is within many condominium associations throughout 
Hawaii, in addition to misconduct and corruption within numerous large 
management companies that manage and oversee condominium associations. 
 
As many as 1/3 of the population of Hawaii lives in condominiums, including many 
legislators and their friends and families.  It has been shown with evidence to 
support, including many news stories and a great deal of testimony, that 
condominium owners are being subjected to abusive and predatory practices, 
often at the direction of the condominium association’s President and Board, with 
management company agents and association attorneys being willful participants.   
 
Simply said, no matter how many Acts that are enACTed, many Directors on 
condominium association boards simply don’t care and do whatever they want, 
which often includes not ACTing like adults, and ACTions that are contrary to the 
governing documents and State laws.  To break it down further for our esteemed 
legislators … they ACT like children, but even this analogy is flawed because 
children ACTually ACT better. 
 

2 
 
In another life before Hawaii, I did some ACTing work on an Investigation 
Discovery show called “I (Almost) Got Away with It.”  In Hawaii that show would 
have to be renamed to “I (Almost Always) Got Away with It” when speaking of 
misconduct and corruption at condominium associations. 
 
While the ACT analogy and pun might seem funny, there is nothing funny about 
how badly many condominium associations are being managed, and the 
misconduct and corruption that exits. 
 
While I support HB70 HD1 and its intentions, owners still have the burden to go to 
court for enforcement, which can be very costly.  The only real solution to address 
serious issues within condominium associations and their proper management, is 
to have enforcement of the laws that you enACT.   (And yes, it’s hard to let this go 
once I started the theme).   
 
Please read and support HB890 and SB1265 (companion bill) for an Ombudsman’s 
Office for Condominium Associations. 
 
HB890 - RELATING TO CONDOMINIUM ASSOCIATIONS. (Ombudsman) 
SB1265 - RELATING TO CONDOMINIUM ASSOCIATIONS. (Ombudsman) 
 
And also: 
 
HB1209 - RELATING TO CONDOMINIUM ASSOCIATIONS. (Attorneys’ Fees) 
HB1311 - RELATING TO CONDOMINIUM PROXY VOTING. 
HB1312 - RELATING TO ASSOCIATION MANAGERS. 
HB1313 - RELATING TO BOARD MEMBERS. 
HB1315 - RELATING TO PARLIAMENTARIANS. 
 
Sadly, as often is the case at the legislature, where some often work for campaign 
donations before they work for the people of Hawaii, none of these bills were 
scheduled.  It is not too late to take what is in these bills and amend some of the 
bills the Committee Chairs chose, which mostly do not provide the best solutions 
or enforceable solutions without condominium owners having to go to court.  The 
#1 goal is to help condominium owners so they do not have to go to court, and 
have a place to go where they are treated fairly, and where efficient and timely 

3 
 
resolutions to issues and concerns can be administered (i.e., the Ombudsman’s 
Office for Condominium Associations).  
 
I also ask our legislators to provide a simple breakdown of what they think this 
section will cost condominium owners if they attempt to enforce it? 
 
Any unit owner shall have standing to bring an action alleging a violation of this 
section against an association that the unit owner is a member of, and may seek 
an injunction to enforce compliance with this section by the association’s 
board.  The association shall have the burden of proving substantial compliance 
with this section in any such action.” 
 
Will there be a state fund to subsidize the legal costs that may run into the 
thousands of dollars?  Will you establish free legal counsel for those who can’t 
afford it (as you want to do for illegal aliens)?   
 
For those who don’t know me, I currently serve as the 1st Vice President of the 
Kokua Council and was President for most of 2024.  The Kokua Council advocates 
for our kupuna and lesser advantaged.  I also serve on the Waikiki Neighborhood 
Board, where we have advocated for better consumer protections for 
condominium owners in a resolution adopted in 2023 (also adopted by other 
Neighborhood Boards). 
 
The people of Hawaii are counting on you to ACT, and I respectfully ask all on the 
committee and all legislators to please support HB70 HD1 and the other bills 
listed.   
 
Mahalo, 
 
Gregory Misakian

with a budget as specified in HRS Section 514B-148(a), but an owner contends that the summary 
does not strictly comply with the comprehensive list of requirements for the summary as set forth 
in the statute. Given the level of detail in the specifications contained in Section 514B-148(a), an 
Association can easily inadvertently omit information from the summary, or information in the 
summary may turn out to be inaccurate or incomplete. For example, Section 514B-148(a)(6)(B) 
requires the disclosure of any component of association property omitted from the reserve study 
and the basis for the omission. If a component is inadvertently omitted from the summary and 
the omission is not disclosed, an owner could argue that the association breached its duty to 
submit a summary meeting the requirements of Section 514B-148(a). 
To avoid potential problems and litigation, the second sentence of subsection (d) should read: 
“The defense of good faith shall be unavailable to an association whenever its board adopts a 
budget that completely omits the summary required by subsection (a).” 
Second, the new subsection (g) provides that “[a]ny unit owner shall have standing to bring an 
action alleging a violation of this section against an association that the unit owner is a member 
of, and may seek an injunction to enforce compliance with this section by the association’s 
board. The association shall have the burden of proving substantial compliance with this section 
in any such action.” The last sentence which shifts the burden of proof on the association should 
be deleted. 
When a plaintiff brings an action, that party has the burden of proof. In some instances, the 
burden of proof may shift to the defendant, for example, after the plaintiff makes a prima facie 
showing of certain facts. However, it is inconsistent with general principles of law to allow an 
owner to file an action without any burden of proof. There is no justification for shifting the 
burden of proof to an association. If an owner brings an action, the owner should be required to

prove that the association failed to meet the requirements of Section 514B-148(a). The statute 
may expose associations to costly frivolous litigation over whether they complied with Section 
514B-148(a).
