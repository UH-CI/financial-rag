RE: House Bill 70, HD1, SD1, Relating to Condominium 
 
HEARING: Tuesday, March 25, 2025, at 10:01 a.m. 
 
 
Aloha Chair Rhoads, Vice Chair Gabbard, and Members of the Committee: 
 
My name is Lyndsey Garcia, Director of Advocacy, testifying on behalf of the 
Hawai‘i Association of REALTORS® (“HAR”), the voice of real estate in Hawaii and its 
over 10,000 members. HAR supports House Bill 70, HD1, SD1, which requires budget 
summaries to contain all required information without referring the reader to other 
portions of the budget.  Clarifies the ability to enforce compliance with budget summary 
and replacement reserves requirements and provides that an association has the 
burden of proving compliance.  Effective 7/1/3000. 
 
In 2023, the Legislature passed, and Act 199 was signed into law, requiring a 
budget summary with additional details to be prepared on the financial condition of an 
association. As such, requiring these budget summaries to contain all required 
information enhances transparency and provides both owners and prospective 
purchasers with valuable insights into the association's financial health. 
 
Mahalo for the opportunity to provide testimony on this measure.

CAI supports this bill.   
The required budget summary enables owners and purchasers to have a ready understanding of 
the financial condition of an association.  All required information should be contained in the 
budget summary itself. 
The burden of proving substantial compliance is appropriate.

association shall have the burden of proving substantial compliance with this section in any such

I am an owner occupant and board member of a Honolulu condominium. I am also a member of 
CAI. In reading testimony from a senate committee, I learned that CAI supports this bill. They 
never informed me or consulted me. I disagree with their position, oppose the bill, and ask that 
you defer it. 
The new subsection (g) provides that “[a]ny unit owner shall have standing to bring an action 
alleging a violation of this section against an association that the unit owner is a member of, and 
may seek an injunction to enforce compliance with this section by the association’s board. The 
association shall have the burden of proving substantial compliance with this section in any such 
action.” This provision is inconsistent with the general principles of law, in that it allows a 
plaintiff to file an action without any burden of proof. If an owner brings an action, the owner 
should be required to prove that the association failed to meet the requirements of Section 514B-
148(a). The statute may expose associations to costly frivolous litigation over whether they 
complied with Section 514B-148(a). 
 
Hopefully you are aware that when associations are sued, their insurance carriers raise 
premiums, or worse, no longer offer coverage. The language of this bill is playing into the hands 
of those companies, especially at a time when premiums are rising and legislators are seeking 
ways to stop this flow of money. 
The last sentence which shifts the burden of proof to the association should be deleted. 
Please defer this bill.

TESTIMONY FOR HB70 HD1 SD1 
 
For:  The Senate Committee on Judiciary (JDC) 
 
DATE: 
Tuesday, March 25, 2025 
TIME: 
10:01 AM 
PLACE: 
Conference Room 016 & 
Videoconference 
State Capitol 
415 South Beretania Street 
 
Aloha Chair Rhoads, Vice Chair Gabbard, and Members of the Committee, 
 
My name is Gregory Misakian and I have been advocating for the rights of 
condominium owners in Hawaii since 2021, when I realized how much misconduct 
and corruption there is within many condominium associations throughout 
Hawaii, in addition to misconduct and corruption within numerous large 
management companies that manage and oversee condominium associations, 
and misuse and abusive use of association attorneys against condominium 
owners. 
 
I currently serve as 1st Vice President of the Kokua Council, an elder advocacy 
organization in Hawaii since 1972, a Director at the Hawaii Alliance for Retired 
Americans, and a member of the Waikiki Neighborhood Board, where we have 
advocated for better consumer protections for condominium owners in a 
resolution adopted in 2023 (also adopted by other Neighborhood Boards). 
 
As many as 1/3 of the population of Hawaii lives in condominiums, including many 
legislators and their friends and families.  It has been shown with evidence to 
support, including many news stories and a great deal of testimony, that 
condominium owners are being subjected to abusive and predatory practices, 
often at the direction of the condominium association’s President and Board, with 
management company agents and association attorneys being willful participants.  
I also know this first-hand, because it’s happening at my condominium 
association, where I and others have been subjected to unlawful retaliation in 
violation of HRS 514B-191.  Our former Maintenance Manager was retaliated 

2 
 
against for simply raising valid concerns regarding serious building issues that 
needed to be addressed by the Board.  The Board President chose to suspend him 
without informing the Board, which is also a violation of our governing 
documents, as only the “Board” can make employment decisions.  And now there 
is a lawsuit against the association, which can be seen at eCourt Kokua – Antonio 
Vierra vs. Keoni Ana AOAO. 
 
This Board President is also a former Deputy Attorney General in Hawaii, and a 
former Corporation Counsel Attorney for the City and County of Honolulu. He is 
currently employed by our former association law firm (Kobayashi, Sugita & Goda 
LLC), and was working there before anyone on the Board or the association was 
even informed, and while they were still our association law firm.  Ultimately his 
actions have cost our association a substantial amount of money in legal expenses 
and other losses, and the future will only tell what is next regarding assessments 
and maintenance fees when the current litigation is concluded.  I anticipate more 
litigation and more harm to the association, due to his and other’s bad acts, which 
there are many of, including evidence of fraud, contract fraud, not obtaining 
permits for projects, and violating a Department of Planning and Permitting stop 
work order 3x in one week, with HPD called to take reports.  Abuse of power 
seems to be well established in condominium association Boards, but also seen in 
many other areas of leadership throughout Hawaii, including at the legislature. 
 
While I originally supported HB70 and its intentions, our legislators have carved 
out more from this bill since the last HD1 version, and deleted a very important 
section that was previously seen in two places. 
 
 (2)  Explicitly stating that the defense of good faith compliance is unavailable to 
any condominium association whose board adopts a budget that omits the 
required budget summary; and 
 
The defense of good faith shall be unavailable to an association whenever its 
board adopts a budget that omits the summary required by subsection (a)." 
 
And as I’ve previously testified, owners still have the burden to go to court for 
enforcement, which can be very costly.  The only real solution to address serious 

3 
 
issues within condominium associations and their proper management, is to have 
enforcement of the laws that you enact.    
 
Please read and support HB890 and SB1265 (companion bill) for an Ombudsman’s 
Office for Condominium Associations. 
 
HB890 - RELATING TO CONDOMINIUM ASSOCIATIONS. (Ombudsman) 
SB1265 - RELATING TO CONDOMINIUM ASSOCIATIONS. (Ombudsman) 
 
And also: 
 
HB1209 - RELATING TO CONDOMINIUM ASSOCIATIONS. (Attorneys’ Fees) 
HB1311 - RELATING TO CONDOMINIUM PROXY VOTING. 
HB1312 - RELATING TO ASSOCIATION MANAGERS. 
HB1313 - RELATING TO BOARD MEMBERS. 
HB1315 - RELATING TO PARLIAMENTARIANS. 
HB1447 - RELATING TO MANAGING AGENTS. 
SB1623 - RELATING TO MANAGING AGENTS. 
 
Sadly, as often is the case at the legislature, where some often work for campaign 
donations before they work for the people of Hawaii, none of these bills were 
scheduled.  It is not too late to take what is in these bills and amend some of the 
bills the Committee Chairs chose, which mostly do not provide the best solutions 
or enforceable solutions without condominium owners having to go to court.  The 
#1 goal is to help condominium owners so they do not have to go to court, and 
have a place to go where they are treated fairly, and where efficient and timely 
resolutions to issues and concerns can be administered (i.e., the Ombudsman’s 
Office for Condominium Associations).  
 
I also ask our legislators to provide a simple breakdown of what they think this 
section will cost condominium owners if they attempt to enforce it? 
 
Any unit owner shall have standing to bring an action alleging a violation of this 
section against an association that the unit owner is a member of, and may seek 
an injunction to enforce compliance with this section by the association’s 

4 
 
board.  The association shall have the burden of proving substantial compliance 
with this section in any such action.” 
 
Will there be a state fund to subsidize the legal costs that may run into the many 
thousands of dollars if an owner tried to bring an action alleging a violation?  Will 
you establish free legal counsel for those who can’t afford it (as you want to do for 
illegal aliens)?   
 
The people of Hawaii are counting on you to enact condominium consumer 
protection laws that help the residents of Hawaii, and not ones that just give the 
illusion of helping.  Your latest magic trick, to make an important section 
disappear that would have provided more consumer protections, just shows 
further how disconnected and disregarding some of our legislators are.   
 
Gregory Misakian 

Dear Senator Rhoads, Chair, Senator Gabbard, Vice Chair, and Members of the Committee: 
I OPPOSE H.B. No. 70, H.D.1., S.D.1.
The new subsection (g) provides that “[a]ny unit owner shall have standing to bring an action
alleging a violation of this section against an association that the unit owner is a member of, and
may seek an injunction to enforce compliance with this section by the association’s board. The
association shall have the burden of proving substantial compliance with this section in any such
action.” The last sentence which shifts the burden of proof to the association should be deleted. 
A party who brings an action should have the burden of proof. It is inconsistent with general
principles of law to shift the burden of proof entirely to the defendant. If an owner brings an
action alleging that an association has violated HRS Section 514B-148, the owner should be
required to put forth evidence of the violation. 
Respectfully submitted,
Pamela J. Schell

Testimony in Support of HB70 and Creation of an HOA Office 
For: The Committee on Judiciary (CPC) 
Date: March 25, 2025 Time:10:01 am HST 
Aloha Chair Senator Karl Rhoads, Vice Chair  Senator Mike Gabbard, and Members of the 
Committee, 
My name is Jessica Herzog, and I am a condominium owner and advocate for fair governance 
within condominium associations. As a former AOAO board Treasurer who has personally 
witnessed and been a victim of embezzlement, I write today to express my strong support for 
HB70, which aims to improve transparency and accountability within our condominium 
associations. I also urge the establishment of a State-run, Association-funded HOA Office to 
enforce these provisions effectively and propose an essential amendment to the current bill. 
During my tenure as Treasurer, I experienced firsthand the lack of accountability that boards and 
management companies exhibit regarding their fiduciary responsibilities. This negligence 
directly undermines the top priority of our role, which is to protect the funds and best interests of 
the association. This has led me to advocate strongly for changes that ensure more rigorous 
oversight and accountability. 
Proposed Amendment: To further strengthen HB70, I propose an amendment that all financial 
work required for an AOAO's annual financial report must be performed by a licensed 
accountant, independent of the management company. This amendment is vital to prevent 
conflicts of interest and ensure accurate, unbiased financial reporting. Currently, management 
companies often handle these reports internally, claiming oversight by a single accountant for 
numerous properties, which can lead to discrepancies and a lack of transparency. 
The creation of an HOA Office, funded by the associations themselves, is crucial. This office 
would serve as a neutral and authoritative body capable of overseeing compliance with state 
condominium laws, mediating disputes, and ensuring that financial reports are handled 
appropriately and transparently. 

In conclusion, while I support HB70 and its intentions, these experiences and observations 
compel me to emphasize the need for the suggested changes and the establishment of an HOA 
Office. This office would not only enforce legislative changes but also provide real protection, 
recourse, and a balanced mediation avenue for condominium owners, ensuring that the 
nightmares I experienced do not recur for others. 
Thank you for considering my testimony. I urge the committee to support the enactment of HB70 
along with the necessary amendments to establish a State-run HOA Office and require 
independent, licensed accountants for financial reporting within AOAOs.

Dear Senator Rhoads, Chair, Senator Gabbard, Vice Chair, and Members of the Committee: 
I am a condominium unit owner in Hawaii and I OPPOSE H.B. No. 70, H.D.1., S.D.1. 
I oppose this measure because it will impose a burden of proof on an association when another 
unit owner brings an action against the association alleging a violation of HRS Section 514B-
148. The sentence imposing a burden of proof on associations in such actions (page 5, line 21, 
through page 6, line 2) should be deleted.  
A party who brings an action should have the burden of proof (by presenting evidence that shows 
their claim meets certain requirements), and a defendant should be given the opportunity to 
respond to the allegations.  It is inconsistent with general principles of law to shift the burden of 
proof entirely to the defendant.  
Respectfully submitted, 
Paul A. Ireland Koftinow
