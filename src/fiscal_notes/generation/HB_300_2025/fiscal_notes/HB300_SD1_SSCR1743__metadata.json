The measure does not introduce new general revenue sources but supports programs that leverage other funds; for instance, the Department of Human Services notes that general fund additions for federally funded programs will allow access to approximately $58.89M (HB300_HD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-18-25_.PDF.txt) in additional federal matching funds in FY2026 (HB300_HD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-18-25_.PDF.txt).\",\n  \"capital_expenditure_impact\": \"The Senate Draft's capital improvement budget appropriates $1,556,332,000 (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt) in fiscal year 2025-2026 and $339,507,000 (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt) in fiscal year 2026-2027 in general obligation bond funds (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt). In total, it appropriates $3,722,213,000 (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt) in all means of financing for FY 2026 and $2,047,775,000 (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt) for FY 2027 (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt). Highlights include $195,000,000 (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt) for Department of Education building improvements, $193,802,000 (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt) in FY26 for affordable housing projects, and $190,500,000 (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt) in FY26 for University of Hawaii student housing solutions (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt).\",\n  \"fiscal_implications_after_6_years\": \"The State faces long-term fiscal obligations from capital projects funded by bonds, which will require debt service payments for many years. Many of the operating budget appropriations are for recurring costs for positions and programs, such as teacher differentials and homeless services, which are expected to continue beyond the six-year planning horizon. The Council on Revenues' forecast, extending to fiscal year 2031, provides a longer-term outlook on the State's revenue capacity to meet these ongoing commitments (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt).\",\n  \"updates_from_previous_fiscal_note\": \"This fiscal note is based on the Senate Draft 1 (SD1) of HB 300, which introduces significant changes from the previous House Draft 1 (HD1). The SD1 operating budget is lower, appropriating $19,930,242,350 (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt) in all funds for FY26, compared to the HD1's $20,484,862,473. The SD1 reflects the Senate's priorities, including strategic investments in education, housing, and agriculture, and restores several key appropriations that were reduced in the HD1, such as $2,000,000 (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt) for irrigation systems, a $49,500,000 (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt) special fund ceiling for the New Aloha Stadium Entertainment District, $465,000 (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt) for Charter School teacher differentials, and $876,000 (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt) for the Office of Wellness and Resilience's State of Well-Being Project (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt). A major policy shift is the Senate's decision to cash-fund $262,200,000 (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt) in capital improvement projects to stimulate the economy, instead of depositing funds into the emergency and budget reserve fund as the HD1 proposed, citing the Governor's previous vetoes of such deposits (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt). Additionally, the SD1 implements more aggressive reductions for long-term vacant positions, resulting in nearly $15,000,000 (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt) in general-fund savings annually (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt).\"\n}"
