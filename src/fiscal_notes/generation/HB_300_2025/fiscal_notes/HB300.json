  "overview": "The purpose and intent of this measure is to appropriate funds for the operating and capital improvement budget of the executive branch for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027 (HB300). This measure, as introduced, includes the base budget from Act 164, Session Laws of Hawaii 2023, as amended by Act 230, Session Laws of Hawaii 2024, previously appropriated collective bargaining amounts, and adjustments for retirement, health, debt service, and Medicaid requirements (HB300). Following the latest downward forecast from the Council on Revenues, the Senate has adopted a budget that maintains essential services for the State's most vulnerable populations and proactively expands the economy through strategic investments in emerging sectors (HB300).",
  "appropriations": "The Senate Draft's capital improvement budget appropriates $1,556,332,000 (HB300) in fiscal year 2025-2026 and $339,507,000 (HB300) in fiscal year 2026-2027 in general obligation bond funds (HB300). The total operating budget in the Senate Draft (SD1) is $19,930,242,350 (HB300) in all funds for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $19,735,840,017 (HB300) for fiscal year 2026-2027 (HB300). Specific appropriations include adding $465,000 (HB300) in FY26 and FY27 for differentials for Charter Schools teachers and $2,000,000 (HB300) in FY26 to supplement the revolving fund to keep irrigation water rates affordable (HB300).",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The budget formulation includes several components: \"The base budget from Act 164, Session Laws of Hawaii 2023, as amended by Act 230, Session Laws of Hawaii 2024 (HB300),\" \"Previously appropriated collective bargaining amounts from prior acts (HB300),\" and \"Adjustments necessary to fulfill the Employee's Retirement System, Employer-Union Health Benefits Trust Fund, debt service, and Medicaid requirements for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027 (HB300).\" The Senate amended the measure to \"reduce positions vacant since July 1, 2020 (HB300),\" using updated lists from departments and data from Budget Journal Tables (HB300). Projections are also informed by the Council on Revenues' March 12, 2025, forecast for general fund revenue growth (HB300).",
  "agency_impact": "The budget has significant impacts on various agencies, with the Senate draft restoring funds to prevent negative consequences. For the Hawaii Community Development Authority, failure to secure a proposed $100,000 (HB300) general fund appropriation for its ninety-nine year leasehold program \"would result in a reduction in force and force one person into unemployment (HB300).\" Similarly, the Office of Wellness and Resilience indicated that without the proposed $876,000 (HB300) general fund appropriation, it could not execute critical deliverables and six filled positions would face a reduction in force (HB300). The Department of Agriculture testified that failing to secure a $2,000,000 (HB300) appropriation would cause irrigation costs to more than double, rising from $0.50 (HB300) to $1.11 (HB300) per 1,000 gallons (HB300).",
  "economic_impact": "The budget aims for a near-term economic stimulus through strategic use of funds for capital improvement projects, as \"Cash-funded capital improvement projects boost the construction industry (HB300).\" In response to a downward revenue forecast, the budget seeks to proactively expand the economy through strategic investments in emerging sectors such as agricultural innovation (HB300). For example, a recommended appropriation of $2,000,000 (HB300) for irrigation systems is intended to keep water rates affordable for local farmers and support agricultural production, as failure to provide these funds would result in a \"significant cost increase (HB300)\" for farmers (HB300).",
  "policy_impact": "This measure advances the Senate Majority's priorities for the 2025 Regular Session, including education, housing, environmental sustainability, and agricultural innovation (HB300). The Senate draft amends the budget by \"changing means of financing from general obligation bond funds to general funds for certain capital improvement programs (HB300),\" a policy intended to provide a \"near-term stimulus for the economy while ensuring longâ€‘term flexibility in the face of fiscal uncertainty (HB300).\" Furthermore, the budget implements the policy set forth in Finance Memorandum No. 24-10 to \"reduce positions vacant since July 1, 2020 (HB300),\" resulting in significant savings across all means of financing (HB300).",
  "revenue_sources": "Funding for the budget is derived from general funds, special funds, general obligation bond funds, and federal funds (HB300). The Council on Revenues lowered its forecast for general fund tax revenues, projecting a decrease in revenues of $213,280,000 (HB300) for fiscal year 2025-2026 (HB300). The Governor's proposed budget included federal funding of $3,875,555,199 (HB300) for operating costs in fiscal year 2025-2026 and $3,839,750,906 (HB300) in fiscal year 2026-2027 (HB300).",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The six-year fiscal outlook is marked by significant obligations and revenue uncertainty. The Council on Revenues' revised forecast indicates a cumulative decrease in revenues totaling $1,461,640,000 (HB300) through fiscal year 2030-2031 (HB300). The State faces fixed costs for debt service, health benefits, and retirement benefits totaling $3,818,382,855 (HB300) for FY 2025-2026 and $3,909,959,813 (HB300) for FY 2026-2027 (HB300). Additionally, there are obligations for the Maui wildfire settlement amounting to $400,000,000 (HB300) for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $407,500,000 (HB300) for fiscal year 2026-2027 (HB300). Collective bargaining agreements add another $135,246,478 (HB300) in general funds for FY 2025-2026 and $161,185,454 (HB300) for FY 2026-2027 (HB300). To maintain flexibility, the Senate Committee funded \"most new programs to allow for fiscal flexibility (HB300)\" in fiscal year 2025-2026 only (HB300). The Committee also set aside $262,200,000 (HB300) in general funds for capital improvement projects as a near-term stimulus (HB300). Reductions from long-term vacant positions are expected to generate nearly $15,000,000 (HB300) in general-fund savings for each of fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027 (HB300). Across all financing means, these reductions are projected to save nearly $50,000,000 (HB300) annually (HB300).",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The Council on Revenues lowered its general fund revenue forecast on March 12, 2025, projecting a decrease in revenues by $133,956,000 (HB300) for fiscal year 2024-2025 and $213,280,000 (HB300) for fiscal year 2025-2026 (HB300). This downward revision was attributed to \"unexpected increases in individual and corporate tax refunds\" and a \"non-recurring estate tax collection in the previous fiscal year (HB300).\" The forecast for general fund tax revenues for fiscal year 2026 projects a contraction, with revenues of $9,820,678,000 (HB300), a 2.3% decrease from the prior year (HB300).",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The Senate Draft's capital improvement budget appropriates $1,556,332,000 (HB300) in fiscal year 2025-2026 and $339,507,000 (HB300) in fiscal year 2026-2027 in general obligation bond funds (HB300). Highlights of the capital budget include $195,000,000 (HB300) for Department of Education building improvements, repair, and maintenance; $193,802,000 (HB300) in FY26 for various affordable housing and infrastructure projects; and $52,000,000 (HB300) in FY26 for repair and maintenance for the Hawaii Convention Center (HB300). To provide a near-term economic stimulus, the Committee has also set aside general funds in the amount of $262,200,000 (HB300) for capital improvement projects (HB300).",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "Beyond the six-year forecast period, the State will continue to face ongoing fiscal obligations, primarily the need to fulfill requirements for the \"Employee's Retirement System, Employer-Union Health Benefits Trust Fund, debt service, and Medicaid (HB300).\" The Council on Revenues' forecast extends through fiscal year 2030-2031, showing projected revenue growth, but these projections are lower than previously anticipated and subject to change (HB300). Long-term fiscal stability will depend on managing these significant fixed costs against actual revenue performance and navigating potential shifts in federal funding and economic conditions (HB300).",
