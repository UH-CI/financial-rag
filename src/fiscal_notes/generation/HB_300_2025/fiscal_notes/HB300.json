  "overview": "This measure, HB 300 H.D. 1, appropriates funds for the operating and capital improvement costs of the Executive Branch for the fiscal biennium 2025-2027. It outlines the state budget, allocating resources to various government departments and programs. The committee's amendments focus on funding core and safety net programs to address economic uncertainties.",
  "appropriations": "The measure appropriates from General Funds $10,668,359,711 for fiscal year 2026 and $10,519,050,655 for fiscal year 2027 for operating expenses. For capital improvements, it appropriates from General Obligation Bonds $1,453,490,000 for fiscal year 2026 and $446,559,000 for fiscal year 2027. Specific allocations include funds for the Emergency and Budget Reserve Fund, summer school, healthcare services, housing programs, and increased provider payment rates.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal projections are based on the State's economic outlook, which anticipates moderate growth but faces challenges from inflation, a shrinking labor force, and potential federal spending cuts. The methodology involved prioritizing core and safety net programs to ensure flexibility and stability in the budget. Data sources include briefings from the State Economist and economic forecasts from the University of Hawaii Economic Research Organization (UHERO).",
  "agency_impact": "This measure has a comprehensive impact on all Executive Branch agencies by establishing their operating and capital improvement budgets for the 2025-2027 biennium. It directly affects agency operations, staffing levels, and resource allocation, as evidenced by the extensive list of departments that provided testimony. For example, it specifically adds five positions and funding for the Office of Federal Awards Management to address potential changes in federal policy.",
  "economic_impact": "The budget aims to mitigate potential negative economic effects, such as a recession forecasted by UHERO due to federal disruptions and job losses. By investing in safety net programs like housing assistance and healthcare, the measure provides economic support to residents. These appropriations are intended to stimulate the local economy and support key sectors like healthcare and education during a period of economic uncertainty.",
  "policy_impact": "As the state's primary budget bill, this measure is a key policy implementation tool that adjusts funding levels for all executive programs to reflect legislative priorities. The committee's focus on strengthening core services and safety net programs demonstrates a policy strategy aimed at building economic resilience. This legislation modifies existing program funding to address pressing issues such as healthcare access, housing instability, and potential reductions in federal aid.",
  "revenue_sources": "The primary revenue sources identified in the measure to support the appropriations are General Funds, which are derived from state taxes and other general revenues. Additionally, the capital improvement projects are funded through the issuance of General Obligation Bonds. The 'All Means of Finance' totals encompass these sources along with other unspecified federal funds, special funds, and trust funds.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The provided document details fiscal implications only for the 2025-2027 biennium and does not offer a six-year projection. However, the appropriations signal ongoing commitments. Recurring annual expenses for fiscal years 2026 and 2027 include $20.99 million for summer school, $13 million for Hawaii State Hospital contracts, $3.75 million for the Housing First Program, and $29.46 million to sustain medical reimbursement rates. The addition of twenty-one permanent positions for community behavioral health clinics at a cost of $1.8 million in FY26 and $3.3 million in FY27 implies a long-term salary and benefit obligation. Many of the funded initiatives, particularly in healthcare and housing, represent core state services. These programs will likely require sustained or increased funding in subsequent fiscal years to maintain service levels. Therefore, these costs are expected to continue beyond the current biennium, forming a baseline for future budgets.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The provided document focuses entirely on appropriations and expenditures for the Executive Branch. It does not contain any provisions that are expected to directly increase, decrease, or otherwise alter the state's operating revenue streams. Therefore, no impact on operating revenues is anticipated from this measure as written.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The measure outlines significant capital expenditures for the Executive Branch over the biennium. It appropriates $3,628,285,000 in FY 2026 and $2,369,450,000 in FY 2027 from all means of financing for capital improvement projects. A substantial portion of this funding comes from General Obligation Bonds, totaling $1,453,490,000 in FY 2026 and $446,559,000 in FY 2027.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "While the document does not project fiscal implications beyond the 2025-2027 biennium, the nature of the funded programs suggests ongoing fiscal obligations. The creation of permanent positions and funding for essential services like healthcare, behavioral health, and housing assistance indicate a long-term commitment. These programs will likely require continued state funding to operate, representing sustained annual costs for the state well beyond the six-year mark.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "This fiscal note reflects the Committee on Finance's amendments to the administration's revised budget proposal. The main updates include changes to overall appropriation totals. For operating expenses from General Funds, the committee increased the FY26 appropriation from approximately $10.52 billion to $10.67 billion and decreased the FY27 appropriation from $10.57 billion to $10.52 billion. For capital improvements funded by General Obligation Bonds, the committee increased the FY26 amount from $1.37 billion to $1.45 billion and decreased the FY27 amount from $601.2 million to $446.6 million."
