  "appropriations": "The Senate Draft of the bill appropriates total operating funds of $19,930,242,350 (HB300) for fiscal year 2025-2026, which includes $10,436,542,543 (HB300) in general funds. For fiscal year 2026-2027, total operating appropriations are $19,735,840,017 (HB300), with $10,421,715,049 (HB300) from general funds. The Capital Improvements Program budget includes $3,722,213,000 (HB300) in fiscal year 2025-2026 and $2,047,775,000 (HB300) in fiscal year 2026-2027 across all funding sources.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The budget is built upon the base budget from Act 164, Session Laws of Hawaii 2023, and incorporates adjustments for debt service, retirement benefits, and health fund obligations. Projections are informed by the Council on Revenues' March 12, 2025 forecast, which projected decreased revenues of $213,280,000 (HB300) for FY26 and $218,612,000 (HB300) for FY27. The Senate's methodology also involved reducing long-term vacant positions based on Finance Memorandum No. 24-10 and departmental vacancy lists, resulting in significant savings.",
  "agency_impact": "The measure impacts state agencies by funding their operations while also implementing fiscal constraints, such as the reduction of over 500.00 (HB300) permanent and 150.00 (HB300) temporary vacant positions, resulting in savings of nearly $50,000,000 (HB300) across all funds. Concurrently, it allocates funding for new positions in priority areas, including 58.00 positions (HB300) for the Ready Keiki initiative and 44.00 positions (HB300) for biosecurity. These adjustments will require agencies to manage resources carefully to meet service delivery mandates.",
  "economic_impact": "This measure is expected to stimulate the state's economy by allocating $262,200,000 (HB300) in general funds for cash-funded capital improvement projects, boosting the construction industry. It supports the agricultural sector by appropriating $2,000,000 (HB300) to keep irrigation water rates affordable, which helps maintain local food production. Investments in housing, workforce development, and strategic industries are intended to foster long-term economic resilience and mitigate risks from potential federal funding cuts.",
  "policy_impact": "This budget operationalizes the Legislature's policy priorities by funding initiatives in education, housing, environmental sustainability, and agricultural innovation. It provides resources for programs established by previous legislation, such as Act 97's ninety-nine year leasehold program and Act 106's State of Well-Being Project. The measure reflects a policy of fiscal caution by funding most new programs for only one year, allowing for future flexibility in response to economic uncertainties.",
  "revenue_sources": "The budget is primarily supported by the state's general fund, which is financed through tax revenues. It also relies significantly on federal funds, with the Governor's proposal including $3,875,555,199 (HB300) for operating costs in fiscal year 2025-2026 and $3,839,750,906 (HB300) in fiscal year 2026-2027. Capital improvement projects are funded through a combination of general funds, general obligation bond funds totaling $1,556,332,000 (HB300) in FY26 and $339,507,000 (HB300) in FY27, and various special funds.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The bill provides a two-year fiscal plan, with general fund appropriations of $10,436,542,543 (HB300) for FY26 and $10,421,715,049 (HB300) for FY27. Beyond this period, the state faces significant fixed costs for debt service, health benefits, and retirement, totaling $3,818,382,855 (HB300) in FY26 and $3,909,959,813 (HB300) in FY27. The state must also manage a Maui wildfire settlement obligation of $400,000,000 (HB300) for FY26 and $407,500,000 (HB300) for FY27. Collective bargaining costs add another $135,246,478 (HB300) in general funds for FY26 and $161,185,454 (HB300) for FY27. The Council on Revenues' long-term forecast projects modest revenue growth after an initial decline, with an estimated revenue of $10,105,506,000 (HB300) in FY27 and $10,358,144,000 (HB300) in FY28. The long-term outlook will be shaped by the state's ability to manage these escalating fixed costs against revenue performance. The Senate's strategy of funding most new programs for only fiscal year 2025-2026 is intended to provide fiscal flexibility in future years. This cautious approach acknowledges the potential for economic downturns and changes in federal policy. The budget's sustainability will depend on continued economic stability and prudent fiscal management in subsequent legislative sessions.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "This measure does not directly generate operating revenue; instead, it appropriates funds based on projected revenues. The budget is significantly influenced by the Council on Revenues' downward forecast, which anticipates a general fund revenue decrease of $133,956,000 (HB300) in FY25 and $213,280,000 (HB300) in FY26. This reduction in anticipated revenue has constrained the state's spending capacity and informed the fiscally cautious approach taken in this budget.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The measure authorizes significant capital expenditures, with total appropriations of $3,722,213,000 (HB300) in fiscal year 2025-2026 and $2,047,775,000 (HB300) in fiscal year 2026-2027. Key investments include $195,000,000 (HB300) for Department of Education building improvements and $193,802,000 (HB300) in FY26 for affordable housing projects. These expenditures are intended to address deferred maintenance, modernize state assets, and stimulate economic activity through construction.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "Beyond the six-year forecast horizon, the state will face ongoing fiscal obligations for established programs and rising fixed costs for debt service, pensions, and healthcare benefits. The Council on Revenues projects general fund tax revenues to reach $11,165,089,000 (HB300) by fiscal year 2031, indicating a need for sustained economic growth to support these long-term commitments. The long-term fiscal health will depend on future policy decisions, economic performance, and the sustainability of program funding established in this and subsequent budgets.",
