  "overview": "House Bill 300, Conference Draft 1, serves as the General Appropriations Act of 2025, finalizing the state's executive branch budget for the fiscal biennium from July 1, 2025, to June 30, 2027. This measure appropriates funds for all operating expenses and capital improvement projects for state departments. As the final version of the budget, it incorporates negotiated priorities from both legislative chambers, including funding for critical government services, departmental operational needs, and specific community grants-in-aid.",
  "appropriations": "The budget appropriates from all financing sources $19.94 billion for fiscal year 2026 and $19.76 billion for fiscal year 2027. This includes general fund appropriations of $10.59 billion in FY26 and $10.64 billion in FY27. Major allocations are directed towards deferred maintenance in public schools, operational support for the Hawaii Health Systems Corporation, biosecurity enhancements at the Department of Agriculture, and public safety initiatives within the Department of Law Enforcement.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "Financial projections are based on the Council on Revenues' March 2025 forecast, which anticipated a 5.0% revenue growth for FY25 followed by a -2.25% contraction in FY26. The budget was developed by incorporating approved executive branch requests for funding adjustments, position changes, and transfers between financing means. The final appropriations reflect a conference committee agreement that balanced these requests with legislative priorities, adding funds for critical services and specific departmental programs as detailed in the conference committee report.",
  "agency_impact": "This measure has a significant operational and budgetary impact on state agencies by providing targeted funding increases for key priorities. The Department of Education receives substantial funds for deferred maintenance, athletics, and school security, while the Department of Health is allocated significant resources for state hospitals and emergency medical services. The budget also expands capacity in other departments, providing 44 new positions for biosecurity at the Department of Agriculture and 21 positions for the DOCARE Academy at the Department of Land and Natural Resources.",
  "economic_impact": "The budget is expected to have a significant economic impact through its authorization of over $5.7 billion in capital improvement projects over the biennium, stimulating the construction industry and creating jobs. Specific appropriations, such as the Manufacturing Assistance Program and grants for agricultural development, aim to support local industries and foster economic diversification. Additionally, grant-in-aid appropriations totaling $10 million in FY26 will provide direct support to various non-profit organizations, enhancing community services and local economies across the state.",
  "policy_impact": "This Act codifies the legislature's policy priorities by allocating substantial financial resources to specific initiatives. Key policy impacts include expanding early childhood education with funding for 108 new pre-kindergarten positions, enhancing public safety through targeted funds for a fireworks enforcement section and gun buyback program, and addressing healthcare needs with appropriations for the Healthcare Education Loan Repayment Program. The budget modifies agency operations by funding IT modernization projects, such as the Enterprise Financial System and cybersecurity upgrades, to improve government efficiency and service delivery.",
  "revenue_sources": "The budget is primarily funded by state general fund tax revenues, as projected by the Council on Revenues in its March 2025 forecast. Additional significant revenue sources include special funds generated by user fees from agencies like the Department of Transportation's airports and harbors divisions. Federal funds are a major component, supporting programs in the Department of Human Services and the Department of Health, while general obligation bonds are the primary source for most capital improvement projects.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The budget establishes significant long-term fiscal commitments, primarily through the authorization of approximately $1.85 billion in general obligation bonds for capital projects, which will create debt service obligations for the next two decades. The addition of numerous permanent positions, including 108 for early learning and 44 for biosecurity, will result in recurring personnel costs that are expected to increase with future collective bargaining agreements. The Council on Revenues' forecast of a revenue decline in fiscal year 2026, followed by modest growth, highlights the need for prudent fiscal management to sustain these new and existing programs. Many capital projects, such as IT system modernizations and facility upgrades, will likely require ongoing maintenance funding in future budget cycles. The budget funds fixed costs for debt service and employee benefits, which are projected to consume a significant portion of general fund revenues. The fiscal strategy relies on future revenue growth to meet these expanded operating and debt service commitments beyond the current biennium.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "This measure does not introduce new taxes or fees and therefore has no direct impact on increasing state operating revenues. However, it allocates funds to programs intended to stimulate economic growth, such as the Manufacturing Assistance Program and tourism marketing, which are expected to indirectly support future growth in general excise and income tax collections. The budget appropriates existing revenues from general funds, special funds, and federal grants to support state operations.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The measure authorizes total capital expenditures of $3.38 billion in fiscal year 2026 and $2.33 billion in fiscal year 2027 from all funding sources, including general obligation bonds, revenue bonds, and federal funds. Key capital investments include $1.43 billion in general obligation bonds for FY26 for projects such as public school deferred maintenance, university facility upgrades, and improvements to state hospitals. Specific major projects funded include $150 million for DOE deferred maintenance, over $100 million for affordable rental housing funds, and significant investments in airport and harbor modernization.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "Beyond the six-year planning horizon, the state will be responsible for ongoing debt service payments for the nearly $1.85 billion in general obligation bonds authorized in this budget. The hundreds of new permanent positions created will represent a permanent increase in the state's operating baseline, requiring sustained funding from future revenues. The long-term viability of the expanded programs and services will depend on the state's ability to achieve consistent economic growth to support these recurring costs.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The final Conference Draft 1 increases operating appropriations compared to the Senate Draft 1, with general fund totals rising from $10.44 billion to $10.59 billion in FY26 and from $10.42 billion to $10.64 billion in FY27. Capital improvement authorizations via general obligation bonds are similar in total ($1.85 billion in CD1 vs $1.89 billion in SD1), but the final version no longer emphasizes the use of general fund cash for CIP, instead relying on traditional bond financing. Programmatically, this final version adds significant new funding not detailed in the previous note, including over $280 million for various Hawaii Health Systems Corporation regions, $10 million for the Department of Education's Safer Watch Program, $5.2 million for a new Fireworks Enforcement Section, and major investments in state IT infrastructure, reflecting the final negotiated priorities of both the House and Senate."
