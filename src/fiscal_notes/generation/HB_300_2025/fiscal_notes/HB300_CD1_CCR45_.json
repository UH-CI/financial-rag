It incorporates approved executive requests and provides additional funding for critical government services, reflecting a compromise on legislative priorities. The budget focuses on areas such as education, biosecurity, healthcare, and public safety.",

Major operating appropriations include $150,000,000 (HB300_CD1_CCR45_) for Department of Education deferred maintenance, $248,257,800 (HB300_CD1_CCR45_) for Hawaii Health Systems Corporations regions, and $26,649,462 (HB300_CD1_CCR45_) for biosecurity. Capital improvement appropriations total $3,379,551,000 (HB300_CD1_CCR45_) for FY 2025-2026 and $2,331,259,000 (HB300_CD1_CCR45_) for FY 2026-2027.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "Financial projections are based on the Council on Revenues' March 2025 general fund forecast, which projected a 5.0% (HB300_CD1_CCR45_) revenue growth for fiscal year 2025 followed by a decrease of -2.25% (HB300_CD1_CCR45_) for fiscal year 2026. The budget was developed by incorporating executive requests for trade-offs and transfers, and adding funding for legislative priorities identified during conference committee deliberations. Cost estimations for new initiatives and capital projects are based on departmental requests and historical data.",
  "agency_impact": "The measure provides significant funding increases to several departments to address critical needs. The Department of Education receives $150,000,000 (HB300_CD1_CCR45_) for deferred maintenance and over $30,000,000 (HB300_CD1_CCR45_) for electricity costs, while the Department of Health receives substantial support for the Hawaii Health Systems Corporations, including $248,257,800 (HB300_CD1_CCR45_) for its regional systems. The Department of Agriculture is allocated an additional 44.00 positions and $26,649,462 (HB300_CD1_CCR45_) to enhance biosecurity efforts statewide.",
  "economic_impact": "The budget aims to stimulate the economy through significant capital improvement investments, including $1,428,063,000 (HB300_CD1_CCR45_) in General Obligation Bonds for FY 2025-2026. It supports workforce development with funding for programs such as the $2,000,000 (HB300_CD1_CCR45_) Manufacturing Assistance Program and the $2,000,000 (HB300_CD1_CCR45_) Hawaii Small Business Innovation Research Program. Additionally, the measure includes $10,000,000 (HB300_CD1) in grants-in-aid for various non-profit organizations providing community services.",
  "policy_impact": "This measure finalizes the state's fiscal policy for the biennium, balancing executive requests with legislative priorities for critical government services. It amends prior appropriations, such as repurposing a facility in Kihei for teacher and workforce housing instead of preschools (HB300_CD1). The act also establishes new funding priorities, such as adding $5,234,951 (HB300_CD1_CCR45_) and 8.00 positions (HB300_CD1_CCR45_) for a Fireworks Enforcement Section within the Department of Law Enforcement.",
  "revenue_sources": "The budget is primarily funded by general funds, which are based on the Council on Revenues' March 2025 forecast projecting $10,046,729,000 (HB300_CD1_CCR45_) in tax revenues for FY 2025. Other major funding sources include federal funds, special funds, and trust funds for operating expenses. Capital improvement projects are financed mainly through the issuance of $1,428,063,000 (HB300_CD1_CCR45_) in General Obligation Bonds and $1,446,193,000 (HB300_CD1) in Revenue Bonds for FY 2025-2026.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The budget establishes significant ongoing financial commitments, with operating appropriations from general funds set at $10,593,637,391 (HB300_CD1_CCR45_) for FY 2026 and $10,637,871,235 (HB300_CD1_CCR45_) for FY 2027. The Council on Revenues projects modest general fund growth of 2.9% (HB300_CD1_CCR45_) in FY 2027, followed by rates between 1.9% (HB300_CD1_CCR45_) and 3.1% (HB300_CD1_CCR45_) through FY 2031. Major new recurring costs include salary increases, such as $3,307,382 (HB300_CD1_CCR45_) for Deputy Public Defenders, and expanded programs like the 108.00 positions (HB300_CD1_CCR45_) for public pre-kindergarten expansion. The issuance of over $1.8 billion (HB300_CD1_CCR45_) in new General Obligation bonds across the biennium will increase future debt service payments, which are projected to be $668,429,515 (HB300_CD1) in FY 2026 and $605,294,407 (HB300_CD1) in FY 2027 for non-DOE/UH debt service. Sustaining new initiatives, such as enhanced biosecurity and expanded healthcare services, will require continued revenue growth or budget reprioritization in future fiscal periods. The budget also includes large one-time investments like $150,000,000 (HB300_CD1_CCR45_) for deferred maintenance at DOE, which addresses a backlog but does not eliminate future needs.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "This appropriations measure does not include provisions that are expected to directly impact or change state operating revenues. The budget is formulated based on the Council on Revenues' March 2025 forecast, which projects a general fund revenue decrease of -2.25% (HB300_CD1_CCR45_) for fiscal year 2026. This reflects heightened economic uncertainty and policy changes at the federal level.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "This measure authorizes total capital improvement project appropriations of $3,379,551,000 (HB300_CD1_CCR45_) for FY 2025-2026 and $2,331,259,000 (HB300_CD1_CCR45_) for FY 2026-2027. For FY 2025-2026, this includes $1,428,063,000 (HB300_CD1_CCR45_) in General Obligation Bonds and $1,446,193,000 (HB300_CD1) in Revenue Bonds. Major capital investments include $100,000,000 (HB300_CD1) for the Rental Housing Revolving Fund, $323,300,000 (HB300_CD1) for Department of Education school projects, and significant funding for transportation infrastructure.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The budget creates long-term fiscal obligations through increased debt service from the issuance of over $1.8 billion (HB300_CD1_CCR45_) in General Obligation Bonds. Ongoing operating costs for newly established programs and the more than 240 new positions funded in the conference draft will become part of the State's base budget. Sustaining these expanded services in healthcare, education, and public safety will depend on future revenue performance aligning with or exceeding the modest growth rates projected by the Council on Revenues beyond the biennium.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The final conference draft (CD1) increases general fund operating appropriations compared to the Senate Draft 1 (SD1), adding approximately $157,000,000 in FY26 and $216,000,000 in FY27 for legislative priorities. A major policy shift from the SD1 is the abandonment of using $262,200,000 from the previous fiscal note in general fund cash for capital projects; the CD1 returns to traditional financing, primarily utilizing General Obligation Bonds, which total $1,428,063,000 (HB300_CD1_CCR45_) in FY26, a decrease from the SD1's $1,556,332,000 from the previous fiscal note. The CD1 also funds numerous specific additions not highlighted in the previous note, including $150,000,000 (HB300_CD1_CCR45_) for DOE deferred maintenance, $248,257,800 (HB300_CD1_CCR45_) for HHSC regional systems, and a $450,000,000 (HB300_CD1_CCR45_) appropriation for the Hospital Sustainability Special Fund. The aggressive reduction of over 500 vacant positions mentioned in the SD1 note is not a stated priority in the final version, which instead focuses on adding positions for critical services."
