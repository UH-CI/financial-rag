  "overview": "This measure appropriates funds for the executive branch's operating and capital improvement budget for fiscal biennium 2025-2027, as amended by the Senate Committee on Ways and Means. This version of the bill reflects Senate Majority priorities, including strategic investments in education, housing, and environmental sustainability, while addressing economic uncertainty through more aggressive reductions of long-term vacant positions. A key change is the rejection of a deposit into the emergency reserve fund in favor of using general funds for cash-funded capital improvement projects as an economic stimulus.",
  "appropriations": "The Senate Draft 1 of the bill reduces total operating appropriations to $19,930,242,350 (HB300_SD1) for fiscal year 2025-2026, with general funds of $10,436,542,543 (HB300_SD1). For fiscal year 2026-2027, appropriations are reduced to $19,735,840,017 (HB300_SD1), with general funds of $10,421,715,049 (HB300_SD1). New strategic appropriations include adding $15,000,000 (HB300_SD1) in each fiscal year for the Healthcare Education Loan Repayment Program and adding 44.00 positions and $13,324,731 (HB300_SD1) for biosecurity.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The budget is based on the Council on Revenues' lower forecast from March 12, 2025 (HB300_SD1), which projects reduced revenues due to increased tax refunds and federal policy uncertainty. A significant change in methodology is the rejection of the House's proposed $200,000,000 (HB300_HD1_HSCR1172_) deposit into the emergency and budget reserve fund, citing the Governor's past vetoes of similar large deposits of $300,000,000 (HB300_SD1) and $500,000,000 (HB300_SD1). Instead, the Senate draft sets aside $262,200,000 (HB300_SD1) in general funds for cash-funded capital projects to stimulate the economy and implements more aggressive reductions of long-term vacant positions based on updated lists from March 2025.",
  "agency_impact": "This measure significantly impacts state agencies through an aggressive reduction of positions that have been vacant since July 1, 2020, totaling over 500.00 permanent and 150.00 temporary positions across all means of financing (HB300_SD1). Conversely, it restores funding for certain agencies that were reduced in the House draft, including restoring 6.00 positions and $876,000 (HB300_SD1) for the Office of Wellness and Resilience's State of Well-Being Project. It also restores 1.00 position and $100,000 (HB300_SD1) for the Hawaii Community Development Authority's ninety-nine-year leasehold program, preventing a reduction in force.",
  "economic_impact": "The economic stimulus strategy has been revised to directly boost the construction industry by appropriating $262,200,000 (HB300_SD1) in general funds for cash-funded capital improvement projects. To support economic resilience, the measure restores a $49,500,000 (HB300_SD1) special fund ceiling increase for the New Aloha Stadium Entertainment District to prevent project delays. Furthermore, it supports local agriculture by restoring a $2,000,000 (HB300_SD1) general fund appropriation to keep irrigation water rates affordable for farmers.",
  "policy_impact": "This draft introduces several new policy approaches, including funding most new programs for fiscal year 2025-2026 only to maintain future fiscal flexibility. It establishes a policy of using general fund cash appropriations for a significant portion of capital improvement projects as a direct economic stimulus. The rejection of the deposit into the emergency reserve fund signals a policy shift in fiscal strategy, directly addressing the Governor's previous veto actions on similar legislative appropriations.",
  "revenue_sources": "The budget is based on the Council on Revenues' lower March 12, 2025 forecast, which projects a decrease in general fund tax revenues of $213,280,000 (HB300_SD1) for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $218,612,000 (HB300_SD1) for fiscal year 2026-2027. The funding mix for capital improvements has been altered to include a significant cash component, with $262,200,000 (HB300_SD1) from general funds. General Obligation Bond appropriations for capital projects are now $1,556,332,000 (HB300_SD1) in fiscal year 2025-2026 and $339,507,000 (HB300_SD1) in fiscal year 2026-2027.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The long-term fiscal plan is altered by the removal of the $200,000,000 (HB300_HD1_HSCR1172_) deposit into the emergency reserve fund, instead relying on other measures for flexibility. These include funding most new programs for only one year and implementing aggressive reductions of long-term vacant positions, which generates nearly $15,000,000 (HB300_SD1) in general fund savings for each fiscal year. The State's previously appropriated collective bargaining obligations are now specified to total an additional $135,246,478 (HB300_SD1) in FY26 and $161,185,454 (HB300_SD1) in FY27 in general funds. Additionally, the Senate draft adds funding for Senate priorities such as $15,000,000 (HB300_SD1) annually for the Healthcare Education Loan Repayment Program and 58.00 positions and $5,027,927 (HB300_SD1) in FY26 for the Ready Keiki initiative.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The measure is based on a more pessimistic revenue outlook following the March 12, 2025 Council on Revenues meeting, which lowered its forecast for fiscal year 2025-2026 by $213,280,000 (HB300_SD1). This updated forecast reflects increased economic risks, including the potential for federal layoffs and funding cuts. The budget's structure is designed to be resilient against these anticipated revenue challenges.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "Total capital improvement appropriations are amended to $3,722,213,000 (HB300_SD1) in fiscal year 2025-2026 and $2,047,775,000 (HB300_SD1) in fiscal year 2026-2027. A key change is the appropriation of $262,200,000 (HB300_SD1) in general funds (cash) for specific projects to stimulate the economy. Highlights of the Senate's capital budget include $195,000,000 (HB300_SD1) for Department of Education improvements, $52,000,000 (HB300_SD1) for Hawaii Convention Center repairs, and $193,802,000 (HB300_SD1) in FY26 for affordable housing projects.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The long-term fiscal strategy has shifted from building the emergency reserve fund to maintaining flexibility through other means. By funding most new initiatives for only one fiscal year, the budget avoids embedding new recurring costs, necessitating a re-evaluation of these programs in the next biennium. This approach, combined with savings from eliminating long-term vacant positions, is intended to provide the State with more options to adapt to economic conditions after the initial two-year period.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The fiscal note for Senate Draft 1 introduces significant changes from the House Draft 1 version. Total operating appropriations are lower, now at $19,930,242,350 (HB300_SD1) in FY26 and $19,735,840,017 (HB300_SD1) in FY27, based on a reduced revenue forecast from the Council on Revenues on March 12, 2025 (HB300_SD1). A major policy change is the rejection of the House's $200,000,000 (HB300_HD1_HSCR1172_) deposit into the Emergency and Budget Reserve Fund; this funding is redirected to $262,200,000 (HB300_SD1) in cash-funded capital projects as an economic stimulus, a decision influenced by the Governor's past vetoes of similar reserve deposits. The Senate draft is more aggressive in cutting long-term vacant positions, resulting in nearly $15,000,000 (HB300_SD1) in annual general fund savings, and funds most new programs for one year only to ensure future fiscal flexibility. Lastly, this version restores several items cut by the House, including a $49,500,000 (HB300_SD1) special fund ceiling for the Aloha Stadium project, $2,000,000 (HB300_SD1) for irrigation systems, and funding for Charter School teacher differentials and the Office of Wellness and Resilience."
