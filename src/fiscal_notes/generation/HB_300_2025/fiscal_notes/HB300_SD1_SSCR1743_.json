  "overview": "House Bill 300, Senate Draft 1 appropriates funds for the operating and capital improvement budget of the Executive Branch for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027. This version of the state budget aligns with Senate Majority priorities, focusing on strategic investments in education, housing, environmental sustainability, and agricultural innovation. The measure addresses fiscal uncertainty by reducing long-term vacant positions and utilizing general fund cash for key capital projects to stimulate the economy.",
  "appropriations": "The Senate Draft appropriates a total of $19.93 billion from all funds for fiscal year 2026, including $10.44 billion from general funds. For fiscal year 2027, the appropriation totals $19.74 billion from all funds, with $10.42 billion from general funds. Key allocations include funding to expand the Ready Keiki preschool initiative, restore funds for charter school teacher differentials, support affordable housing programs, and bolster biosecurity and agricultural irrigation systems.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The budget is based on the Council on Revenues' March 12, 2025, forecast, which lowered near-term revenue projections due to federal economic uncertainty and increased tax refunds. The methodology includes strategically reducing over 500 long-term vacant positions in accordance with Finance Memorandum No. 24-10 to achieve savings across all financing means. Additionally, it shifts significant capital improvement project funding from general obligation bonds to general fund cash, aiming to provide immediate economic stimulus.",
  "agency_impact": "This budget significantly impacts state agencies by funding critical programs while implementing fiscal austerity through the elimination of long-term vacant positions. Departments like Education and Human Services receive substantial funding for key initiatives such as Ready Keiki and homeless services, while the Department of Land and Natural Resources and the Department of Agriculture see increased investment in biosecurity and resource management. The budget restores funds for the Agribusiness Development Corporation, Hawaii Tourism Authority, and Stadium Authority that were reduced in the House Draft, enabling them to advance key economic and community projects.",
  "economic_impact": "The budget is designed to stimulate the state's economy by appropriating $262.2 million in general funds for cash-funded capital improvement projects, which is expected to boost the construction industry and mitigate potential negative impacts from federal policy changes. Funding for agencies like the Hawaii Tourism Authority is intended to rebuild key international markets and generate tax revenue, supporting thousands of jobs. The measure also addresses the high cost of living by funding programs aimed at affordable housing and workforce development.",
  "policy_impact": "This measure implements key Senate Majority legislative priorities by directing funds toward specific policy goals, such as expanding early childhood education through the Ready Keiki initiative and addressing housing shortages with the 99-year leasehold program. It modifies state workforce policy by eliminating over 500 long-term vacant positions, aiming to improve efficiency and achieve savings. The budget also strengthens environmental and agricultural policy by funding biosecurity, watershed protection, and irrigation system improvements, aligning state spending with long-term sustainability goals.",
  "revenue_sources": "The appropriations are primarily supported by general fund tax revenues, as forecasted by the Council on Revenues. Other major funding sources include various special funds generated by agency fees like those from airports and harbors, federal funds for programs like Medicaid and transportation, and general obligation bonds for capital projects. The budget reflects a cautious approach to general fund expenditures due to lowered revenue projections and uncertainty surrounding future federal funding levels.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "This budget establishes significant ongoing fiscal commitments while navigating near-term economic uncertainty. The capital improvement projects, funded by over $1.89 billion in general obligation bonds over the biennium, will create long-term debt service obligations extending well beyond the next six years. Recurring appropriations for new permanent positions in areas like biosecurity, nursing, and the Office of Wellness and Resilience will require sustained general fund support, with costs expected to rise due to collective bargaining. The Council on Revenues forecasts modest but positive revenue growth through fiscal year 2031, which will be necessary to support these recurring expenses. To maintain fiscal flexibility amidst federal uncertainty, many new programmatic initiatives, such as those for financial literacy and homeless outreach services, are funded for only fiscal year 2026, requiring future legislative action for continuation. The elimination of over 500 long-term vacant positions is projected to generate ongoing savings of nearly $50 million annually across all funds. The state's fixed costs for retirement, health benefits, and existing debt service are projected to increase from $3.8 billion in fiscal year 2026 to $3.9 billion in fiscal year 2027, representing a significant and growing portion of the general fund budget. The budget also accounts for the Maui wildfire settlement, with payments of $400 million in fiscal year 2026 and $407.5 million in fiscal year 2027, placing additional pressure on future budgets. The overall fiscal strategy reflects a balance between stimulating the economy with immediate cash infusions for capital projects and exercising caution with recurring programmatic spending.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "This measure does not create new general operating revenue sources but appropriates from existing ones, such as the general fund, special funds, and federal funds. The budget for the Hawaii Tourism Authority, which is funded by general funds, is intended to support marketing and branding activities that attract visitors and stimulate economic activity, thereby generating future transient accommodations tax and general excise tax revenues. Similarly, funding for programs that enhance economic diversification, such as the Agribusiness Development Corporation, is expected to indirectly support long-term state tax revenue growth.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The measure authorizes significant capital expenditures totaling $3.72 billion in fiscal year 2026 and $2.05 billion in fiscal year 2027 from all funding sources. Major capital investments include $195 million for Department of Education facility improvements, over $318 million for affordable and university housing projects over the biennium, and $98 million for health and safety repairs statewide. A key feature of this budget is the appropriation of $262.2 million in general fund cash for these projects to provide immediate economic stimulus.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "Beyond the initial six-year period, the State will have ongoing fiscal obligations primarily related to the debt service on the $1.89 billion in general obligation bonds authorized for capital projects. Recurring personnel costs for new permanent positions established in this budget will continue to be a significant expenditure, subject to future collective bargaining increases. The long-term sustainability of programs will depend on continued revenue growth matching or exceeding the modest projections from the Council on Revenues.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "This is the initial fiscal note for the Senate Draft 1 version of the bill. It reflects significant changes from the House Draft 1, primarily by restoring funding for key Senate priorities and implementing a more comprehensive reduction of long-term vacant positions. The Senate Draft restores funding for agricultural irrigation systems, the New Aloha Stadium Entertainment District, the 99-year leasehold housing program, and public charter school teacher differentials, which were substantially reduced in the House Draft. Furthermore, this version shifts over $262 million in capital improvement funding from general obligation bonds to general fund cash to provide immediate economic stimulus in response to updated fiscal forecasts and federal uncertainty."
