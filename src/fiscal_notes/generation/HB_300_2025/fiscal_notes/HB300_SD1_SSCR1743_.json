  "overview": "The purpose and intent of this measure is to appropriate funds for the operating and capital improvement budget of the executive branch for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027 (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt). Your Committee has amended this measure to advance meaningful solutions and continue providing the support our communities need to thrive, focusing on priorities including education and workforce development, housing and homelessness, and environmental sustainability and infrastructure (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt). This wholistic approach makes strategic appropriations to promote system changes and implement priorities of the Senate (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt).",
  "appropriations": "The Senate Draft No. 1 (SD1) appropriates $19,930,242,350 (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt) in all funds for operations in fiscal year 2025-2026, including $10,436,542,543 (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt) in general funds (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt). For fiscal year 2026-2027, it appropriates $19,735,840,017 (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt) in all funds, with $10,421,715,049 (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt) in general funds (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt). Highlights include adding $15,000,000 (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt) in FY26 and FY27 for the Healthcare Education Loan Repayment Program, adding $5,000,000 (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt) in FY26 to support state agencies addressing homeless encampments, and adding $465,000 (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt) in FY26 and FY27 for differentials for Charter Schools teachers (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt).",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The budget is based on the Council on Revenues' March 12, 2025 forecast, which was lowered for fiscal years 2024-2025 and 2025-2026, meaning a decrease in revenues by $213,280,000 (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt) for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $218,612,000 (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt) for fiscal year 2026-2027 (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt). The approach accounts for near-term risks identified by the Economic Research Organization at the University of Hawaii, including federal layoffs and funding cuts (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt). In accordance with Finance Memorandum No. 24-10, the Senate Draft reduces positions vacant since July 1, 2020, using updated lists from each department to calculate savings (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt).",
  "agency_impact": "The Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (DCR) supports the bill but seeks support for CIP requests not funded in HB 300, HD1, including $20M (HB300_HD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-18-25_.PDF.txt) for security fencing repairs and a $10M (HB300_HD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-18-25_.PDF.txt) 10-Year Departmental Master Plan (HB300_HD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-18-25_.PDF.txt). The Department of Human Services (DHS) supports the measure and provides comments on the impacts of HD1 amendments, such as changing Kauhale funds to a $1 (HB300_HD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-18-25_.PDF.txt) placeholder, which \"impacts future operation and maintenance of existing Kauhale\" (HB300_HD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-18-25_.PDF.txt). The University of Hawai‘i (UH) supports the bill and provides details on its operating budget requests, including making the Mānoa Athletics subsidy of $3,200,000 (HB300_HD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-18-25_.PDF.txt) permanent and funding for debt service for the JABSOM Kaka'ako Health & Wellness Campus (HB300_HD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-18-25_.PDF.txt).",
  "economic_impact": "Your Committee has set aside general funds in the amount of $262,200,000 (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt) for capital improvement projects to \"provide a near-term stimulus for the economy\" (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt). Testimony from the Hawaiʻi Tourism Authority (HTA) indicates that fully funding the Governor’s request for HTA, including the $6 million (HB300_HD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-18-25_.PDF.txt) as detailed in GM4, \"will result in $336.3 million (HB300_HD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-18-25_.PDF.txt) in state tax revenue and support 25,901 jobs in FY 2026\" (HB300_HD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-18-25_.PDF.txt). This is equivalent to \"$4.5 million (HB300_HD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-18-25_.PDF.txt) for every $1 million (HB300_HD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-18-25_.PDF.txt) of HTA Budget\" (HB300_HD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-18-25_.PDF.txt).",
  "policy_impact": "The amendments proposed by your Committee \"reaffirm the commitment of the Senate to advance solutions that help our communities thrive,\" focusing on strategic investments that align with Senate Majority priorities (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt). These priorities include education and workforce development; housing and homelessness; environmental sustainability and infrastructure; and agricultural innovation (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt). The budget reflects a policy of fiscal prudence by reducing long-term vacant positions and providing funding in fiscal year 2025-2026 only for most new programs to allow for flexibility in the face of economic uncertainties (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt).",
  "revenue_sources": "The budget is primarily funded by general funds, with the Council on Revenues lowering its forecast for general fund tax revenues on March 12, 2025, projecting $9,820,678,000 (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt) for FY 2026 and $10,105,506,000 (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt) for FY 2027 (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt). Other funding sources include federal funds, special funds, and bonds. The Senate Draft's capital improvement budget appropriates $1,556,332,000 (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt) in fiscal year 2025-2026 and $339,507,000 (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt) in fiscal year 2026-2027 in general obligation bond funds (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt).",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The Council on Revenues' forecast extends through fiscal year 2031, projecting general fund tax revenues of $10,358,144,000 (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt) in FY 2028, $10,627,456,000 (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt) in FY 2029, $10,829,378,000 (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt) in FY 2030, and $11,165,089,000 (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt) in FY 2031 (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt).

The University of Hawai'i notes that debt service payments for the JABSOM Kaka'ako campus will continue until July 1, 2033 (HB300_HD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-18-25_.PDF.txt). Many departmental requests, such as for teacher differentials and healthcare programs, are for recurring expenses, indicating continued costs beyond the biennium. The capital improvement projects funded by this measure will create long-term debt service obligations for the State.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The Council on Revenues lowered its forecast for general fund tax revenues on March 12, 2025, projecting a decrease of $213,280,000 (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt) for fiscal year 2025-2026 (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt). Testimony from Maui Health System states that \"hospital reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid and Commercial Insurance companies is increasing by less than 3% while the cost of labor, medical supplies and drugs are forecasted to continue to outpace reimbursement,\" indicating a strain on the operating revenue for state-supported hospitals (HB300_HD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-18-25_.PDF.txt). The measure does not introduce new general revenue sources but supports programs that leverage other funds; for instance, the Department of Human Services notes that general fund additions for federally funded programs will allow access to approximately $58.89M (HB300_HD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-18-25_.PDF.txt) in additional federal matching funds in FY2026 (HB300_HD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-18-25_.PDF.txt).",

  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The State faces long-term fiscal obligations from capital projects funded by bonds, which will require debt service payments for many years. Many of the operating budget appropriations are for recurring costs for positions and programs, such as teacher differentials and homeless services, which are expected to continue beyond the six-year planning horizon. The Council on Revenues' forecast, extending to fiscal year 2031, provides a longer-term outlook on the State's revenue capacity to meet these ongoing commitments (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt).",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "This fiscal note is based on the Senate Draft 1 (SD1) of HB 300, which introduces significant changes from the previous House Draft 1 (HD1). The SD1 operating budget is lower, appropriating $19,930,242,350 (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt) in all funds for FY26, compared to the HD1's $20,484,862,473. The SD1 reflects the Senate's priorities, including strategic investments in education, housing, and agriculture, and restores several key appropriations that were reduced in the HD1, such as $2,000,000 (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt) for irrigation systems, a $49,500,000 (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt) special fund ceiling for the New Aloha Stadium Entertainment District, $465,000 (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt) for Charter School teacher differentials, and $876,000 (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt) for the Office of Wellness and Resilience's State of Well-Being Project (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt). A major policy shift is the Senate's decision to cash-fund $262,200,000 (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt) in capital improvement projects to stimulate the economy, instead of depositing funds into the emergency and budget reserve fund as the HD1 proposed, citing the Governor's previous vetoes of such deposits (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt). Additionally, the SD1 implements more aggressive reductions for long-term vacant positions, resulting in nearly $15,000,000 (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt) in general-fund savings annually (HB300_SD1_SSCR1743_.PDF.txt)."
