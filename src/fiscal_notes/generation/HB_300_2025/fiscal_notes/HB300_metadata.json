This measure, as introduced, includes the base budget from Act 164, Session Laws of Hawaii 2023, as amended by Act 230, Session Laws of Hawaii 2024, previously appropriated collective bargaining amounts, and adjustments for retirement, health, debt service, and Medicaid requirements (HB300). Following the latest downward forecast from the Council on Revenues, the Senate has adopted a budget that maintains essential services for the State's most vulnerable populations and proactively expands the economy through strategic investments in emerging sectors (HB300).\",\n\"appropriations\": \"The Senate Draft's capital improvement budget appropriates $1,556,332,000 (HB300) in fiscal year 2025-2026 and $339,507,000 (HB300) in fiscal year 2026-2027 in general obligation bond funds (HB300). The total operating budget in the Senate Draft (SD1) is $19,930,242,350 (HB300) in all funds for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $19,735,840,017 (HB300) for fiscal year 2026-2027 (HB300). Specific appropriations include adding $465,000 (HB300) in FY26 and FY27 for differentials for Charter Schools teachers and $2,000,000 (HB300) in FY26 to supplement the revolving fund to keep irrigation water rates affordable (HB300).\",\n\"assumptions_and_methodology\": \"The budget formulation includes several components: \\\"The base budget from Act 164, Session Laws of Hawaii 2023, as amended by Act 230, Session Laws of Hawaii 2024 (HB300),\\\" \\\"Previously appropriated collective bargaining amounts from prior acts (HB300),\\\" and \\\"Adjustments necessary to fulfill the Employee's Retirement System, Employer-Union Health Benefits Trust Fund, debt service, and Medicaid requirements for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027 (HB300).\\\" The Senate amended the measure to \\\"reduce positions vacant since July 1, 2020 (HB300),\\\" using updated lists from departments and data from Budget Journal Tables (HB300).

The Department of Agriculture testified that failing to secure a $2,000,000 (HB300) appropriation would cause irrigation costs to more than double, rising from $0.50 (HB300) to $1.11 (HB300) per 1,000 gallons (HB300).\",\n\"economic_impact\": \"The budget aims for a near-term economic stimulus through strategic use of funds for capital improvement projects, as \\\"Cash-funded capital improvement projects boost the construction industry (HB300).\\\" In response to a downward revenue forecast, the budget seeks to proactively expand the economy through strategic investments in emerging sectors such as agricultural innovation (HB300). For example, a recommended appropriation of $2,000,000 (HB300) for irrigation systems is intended to keep water rates affordable for local farmers and support agricultural production, as failure to provide these funds would result in a \\\"significant cost increase (HB300)\\\" for farmers (HB300).\",\n\"policy_impact\": \"This measure advances the Senate Majority's priorities for the 2025 Regular Session, including education, housing, environmental sustainability, and agricultural innovation (HB300).

The Governor's proposed budget included federal funding of $3,875,555,199 (HB300) for operating costs in fiscal year 2025-2026 and $3,839,750,906 (HB300) in fiscal year 2026-2027 (HB300).\",\n\"six_year_fiscal_implications\": \"The six-year fiscal outlook is marked by significant obligations and revenue uncertainty.

To maintain flexibility, the Senate Committee funded \\\"most new programs to allow for fiscal flexibility (HB300)\\\" in fiscal year 2025-2026 only (HB300). The Committee also set aside $262,200,000 (HB300) in general funds for capital improvement projects as a near-term stimulus (HB300).
