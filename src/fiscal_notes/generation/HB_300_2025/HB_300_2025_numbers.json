The National Association of Attorneys General (NAAG), who oversees the U.S.'s Tobacco MSA, predicted that the annual MSA payments to the participating states would decline over time. MSA payment levels are affected by U.S. inflation, U.S. cigarette and roll-your-own tobacco consumption, and cigarette manufacturers' income. NAAG has not published a forecasted future payment schedule; however, a few participating states (e.g., Colorado) have forecasted annual MSA state payment declines between 3% and 8% in any given year. In April 2024, the MSA payment to Hawaiʻi of $36,425,172.62 was 11% less than the prior year’s payment of $40,862,842.25. Due to this MSA payment reduction, for the first time, the medical school’s annual MSA allocation of $8,833,034.88 will not fully cover the medical school’s FY2025 bond debt service obligation of $9,395,723 (i.e., a shortage of $562,688). The medical school’s Kakaʻako Health and Wellness revenue bond debt service payments end on July 1, 2033. If the April 2025 MSA payment declines by 11% or higher, the medical school will be forced to use its tuition allocation.

FCILs are an important component of a strong, mixed-delivery early learning system, offering families flexibility in choosing the type of early childhood development and learning experiences that best meet their needs. They promote children’s well-being by supporting families in their growth as their children’s first and most important teachers. The programs provide activities and opportunities for families who may not be interested in or able to participate in more traditional child care or preschool programs.

FNS offered Hawaii the option of paying the penalty in whole or agreeing to reinvest 50% of the penalty into improvements that would result in an improvement of its payment error rate. Hawaii elected to enter into an agreement with FNS to reinvest 50% of the penalty into system improvements to automate the eligibility and payment determination process. The 50% of the $10.9M FNS penalty will be requested through an emergency appropriation for FY25 for $5,467,164.

A recent analysis by the Prison Policy Initiative noted that pretrial incarceration is overused in the state, undermining the presumption of innocence and negatively implanting public health and public safety. More jail beds would worsen lasting racial disparities in the state’s criminal legal system, with those who are Native Hawaiian, Pasifika, or Black subject to heightened levels of surveillance, arrest, prosecution, incarceration, and post-release supervision. Further, a new facility will not rectify the persistent staffing problems faced at facilities administered by the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.

SEAC received a budget briefing on February 14th by the Department’s Budget Branch and agreed with the priorities of the Office of Student Support Services for additional funding in the following areas: • $10 million each year for contracted skilled nursing services, • $1.8 million in FY 27 for 20 licensed Mental Health Interventionists to support students at risk of suicide and needing intensive educational settings, and • $1.7 million for surveys and electronic platforms to capture data critical to managing student mental health. While general education has seen a gradual decline in enrollment for K-12 students since the beginning of the pandemic, the special education population has remained stable. These students are struggling to make up learning losses related to distance learning necessitated by the pandemic and often are experiencing higher rates of anxiety than their non disabled peers. We ask your Committee to appropriate the necessary funds to enable them to experience academic and socio- emotional growth. Respectfully, Martha Guinan, Chair S E A C Special Education",

    "text": "In recent years, Hawaii’s key justice system actors, including police, prosecutors, public defenders, judges, and service providers have been convening to jointly identify ways to reduce incarceration. There’s clear consensus: diversion to housing and services will significantly reduce the jail population and recidivism, not to mention save millions in taxpayer dollars. Unfortunately, this robust mandate is currently falling far short due to severe underfunding of diversion infrastructure in Hawai’i. “Divert to where?” is a common refrain by law enforcement and judges. Hawai’i County has no residential treatment center, residents have to fly to O’ahu. 2 Instead of an unnecessary new $1 billion super jail, the state must prioritize investing in a historic expansion of community based mental health treatment and a range of supportive housing—group homes, clean and sober beds, and permanent supportive housing. We also need big investments in the diversion workforce. For example, Hawai'i island has just one staff member conducting daily cell block assessments for diversion, leaving Kona completely neglected. Invest in What is Proven to Work and is Fiscally Responsible It costs $112,000 per year to incarcerate one adult in Hawai’i.

Hunt Development Group is in support of CIP Item No. 25.00 under the Hawaii Community Development Authority that seeks $1,000,000 to prepare a programmatic environmental impact statement to cover infrastructure projects, developments and master plan implementation in Kalaeloa Community Development District (KCDD). In 2022 and 2023, the Legislature appropriated funds for electrical improvements along Saratoga Avenue. In order to continue improving infrastructure in Kalaeloa to support new development projects, renovation and improvements, critical infrastructure improvements are needed. Hunt Development Group, in connection with its 535-acre portion of HCDA’s 3,700-acre Kalaeloa Master Plan, has succeeded in working with Gentry Homes to bring the first 389 new for-sale homes for local families to Kalaeloa, as well as completed construction on the new,",

There is much more to be done in terms of roadways, regional connections, utilities, and additional water and power infrastructure to make Kalaeloa the vibrant new addition for West Oahu families that is envisioned by HCDA’s Master Plan, and this capital improvement appropriation to prepare a programmatic environmental impact statement is a vital initial step to that dream becoming reality.

Lower Medicaid reimbursement rates have discouraged provider participation, limiting the number of specialists who accept Medicaid patients. This lack of participation results in restricted access to specialized services, delays in care, and worsening health outcomes for Medicaid recipients. The legislature’s 2023 decision to increase Medicaid reimbursement rates to 100% of Medicare rates has already made a significant impact, helping to cover the costs of care for providers, especially in rural areas, and ensuring that more residents receive timely and needed care. This step also brought nearly $85 million in federal funds to support healthcare access in the state. Making this increase permanent is critical to addressing healthcare inequities, encouraging provider participation, and sustaining access to care for Medicaid patients. Additionally, we strongly support making permanent the ceiling for the nursing and hospital sustainability programs.

The economic implications of this are profound. The state’s current rate of 2500 annual evictions lead to $30 million in public costs. Each instance of temporary homelessness due to evictions incurs substantial state expenses, encompassing emergency shelter costs, increased medical service utilization, and potential impacts on juvenile correction programs. Preventative measures—such as developing affordable housing and expanding rent assistance—are demonstrably more cost-effective. Every $1 spent on rent assistance saves the public $6 on homeless services.6 Despite the grim federal funding outlook, we commend the legislature for supporting substantial housing investments in the state budget.

Nearly a decade ago, House Concurrent Resolution No. 85, H.D.2, S.D.1 (2016) requested the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court make recommendations to the legislature on ways to improve Hawaii’s correctional system. The primary recommendation in response to that request was: “[T]hat Hawaii immediately begin to transition from a punitive to a rehabilitative correctional system. Evidence from other states and countries confirms that the rehabilitative approach is the only sustainable way to make our community safe mass incarceration does not work.” (Final Report of the House Concurrent Resolution 85 Task Force on Prison Reform to the Hawaii Legislature",

There are also things that much of the public does not get to see, such as our own neighbors locked up in jail/prison.

The funding provides the means for injured workers, employers, attorneys, and physicians to electronically file and access workers’ compensation and temporary disability cases in a secured cloud environment. To date, there’s been $16.7M invested in the project and without funding the Division would need to reinstitute paper-based claims and shut down the public portal. • $126,000 for two Human Resources Specialist IV positions to implement the Holo delegation and Act 186 hiring programs. The DLIR currently has 73 designated classes of work delegated by DHRD, these two positions will facilitate implementing Act 186 and facilitate participation in Holo delegation. • Two Labor Law Enforcement Specialist positions and funds to address the backlog of labor law complaints investigated by the Wage Standards Division.

Funds were encumbered: $274,500 ($305,000 minus 10% restriction). Expenditures in the prior year: Funds were appropriated through Act 125, SLH 2022/Act 133, SLH 2023 for a child visiting and family resource center at Waiawa Correctional Facility. A vendor was procured in November 2023 and awarded in January 2024. The contract was executed in May 2024. Of the $305,000 appropriated funds, 10% was restricted under execution policies, and $274,500 was released and encumbered. For FY24, family resource centers expended $219,950 out of the $270,000 ($300,000 minus 10% restriction) to develop HOSN, contract a vendor to establish the Waiawa Correctional Facility child visiting and family resource center, offer training, and purchase school furnishings to transform space into a family resource center. The total expended was $494,450. Other relevant factors: The devastation from the Maui Wildfires and the continuing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic highlight the need for mental health services and opportunities to build social capital for both children and adults.

However, the Project Completion lump-sum “bucket” was not included in HB 300, HD 1. This lump sum is critical as it funds construction management services and contingency costs associated with completing a construction project. The efficiency and effectiveness of executing CIP projects will be greatly hampered without funding in this lump sum. Funding for the construction of Lahaina Elementary School was moved from EDN 100 to EDN 450.

Conclusion: The Department is hopeful that the Committee can accommodate our budget requests, including the latest request for school food services. A sound system of financing public schools is critical as the National Conference of State Legislatures has recommended: Stability in revenues and expenditures is important for all publicly funded services, but in particular it is critical for education where wide fluctuations in funding levels may be disruptive.

Lower Medicaid reimbursement rates have discouraged provider participation, limiting the number of specialists who accept Medicaid patients. This lack of participation results in restricted access to specialized services, delays in care, and worsening health outcomes for Medicaid recipients. The legislature’s 2023 decision to increase Medicaid reimbursement rates to 100% of Medicare rates has already made a significant impact, helping to cover the costs of care for providers, especially in rural areas, and ensuring that more residents receive timely and needed care. This step also brought nearly $85 million in federal funds to support healthcare access in the state. Making this increase permanent is critical to addressing healthcare inequities, encouraging provider participation, and sustaining access to care for Medicaid patients. Additionally, we strongly support making permanent the ceiling for the nursing and hospital sustainability programs. These programs have been instrumental in stabilizing funding for hospitals and nursing facilities, which are critical to delivering care to communities across Hawaii.

The Hawaiʿi Farm Bureau respectfully submits testimony in support of HB 300, HD1, with a request for funding allocations that will support Hawaii’s agricultural industry. Hawaii’s agricultural industry faces increasing challenges, including high operational costs, labor shortages, and climate-related disruptions. Strategic investments in infrastructure, research, and economic support programs are essential to ensure local food production's viability, reduce import dependency, and enhance the state’s overall food security. HFB respectfully requests the inclusion of the following HFB funding priorities in the state budget: AGR 122: $19.8 million for the Biosecurity Program: Invasive species have become one of the most devastating problems impacting Hawaiʿi. Many invasive species are damaging Hawaiʿi’s environment and economy. Hawaiʿi’s farmers and ranchers face ongoing challenges from invasive pests such as the coconut rhinoceros beetle, little fire ant, coffee berry borer, two-lined spittlebug, macadamia felted coccid, and varroa mite. These pests cause significant damage to crops, increase production costs, and threaten the viability of local agriculture. Once established, invasive species are costly and difficult to control, making prevention and early intervention essential.

Education and physical activity have been proven to reduce recidivism, yet Hawai‘i’s incarcerated women remain without these essential resources. Instead of wasting more money on jail planning, the state should prioritize education—both for those currently incarcerated, who typically read at a 4th to 6th grade level, and for youth to prevent future incarceration. Research shows that especially early childhood, vocational training, and higher education—significantly reduce crime rates by providing individuals with the skills and opportunities needed to succeed, while incarceration perpetuates disadvantage, disproportionately impacting Native Hawaiians and other marginalized groups. Spending $30 million on additional jail planning is a waste of taxpayer dollars. Our limited resources should be invested in real solutions that empower communities—not expand incarceration.

When I look around today at our islands, I am saddened by what I see. We have clearly not invested in the wellbeing of the people of this place. There are also things that much of the public does not get to see, such as our own neighbors locked up in jail/prison. According to Prison Policy Initiative, Hawai‘i’s incarceration rate stands out internationally, locking up a higher percentage of its people than almost any democratic country on Earth. Among those locked up, Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders, and Black residents are overrepresented. This should disturb all of us.",

We need to consider the conditions that can lead to someone being locked up in our legal system and address those. People don’t need to be locked up— they need supportive housing, healthcare, treatment, food, community services and support. We CAN’T fund these things if we’re spending nearly $1 billion on a new jail and even more to then keep people in there. Budgets reveal what and who we care about. The proposed budget includes an appropriation for the building of a new OCCC, but we don’t need a new $1 billion jail. Instead, we need to fund youth and education programs, affordable housing, job training, family strengthening and violence interruption programs, community-based health, treatment and reintegration programs rooted in evidence-based practices, and restorative justice to help us build communities that are safe, healthy, and equitable.

Tourism is the economic backbone of our state, generating billions of dollars in visitor spending annually and contributing billions more in state tax revenue. It is Hawai‘i’s largest return on investment, sustaining hundreds of thousands of jobs and supporting local businesses across all islands. For an industry that fuels our economy at this scale, it is critical that we continue to invest in its growth, stability, and sustainability. HTA plays a pivotal role in destination management, marketing, and stewardship to ensure that tourism remains responsible, culturally respectful, and economically beneficial for our residents.

Now that this responsibility has been codified, it is important that the mandates be funded as much as possible. The agency’s ability to promote Hawai‘i globally, restore international markets, and enhance destination stewardship programs is directly tied to adequate funding. Without sufficient resources, Hawai‘i risks losing its competitive edge in the global travel market, resulting in economic setbacks that will affect businesses and workers statewide. We respectfully urge the Legislature to fully fund HTA at $80 million in Fiscal Year 2026 to ensure that our tourism industry continues to thrive, our local businesses are supported, and our residents benefit from the economic opportunities that tourism provides.

Medicare and Medicaid make up 74 percent of HHSC revenues and so any reduction in federal funding for these government payors will have a substantial financial impact to HHSC facilities. The biggest impact to HHSC from potential cuts to the State MedQUEST program would be the potential loss of uncompensated care funds. HHSC receives approximately $60 million annually in revenue through the public hospital uncompensated care pool, which provides federal funds to partially subsidize HHSC’s losses from providing care to Medicaid, Med- QUEST, and uninsured patients. The Federal administration is currently scrutinizing these state-directed payments as a possible way to reduce federal Medicaid spending. Should the Federal administration decide to put a stop to the state-directed payment method, HHSC would work with the State MedQUEST program to develop a new method of obtaining federal funding for this financially underserved patient population.

However, this new method would take time to develop and would require approval from the Federal administration before a new method could be implemented. Moreover, many experts believe that the states’ federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) will be a target for cuts, which directly affects the uncompensated care funding calculation. For HHSC, a reduction in the FMAP by 10% could result in a $6 million decrease in uncompensated care funding. It is difficult to quantify some of the direct impacts to potential cuts to MedQUEST funding, but if the ability of MedQUEST to provide coverage to its current membership is compromised, the impact to HHSC could be a shift in payment status from MedQUEST coverage to uninsured, which would have a negative impact on HHSC reimbursements.

I am also a Sociology Instructor at UH Manoa and a volunteer instructor for a Creative Writing Project at the Women's Community Correctional Center. I’m testifying in opposition to provisions in HB300 that expand mass incarceration and the building of a new $1 billion super jail. The new super jail simply does not make sense; it is not needed. It significantly expands the capacity of the jail when many of the people in jail do not belong there. Roughly 40% of those in jail are houseless, many struggle with addiction, and many are held simply because they can't afford cash bail. These are not good reasons to be in jail. Investing in other forms of assistance is a much better use of our tax dollars, not to mention a much smarter way to keep our communities safe. Also, please recall that our state",

There is consensus among justice system actors-including judges, prosecutors, and service providers- that people suffering from mental illness and substance abuse disorder should be diverted out of jail and into treatment and housing. This would dramatically shrink the jail population, but to succeed, the state must fund diversion infrastructure. We are also in a time of fiscal crisis, and the state cannot afford to adequately fund diversion while also spending enormous amounts on expanding jails and prisons.

This funding is essential to maintain patients’ access to safety-net planning services, including education, counseling, and access to contraception. Investing in sexual and reproductive health care is good for the community and patients and vitally important. For every $1 invested in family planning, Hawaiʻi saves at least $7 on unintended pregnancy costs and long-term social costs that can be routed to other critical services. Thank you for supporting HB 300 and supporting reproductive healthcare for low-income, underinsured patients. HB 300 is a wise, humane, and cost effective investment in the health of our communities.

At least $7 for every $1 invested in family planning can be saved for services such as community outreach, affordable housing, mental health, and reform. A concrete action could be financially supporting healthcare organizations such as the Hawai'i Health and Harm Reduction Center and the Planned Parenthood clinic just a few blocks away from the State Captiol that provide reproductive and sexual health services such as education, STI testing, contraceptives, and counseling.

The National Association of Attorneys General (NAAG), who oversees the U.S.'s Tobacco MSA, predicted that the annual MSA payments to the participating states would decline over time.

NAAG has not published a forecasted future payment schedule; however, a few participating states (e.g., Colorado) have forecasted annual MSA state payment declines between 3% and 8% in any given year.

Deploy targeted trapping and fencing in key conservation areas. - **Cost-Effectiveness**: Rat traps cost approximately $5–$10 each, and fencing averages $20–$30 per linear foot. A $500,000 investment could secure 5,000 traps and 10 miles of fencing, protecting 10,000 acres—far less than the millions required for mosquito releases. - **Equity**: Engage local hunters and community groups in predator control, fostering economic opportunities and cultural participation. - **Impact**: Reducing breeding sites directly lowers mosquito populations, complementing bird survival without experimental risks. 2. **Natural Vector Control via Native Species (Safety and Efficacy)** - **Solution**: Introduce or bolster populations of native predators like the Hawaiian damselfly (Megalagrion spp.), which prey on mosquito larvae. Pilot projects could test their reintroduction in wetlands near conservation zones. - **Cost-Effectiveness**: Rearing and releasing damselflies",

Pilot projects could test their reintroduction in wetlands near conservation zones. - **Cost-Effectiveness**: Rearing and releasing damselflies costs an estimated $50,000 per site, with a one-time investment yielding self-sustaining populations—saving millions over recurring mosquito releases. - **Equity**: Partner with Native Hawaiian scientists and cultural practitioners to oversee restoration, ensuring alignment with traditional ecological knowledge. - **Impact**: This leverages natural systems, avoiding synthetic interventions while supporting biodiversity. 3. **Community-Driven Monitoring and Research (Cost-Effectiveness and Equity)** - **Solution**: Fund citizen science programs to monitor mosquito and bird populations, paired with university-led studies on avian malaria resistance. Allocate resources to explore genetic resilience in honeycreepers rather than altering mosquitoes. - **Cost-Effectiveness**: A $200,000 annual grant could train 100 community members and support graduate research,",

Require public hearings in affected communities. - **Cost-Effectiveness**: An EIS costs $100,000–$200,000, a",

Although the poliovirus would not be effective as a bioweapon, this experiment shows how an artificial virus can be synthesized relatively easily in a lab with just a digital viral genome. It was only a matter of time before a more dangerous pathogen would be synthesized. This occurred in 2017, when a group of Canadian scientists, as part of an effort to create a safer smallpox vaccine, synthesized the horsepox virus. Using around $100,000 worth of chemicals, equipment and staff who were largely untrained in genetic engineering or synthetic biology, they applied the same method to recreate the related variola virus that causes smallpox (Noyce, 2018a). The close relation of the horsepox virus to the variola virus suggested that the same method could be applied to recreate the variola virus. Back in 2003, a national security report had already warned about just this eventuality when considering the national security implications of synthesizing the poliovirus (Van Aken, 2003): “However, the method for creating polio virus artificially cannot be directly transferred to the smallpox virus.

Threats to Tourism: We have already questioned why, as Bali is not a dengue hotspot, it was chosen as a release site by the WMP. Prof. Northcott speculates that, as one of the top tourist destinations in the world, Bali is a useful ‘poster child’ to publicise the work of the WMP: The BMGF are extremely good at marketing and this is the reason for the focus on Bali. It has nothing to do with health. Ten deaths at most last year from haemorrhagic dengue fever in Bali does not require $1 billion of public investment in genetically engineered mosquitoes to put right. Ironically, if the Bali project does go ahead, worldwide publicity about mosquito releases might contribute to the island’s undoing as a tourist destination. Prior to the Covid lockdowns, tourism contributed nearly five percent to Indonesia’s GDP, with Bali being the major source. The lockdowns devastated tourism, having a massive impact on the economy and on the lives and livelihoods of those dependent on the industry. Since the country reopened its borders, tourism has been recovering, but it cannot afford another shock. And releasing engineered mosquitoes in Bali could just",

I have worked in the human services field for almost 40 years and am strongly opposed to bill HB300. I oppose provisions in HB300 that expand mass incarceration and the building of a new $1 billion jail. The work I asssiting those released from incarceration without any supports, any supports, is grossly underfunded. As a result, cycles of incarceration keep people dependent and trapped in the incarceration system. My work can pop maybe 1:100 people I work with out and the rest simply continue to spin in circles without any assistance. This legislation is misdirected and does not address root causes. The proposed budget includes an appropriation for the building of a \"new\" OCCC. We don’t need a new, $1 billion jail. Instead, we need to fund youth and education programs, affordable housing, job training,",

Our team continues to work with our community partners to reduce the number of kupuna waiting for access to long-term care or skilled nursing beds but continue to have over 25 patients living in the hospital, utilizing an acute care bed when they need long term care. On Maui, adequate long term care beds are available but remain empty, reportedly because there are not staff available to provide care. We absorb approximately $4 million in costs while awaiting long-term care availability.

A critical component of this bill is the allocation of $3,000,000 for each fiscal year to support reproductive health and family planning services. This funding is essential to maintain access to comprehensive sexual and reproductive health care for Hawaiʻi residents, particularly those served by safety net providers like Planned Parenthood. Safety net providers play a vital role in delivering essential health services, including contraception, cancer screenings, STI testing and treatment, and prenatal care. They ensure that all individuals, regardless of income or insurance status, have access to necessary health care. The proposed funding will help these providers continue offering high-quality care and address the unique needs of our diverse communities. Without",
