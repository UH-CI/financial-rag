PART
II. GENERAL FUND REVENUES AND ECONOMY
The Council on Revenues, in its January 2025 meeting, increased
the projected revenue growth for fiscal year 2025 from 3.5% to 6.4% while at
the same time decreasing the projection for fiscal year 2026 from 2.2% to
-1.5%.
In its March 2025 meeting, the Council decreased the forecast
for fiscal year 2025 from 6.4% to 5.0% while also lowering its forecast for fiscal
year 2026 from -1.5% to -2.25%.
The Council commented that the fiscal year 2025 decrease in its
March 2025 meeting was in part due to "higher than expected individual and
corporate tax refunds that were not accounted for in the January 2025 forecast",
while the decrease for fiscal year 2026 in the same meeting was due to
"the heightened economic uncertainty caused by policy changes at the
Federal level."
The table below reflects the most recent estimate of general fund
tax revenues for fiscal years 2025 through 2031 as reported by the Council on
Revenues in its March 2025 general fund forecast.
