In Support 
H.B. No. 300, Relating to the State Budget 
 
Chair Yamashita, Vice Chair Takenouchi, and Members of the House Committee on 
Finance: 
 
The Office of the Governor supports H.B. No. 300, Relating to the State Budget.  We 
respectfully ask for your favorable consideration of our Executive Budget requests. 
 
On December 16, 2024, Governor Green, M.D., submitted the Executive Budget for the 
2025-2027 Fiscal Biennium (FB) to the Legislature. The Administration's total requests include 
$10.5 billion in general funds and $3.4 billion in Capital Improvement Projects (CIP) for Fiscal 
Year (FY) 2026, and $10.5 billion in general funds and $2.5 billion in CIP for FY 2027. These 
requests include funding for priority areas to address significant needs in the following areas: 
 
1. Affordable housing, infrastructure, and homelessness 
 
• $50,000,000 in general funds for each fiscal year to restore and increase general 
fund support for the development, maintenance, and operation of kauhale; 
• $50,000,000 in general obligation (G.O.) bonds for each fiscal year for cash 
infusions to the Rental Housing Revolving Fund (RHRF); 
• $75,000,000 in G.O. bonds for each fiscal year for cash infusions to the RHRF for 
Tier II affordable housing projects;  
• $20,000,000 in G.O. bonds for each fiscal year for infusions to the Dwelling Unit 
Revolving Fund (DURF); 
• $12,102,000 in G.O. bonds for FY 26 and $17,898,000 in G.O. bonds for FY 27 for 
the 99-Year Leasehold Program, Phase 2; 
• $25,000,000 in G.O. bonds for each fiscal year for UH Mānoa, Student Housing 
Services Improvements; 
• $56,000,000 in G.O. bonds for FY 26 for Mayor Wright and Ka Lei Momi.

• $6,500,000 in G.O. bonds for FY 26 and $4,500,000 in G.O. bonds for FY 27 for 
UH West Oʻahu to renew, improve, and modernize. 
 
2. Healthcare 
 
• $15,000,000 in general funds for each fiscal year for the Healthcare Education 
Loan Repayment Program (HELP); 
• $87,000,000 in each fiscal year in operating subsidy to support rural health care 
systems; and 
• $44,000,000 in CIP funding for Hawaiʻi Health Systems Corporation (HHSC) 
facilities, including Keaʻau Outpatient Center and Kona Community Hospital 
Emergency Department. 
 
3. Hazard mitigation 
 
• $2,212,000 in general funds for each fiscal year for the Office of the State Fire 
Marshal to transfer to the Department of Defense; 
• $15,000,000 in general funds for FY 26 for the Department of Transportation to 
construct fire breaks; and 
• 27.00 positions and $2,200,000 in general funds for each fiscal year to increase 
the base level of positions at the Hawaiʻi Emergency Management Agency (HI-
EMA) for long-term disaster preparedness. 
 
To support the responsibilities of the Office of the Governor, we respectfully ask for your 
favorable consideration of the following request: 
 
• Six full-time (6.00 FTE) permanent positions and $725,000 in general funds for 
each fiscal year for federal affairs and boards and commissions positions. 
 
The federal landscape has changed drastically within the past few months, with more 
changes likely on the horizon. Keeping abreast of federal affairs, establishing working 
relationships with federal agencies, and conducting advocacy on behalf of the State are needed 
now more than ever. The Office of the Governor requests the addition of 5.00 federal affairs 
positions, 3.00 to be stationed in Washington, D.C., and 2.00 to be here in Hawaiʻi. As the State 
continues to navigate these uncertain times, these federal affairs positions will provide a crucial 
lifeline through which to facilitate quick responses to and advocacy around federal funding and 
resources. 
 
The final 1.00 position requested will support the State's more than 170 boards and 
commissions.  Over 1,400 state residents serve on a state board or commission, and the Office 
of the Governor's Boards and Commissions Team, which is currently comprised of one person,

requires further assistance to ensure each applicant and nominee is thoroughly vetted and

The Office of the Governor appreciates your consideration of our request. Thank you for 
the opportunity to provide testimony on this measure.

House Bill 300 
RELATING TO THE STATE BUDGET. 
Adjusts and requests appropriations for fiscal biennium 2025-2027 funding 
requirements for operations and capital improvement projects of Executive Branch 
agencies and programs. 
 
Edward N. Chu 
President and Chief Executive Officer  
Hawaii Health Systems Corporation 
 
On behalf of the Hawaii Health Systems Corporation (HHSC) Corporate Board of Directors, 
thank you for the opportunity to present testimony in support with requested amendments 
to H.B. 300 that adjusts and requests appropriations for fiscal biennium 2025-2027 funding 
requirements for operations and capital improvement projects of Executive Branch agencies 
and programs.   
 
Hawaii Health Systems Corporation (HHSC) plays a vital role in the healthcare delivery 
system for the State of Hawaii. In fiscal year 2024, HHSC’s acute discharges for the four 
HHSC regions were 14,017, which accounts for approximately 13% of all acute care 
discharges in the State of Hawaii.  In fiscal year 2024, HHSC’s emergency department visits 
for the four HHSC regions were 91,459, representing approximately 19% of all emergency 
department visits statewide.   
 
The impact of HHSC’s facilities on the neighbor islands is even more impressive.   
• For residents of the County of Hawaii, HHSC’s facilities cared for over 70% of all acute 
care discharges and 81% of all emergency department visits. 
• For residents of the County of Kauai, HHSC’s facilities cared for approximately 22% of 
all acute care discharges and 40% of all emergency department visits.

H.B. 300 
Healthcare Landscape 
 
Healthcare providers operate in a very complex, highly regulated, and rapidly changing 
environment with constant pressure from payors to deliver higher quality care at a lower cost. 
Development of health information technology, physician networks, quality improvement, and 
expertise in healthcare compliance rules and regulations and the revenue cycle is essential 
for successful hospital operations.  Private hospitals have invested substantially in these 
areas while HHSC, with limited resources, is challenged to keep pace. 
 
Historical Challenges 
 
HHSC’s facilities face challenges such as: 
• Large percentage of Medicaid/QUEST and uninsured patients.  Government payors 
(i.e. Medicare and MedQUEST) accounted for approximately 74% of HHSC’s payor 
mix for fiscal year 2024.  
• Inadequate government and third-party reimbursements for healthcare services. 
• Labor costs well above industry norms.  HHSC’s fringe benefit rate as a state agency 
is 64% as compared to the average private Hawaii hospital fringe benefit rate of 30%.  
Given HHSC’s salaries expense, that difference alone represents $90 million of 
HHSC’s need for general fund appropriations. 
• Difficulty in attracting and retaining specialized health sector workforce in rural 
communities due to cost of living and lack of education and training opportunities. 
• High cost contracted nursing and other clinical personnel to meet staffing shortages. 
• Small-scale operations which are costly to maintain. 
• The need for capital investment in new medical technology. 
• Aging facilities, with life and safety code issues and deferred maintenance, well 
beyond the average for similar facilities across the country. 
• The impact of national changes to healthcare policy, federal mandates, and federal 
budget reductions. 
 
Accomplishments 
 
In spite of its many challenges, HHSC continues to provide high quality healthcare to the 
island communities it serves and is making progress in key areas. The following are some of 
the major accomplishments over the past year:   
 
• Commitment to Providing Quality Care: 
o Hale Ho‘ola Hamakua, Hilo Benioff Medical Center, Leahi Hospital, Maluhia, 
and Samuel Mahelona Memorial Hospital achieved the highest possible overall 
five-star rating from Medicare’s Nursing Home Compare website. 
 
• Focus on Growing Revenue:  Despite the challenges of staffing shortages and 
increased operational costs, HHSC managed to increase its operating revenues for 
fiscal year 2024 approximately 11.3% from fiscal year 2023 and 24.3% from fiscal year 
2022. Two primary drivers of this revenue growth are:   

Page 3 
H.B. 300 
o Achieving Equity with Hawaii Private Hospitals in Commercial Contract 
Negotiations:  Utilizing the resources of a consulting firm and published 
payment rates available as a result of federal price transparency legislation, 
HHSC continued its negotiation of contracts for its commercial lines of business 
that will bring HHSC’s reimbursement rates for healthcare services up to par 
with those of the private hospitals in the State of Hawaii.  The increases in 
reimbursement rates have contributed to HHSC’s revenue growth in fiscal year 
2024, and will continue into the future as new contracts are negotiated. 
o Focus on Revenue-Generating Services that Improve Services to the 
Community: In fiscal year 2024, Hilo Benioff Medical Center developed revenue 
generating services by continuing to expand their specialty care services 
including dermatology and plastic surgery. A new CT scanner was installed at 
Samuel Mahelona Memorial Hospital in fiscal year 2024. Not only did it 
generate new revenue for the facility, it provided residents on the east and north 
sides of Kauai with CT services that previously did not exist. The closest facility 
with CT services required residents to drive nearly 30 miles from their home. 
Samuel Mahelona Memorial Hospital also became a provider of meals to 
homebound seniors on the island of Kauai for the Meals on Wheels program. 
With the successful expansion of their meal service delivery, the facility also 
sells meals to the local community. 
 
• Maximizing Federal Funding Opportunities:  HHSC’s East Hawaii and Kauai Regions 
have continued to convert some of their outpatient clinics to rural health clinics to 
achieve enhanced Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement for those services. As a 
result of the conversions to rural health clinics, in fiscal year 2024, revenue increased 
by approximately $16 million from the previous fiscal year. HHSC worked with the 
State of Hawaii MedQUEST Division to establish a public hospital uncompensated 
care pool which provides federal funds to partially subsidize HHSC’s losses from 
providing care to Medicaid, MedQUEST, and uninsured patients. HHSC received over 
$66 million in funds in fiscal year 2024 from this program. HHSC has also been 
successful in working with Hawaii’s Congressional delegation to obtain Congressional 
Directed Spending grants, receiving $2.5 million for electronic medical records 
optimization for the HHSC-West Hawaii Region. 
 
• Seeking Philanthropy:  HHSC’s facilities have always worked with their associated 
foundations to provide funding for medical equipment and other needed items for the 
facilities. HHSC facilities have successfully sought private funding through 
philanthropy. In fiscal year 2024, the HHSC-East Hawaii Region secured an 
astonishing $50 million donation to help build out critical areas of care of the existing 
hospital, including a state-of-the-art family birthing center and intensive care unit. The 
donation will also support a neurosurgical program and behavioral health services.

HHSC BUDGET REQUEST 
 
HHSC-Regions Fiscal Years 2026-2027 Budget Request (HTH 210 & 212) 
 
Please note that the funding amounts and requests under HTH 212 do not include the Oahu 
Region of HHSC, as Act 248, SLH 2022, established a new organization code for the HHSC-
Oahu Region (HTH 215).  As a result, HTH 212 (HHSC-Regions) is now comprised of the 
HHSC East Hawaii, West Hawaii, and Kauai Regions. 
 
A summary of the amounts appropriated for fiscal years 2024 and 2025, the total funding 
requested by HHSC-Regions for fiscal years 2026 and 2027, and recommended by the 
Governor for fiscal years 2026 and 2027 are summarized below. 
 
 
 
 
 
For context, the HTH212 percentage of general fund appropriation received as compared to 
Total Expenditures (Operating Expenses and Non-Operating Expenses) was approximately 
22% for fiscal year 2024.  The HTH212 requested level of general fund appropriations for 
fiscal years 2026 and 2027, represent approximately 24% and 22%, respectively, of 
HTH212’s projected Total Expenditures, which is remarkable given the increases in costs that 
have occurred since that time.  
 
The amount of HHSC’s request appears larger than it would normally be because the ARPA 
funds and general fund appropriations HHSC received in fiscal years 2022 and 2023 and 
additional general fund appropriations in fiscal year 2025 were marked as nonrecurring. 
These nonrecurring amounts total approximately $76 million that was reduced from HHSC’s 
fiscal year 2024 and 2025 funding amounts resulting in a base is that is below this year’s 
expenditures. The justifications for HHSC’s requests are shown below: 

Page 5 
H.B. 300 
 
 
Details for the loss of supplemental pandemic related funding are as follows: First, HHSC 
received Federal Provider Relief Fund grants totaling approximately $63.5 million from fiscal 
year 2020 through fiscal year 2022 that provided HHSC with the working capital needed to 
lower its general fund appropriation needs in fiscal years 2022 and 2023.  In addition, HHSC 
received $19.8 million in SBA Paycheck Protection Program loans which also lowered the 
need for HHSC to receive general fund appropriations in fiscal years 2022 and 2023.  A third 
factor are the changes in the DHS uncompensated care payments of $19.2 million to HHSC 
was a result of the federal Coronavirus state of emergency.  
 
These federal funds helped to finance the State mandated increases in fringe benefit rates 
and prior unfunded collective bargaining raises during fiscal years 2022 and 2023. Together, 
federal funds received provided approximately $102 million in funding that would otherwise 
have to come out of general fund appropriations. These federal funds do not even address 
the increase in costs associated with the unfunded mandates such as healthcare inflation 
costs, collective bargaining pay and fringe benefit rate increases for fiscal years 2024-2027. 
 
In November 2025, the East Hawaii region is implementing a new electronic medical record 
(EMR) system that will meet the needs of its providers and staff, providing a platform with 
enhanced workflows, functionality, and the ability to collaborate with other hospitals within 
Hawaii. The $13.2 million in fiscal year 2026 and $2.3 million in fiscal year 2027 for 
information technology (IT) infrastructure costs represent the resource costs needed to 
standup the system build and support on an ongoing basis. There are other HHSC regions 
exploring joining the region on the EMR system at a future date.

Oahu Region Fiscal Years 2026-2027 Budget Request (HTH 215) 
 
A summary of the amounts appropriated for fiscal years 2024 and 2025, the total funding 
requested by HHSC-Oahu Region for fiscal years 2026 and 2027, and recommended by the 
Governor for fiscal years 2026 and 2027 are summarized below. 
 
 
 
The Governor’s recommendation includes the same amounts as the HHSC-Oahu Region’s 
funding requests. 
 
Kahuku Medical Center Fiscal Years 2026-2027 Budget Request (HTH 211) 
 
A summary of the amounts appropriated for fiscal years 2024 and 2025, the total funding 
requested by Kahuku Medical Center for fiscal years 2026 and 2027, and recommended by 
the Governor for fiscal years 2026 and 2027 are summarized below. 
 
 
 
Kahuku Medical Center is requesting approval of its full funding requests and will be 
submitting their testimony to that effect. 
 
This testimony addresses only the amounts that would go to HTH 210, HTH 211, HTH 212, 
and HTH 215. We expect Maui Health System (HTH 214) will provide their own testimony in 
support of the amounts appropriated for those entities in this bill.  
 
CONCLUSION 
 
Despite our progress in financial and operational performance as indicated under 
“Accomplishments” above, HHSC is unable to keep up with collective bargaining pay 
increases and future mandated increases in the fringe rate for pension and retiree health 
insurance costs (OPEB). As documented in various media publications, access to high-

Page 7 
H.B. 300 
quality healthcare services in Hawaii’s rural communities is a growing need, and HHSC is 
uniquely positioned to meet the State of Hawaii’s constitutional obligation to ensure that those 
communities receive the healthcare services they deserve as citizens of the State of Hawaii.  
As a result, HHSC is respectfully requesting approval of its full funding request at a 
total funding level of $216,537,303 in fiscal year 2026 and $199,816,303 in fiscal year 
2027. 
 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify on this measure in support with requested 
amendments.

students to prepare them to be globally competitive, locally committed.
The budget as proposed includes increases to negotiated salaries (collective bargaining) for school 
employees, supports priority initiatives that provide services to schools – such as summer learning, 
Hawaiian education, and middle school after-school programs – and addresses the impact of inflation 
on centralized services, including school utilities and school service contacts.
In addition, the Department respectfully requests the Committee’s support for an emerging issue with 
our school food services budget.
Operating Budget:
The biennium budget presents opportunities to address the myriad challenges facing the Department 
and the urgent needs of our schools and students.  These challenges include inflationary pressures 
on core operating expenses, hiring and retaining a highly-qualified workforce, overcoming the lasting 
impacts of the pandemic, and alarming federal uncertainty.  
As such, our proposed budget:
Aligns with our Strategic Plan goals to ensure investments contribute to student success;
1.

Incorporates fiscal prudence as communicated by lawmakers and Executive Branch budget 
2.
instructions; and
Strives to provide predictable, reliable, and adequate funding for our public schools statewide.
3.
In comparison to the current general fund budget for Fiscal Year (FY) 25, the Department proposed a 
“flat” budget for FY 26 and FY 27.  The following chart provides a high-level perspective, which 
excludes the amounts for previously approved collective bargaining agreements. 
The first bar (all blue) shows the Department’s FY 25 general fund operating budget of $2.18 billion 
and includes $100.59 million in funding that will not be available in FY 26 and FY 27.
The second and third bars show the FY 26 and FY 27 general fund base appropriations (in blue) of 
about $2.08 billion plus the Executive Budget requests of $89.27 million in FY 26 and $87.73 million 
in FY 27 (in green) for a total of $2.17 billion and $2.16 billion respectively.  The operating budget as 
proposed, excluding collective bargaining amounts, decreases by $11.32 million in FY 26 and $12.86 
million in FY 27 for a “flat” budget.
The Department grouped its requests into categories or “buckets” shown in the following table.

$87,732,759
(100.0%)
The largest single category is for “Non-recurring Appropriation Reappraisal”, making up nearly 75% 
of the Department’s general fund budget requests.  The Department is seeking predictable, reliable, 
and adequate funding for these recurring expenses.
To avert the projected deficit of the school food services program, the Department humbly requests 
that the Committee include an additional $20 million for FY 26 and $24 million for FY 27.
Capital Improvement Projects (CIP) Budget:
The Department appreciates and supports HB 300 and is hopeful that if revenues allow, additional 
CIP funding in the amounts approved by the Hawaiʻi State Board of Education can be included.
The Department’s CIP request is significant because the Department manages over 21.5 million 
square feet of facilities across 266 sites statewide.  Prior approaches to the implementation of the 
Department’s CIP have not been effective in managing school facilities and meeting the needs of 
students across all islands.  As such, the Department is returning to a risk-based and proactive 
approach to address facilities and infrastructure needs.
Much of our CIP budget is organized into categories or “buckets” (except for two line items for 
specific schools).  For each bucket, we have developed a prioritized list of school projects.  These 
lump-sum buckets allow the Department to manage and execute projects with greater efficiency to 
meet the needs of schools and students.
To address concerns regarding the Department’s ability to implement CIP projects, the Department 
returned to a risk-based approach to prioritize and manage CIP projects.  This CIP budget is the 
Department’s first step toward a more fiscally responsible, targeted and sustainable strategy to 
distinguish between “necessities” and “wants” to address the infrastructure needs of an evolving and 
dynamic public education system.
The table below summarizes the Department’s CIP budget proposal.  The means of financing (i.e. 
source of funds) is general obligation bond funds unless otherwise noted.

Conclusion:
The Department appreciates the Legislature’s long standing support for, and investment in, public 
education and is hopeful that the Committee can accommodate our budget requests, including the 
latest request for school food services.
The State’s commitment to public education is enshrined in the State Constitution, Article X, 
Section 1:  “The State shall provide for the establishment, support and control of a statewide system 
of public schools . . . .”
The Reinventing Education Act of 2004 recognized that many responsibilities are laid upon 
education.
“. . . ultimately education must do no less than advance the endowment of human culture itself, so 

that each succeeding generation finds itself further along the road towards peace, social justice, 
and environmental sustainability in a society guided by creativity, compassion, and curiosity.”
The mission of the Department of Education is to develop the academic achievement, character 
development, and social-emotional well-being of our students.  We are deeply committed to working 
alongside our families, communities, and stakeholders to ensure that every student can achieve their 
aspirations — from early learning to post-secondary education and citizenship.  This mission is at the 
heart of every decision we make and is the foundation of our proposed budget.
Thank you for the opportunity to testify and for your continued support of public education.

Before the 
HOUSE COMMITTEE ON FINANCE 
March 05, 2025 at 9:00 a.m. 
State Capitol, Room 308 
In consideration of 
H.B. 300 
RELATING TO THE STATE BUDGET. 
Chair Yamashita, Vice Chair Takenouchi, and members of the Committee.   
HHFDC supports HB 300, which appropriates funds for the operating and capital 
improvement budget of the Executive Branch for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-
2027. 
HHFDC requests the committee's consideration of the following for the biennium (unless 
otherwise noted): 
$40,000,000 (MOF: C) for BED 160 Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund Infusion, 
Statewide 
 
The Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund (DURF) may be used for the acquisition of real 
property; development and construction of residential, commercial, and industrial 
properties; interim and permanent loans to developers; development of regional 
infrastructure; and all things necessary to carry out the purposes of HHFDC’s Housing 
Development Program, including administrative expenses.  
 
The $40,000,000 infusion will provide additional financing resources to support the 
development of workforce and affordable housing statewide, as well as infrastructure 
improvements, including but not limited to, interim loans for affordable housing projects, 
infrastructure improvements in Transient-Oriented Development areas that support 
affordable housing projects, rehabilitating infrastructure in the Villages of Kapolei for 
dedication to the City, development of a new potable water system for the Waiahole 

 
 
 
Valley community, continued development of the Leialii (Maui) master planned 
community, and planning and development of the Iwilei Master Plan.  
 
This infusion also includes rehabilitating the Front Street Apartments and other 
infrastructure needs on Maui. 
 
$100,000,000 (MOF: C) for BED 160 Cash Infusion for Rental Housing Revolving 
Fund, Statewide 
 
The Rental Housing Revolving Fund (RHRF) provides loans or grants for development, 
pre-development, construction, acquisition, preservation, and substantial rehabilitation 
of rental housing units. The state has a severe shortage of housing, and the $100 
million infusion is needed to continue to provide gap financing for the development of 
affordable rental housing projects.  The need for RHRF is based on the demand 
exhibited during our 2025 (FY2026) financing application round. There were 31 
applications for RHRF financing in the current round for a total requested amount of 
$1.19 billion. The trends experienced in the current economic environment of rising 
interest rates in the private capital market, rising cost of labor, construction materials, 
and insurance have increased the need for additional financing as the 
developer equity gap increases.  
 
$150,000,000 (MOF: C) for BED 160 Cash Infusion for Tier II Rental Housing Revolving 
Fund, Statewide 
 
RHRF Tier II provides financing for workforce rental projects targeting households 
earning between 60% and 140% of the AMI. This population includes households that 
earn too much to qualify for Low-Income Housing Tax Credit projects but 
not enough to buy their own homes. This group represents our workforce, such as 
teachers, firefighters, and nurses, and affordable housing for this group has been 
identified as a priority for the State. This group has been identified as the largest 
segment leaving Hawaii due to the lack of affordable housing. The $150 million is critical 
to address the housing needs of this population as quickly as possible. 
 
BUDGET ADJUSTMENTS:  
 
HHFDC requests ceiling increases by $356,200 for FY 2026 and $185,200 for FY 2027 
for Other Current Expenses (OCE), with revolving funds as the means of financing 
(MOF W):  
 
$73,600 for FY 2026 and $73,600 for FY 2027 for Maui Travel 
As the lead agency for the housing recovery support function on Maui, HHFDC staff will 
be required to take frequent trips to Maui for meetings with Maui officials, site visits, and 
planning and development meetings. 
 
$231,000 for FY 2026 and $60,000 in FY 2027 for Financing Application Software 
The Housing Finance branch of HHFDC reviews applications from developers and 
facilitates funding and tax credit awards to affordable housing projects. This software 
would reduce staff’s time spent to input, score, and analyze data and produce reports 

 
 
 
that are currently done manually. This may make it possible to hold additional funding 
application rounds if funds and/or resources are available.  
 
The $171,000 ceiling increase in FY 2026 is for non-recurring financing application 
software implementation costs including loading all the historical data into the software 
program. The $60,000 recurring cost for FY2027 is for maintenance, support, and 
updates of the software application.  
 
$21,600 for FY 2026 and $21,600 for FY 2027 for Artificial Intelligence Licenses 
Hawaii is in a housing shortage crisis along with an ever-increasing workload, HHFDC 
is looking to implement cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) technology to increase the 
efficiency and effectiveness of staff's time and productivity. Copilot licenses for Microsoft 
365 will help boost employee productivity by automating redundant tasks, assisting with 
document and email drafting, and providing quick insights using natural language 
queries (GPT). Its integration with Microsoft SharePoint can enhance collaboration by 
making it easier to find relevant documents, track changes, and maintain version control 
across HHFDC's branches and sections. It will also help to build up HHFDC's model to 
create a learning, query-able AI that is specific to HHFDC's core functions; Copilot can 
generate summaries of SharePoint documents, facilitate project updates, and ensure 
that everyone is aligned.  
 
$30,000 for FY 2026 and $30,000 for FY 2027 for Staff Training 
It is essential for HHFDC staff to attend training workshops and conferences for new 
programs and best practices, to stay abreast with updates on housing programs (i.e., 
funding opportunities, Internal Revenue tax codes, Fair Housing), and an important 
aspect for employee retention and succession planning.  
 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify on this bill.

Chair Yamashita, Vice Chair Takenouchi and Members of the Committee on 
Finance.   
 
 
 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify in strong support of House Bill 300, 
which provides the ceiling increase for the Stadium Development Special Fund (SDSF) 
for FY2026 to allow Stadium Authority (BED180/SA) to allot and expend the $49.5M 
funds appropriated in Act 248, Session Laws of Hawaii 2022 and by proviso 17.3 
authorized the deposit of $49.5M appropriation into the SDSF.  
 
 
The ceiling increase will provide SA with a great amount of flexibility to utilize 
these funds to support the New Aloha Stadium Entertainment District (NASED) project.  
 
 
Additionally, the increase in SDSF ceiling will allow SA to contribute to the 
NASED project’s long-term sustainability, ensuring its continued success and positive 
impact on the Hawai’i’s communities.   
 
 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify in support of House Bill 300. 
 

TESTIMONY OF 
THE DEPARTMENT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 
 
 
ON THE FOLLOWING MEASURE: 
H.B. NO. 300, RELATING TO THE STATE BUDGET. 
 
BEFORE THE:

TESTIFIER(S): 
Anne E. Lopez, Attorney General, or  
Matthew S. Dvonch, First Deputy Attorney General 
 
 
Chair Yamashita and Members of the Committee:
The Department of the Attorney General (Department) strongly supports this bill, 
specifically, those appropriations within the budget that provide funding for the 
continued operations of the Department for fiscal biennium 2025-2027. 
Included in the Department’s budget for fiscal years 2026 and 2027 are critical 
requests to convert the funding of four currently-staffed Investigator positions in the 
Investigations Division’s Sex Offender Registration Unit from federal funds to general 
funds; salary adjustments for deputy attorneys general to recruit and retain talented 
attorneys and maintain the Department’s competitive position against similar public and 
private sector employers; and an increase to the Department’s line-item budget for 
litigation expenses given the continuing trend of rising litigation costs.  The 
Department’s budget also includes a number of housekeeping adjustments, such as 
trade-off/transfers and increased fringe costs for non-general funded programs to better 
align the Department’s budget with its programmatic and organizational structure. 
Finally, the Department’s budget includes a request to relocate and house the 
physical servers of the Hawai‘i Criminal Justice Data Center due to the 
decommissioning of the current State-operated Kalanimoku location, as well as 
requests from the administratively attached Hawai‘i Correctional System Oversight 
Commission (HCSOC).  For the HCSOC’s budget requests, the Department defers to 
the testimony of the HCSOC, which is submitted independently from the Department.

Re: 
HB 300 support 
 
Aloha, Honorable Chair Yamashita, Vice-chair Takenouchi, and members of the House Finance 
committee: 
 
The Early Learning Board (ELB) formulates statewide policy relating to early learning, as well as 
directing the Executive Office on Early Learning (EOEL).   
 
The Early Learning Board supports HB 300 which includes funding for 50 additional EOEL Pre-
kindergarten classrooms across the state for the next biennium.  This is a priority for the Early 
Learning Board.   
 
The board also approved the EOEL request for funding for four additional family-child interaction 
learning (FCIL) programs.  This did not make it into HB 300.  However, the board is hopeful that 
funds permitting, this request could be accommodated.  FCIL programs are an important option 
for families.  They provide age-appropriate activities for keiki and information on promoting 
optimal child development for the adult caregiver, strengthening families and their support 
systems in the process.   
 
Mahalo for your consideration of this request. 
 
Respectfully,

RELATING TO THE STATE BUDGET  
COMMITTEE ON FINANCE  
REP. KYLE T. YAMASHITA, CHAIR 
REP. JENNA TAKENOUCHI, VICE CHAIR 
 
Testimony of Caroline Cadirao 
Director, Executive Office on Aging 
Attached Agency to the Department of Health 
 
Hearing: Wednesday, March 5, 2025, 9:00 A.M., Conference Room 308   
EOA Position: The Executive Office on Aging (EOA), an attached agency to the Department of 
1 
Health (DOH) strongly supports HB300, which outlines EOA’s operating budget as outlined in 
2 
the Program Appropriations, HTH 904, Page 36 Item No. 25.  
3 
Fiscal Implications:  Appropriates funds for the EOA’s operating budget for fiscal year 2025-
4 
2026 and for fiscal year 2026-2027.  
5 
Purpose and Justification: EOA’s operating budget includes a supplemental budget request for 
6 
three-line items:  
7 
1) Establish three (3) full-time permanent staff positions within the State Health Insurance 
8 
Assistance Program (SHIP); 2) Transfer three (3) new full-time civil service positions from 
9 
temporary to permanent within the Senior Medicare Patrol (SMP) program; and 3) Convert one 
10 
new full-time civil service position from temporary to permanent.   
11 

HB300 
Page 2 of 3 
 
 
1) Establish three (3) full-time permanent staff positions (Program Specialist V, 
1 
Program Specialist IV, and Program Specialist III) within the State Health 
2 
Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP);  
3 
The additional three (3) FTEs, permanent staff are needed to expand SHIP and increase 
4 
access to enrollment assistance for programs that can offset medical and prescription drug 
5 
costs such as premiums, deductibles, copayments, coinsurance, or lifetime late enrollment 
6 
penalties that are deducted directly from social security benefits.  Without these 
7 
additional staff positions, less Medicare beneficiaries will be reached through education, 
8 
outreach and one to one Medicare counseling.  
9 
2) Transfer three (3) new full-time civil service positions from temporary to permanent 
10 
positions (Program Specialist V, Program Specialist IV, and Program Specialist III) 
11 
within the Senior Medicare Patrol (SMP);  
12 
Act 250, passed in the 2023 legislative session, established three (3) full-time staff 
13 
positions for the Hawai‘i SMP to protect kūpuna from frauds and scams.  Converting 
14 
these three (3) temporary, civil service positions to permanent, will ensure EOA can 
15 
provide timely, reliable, and accurate services.  SMP provides a statewide toll-free 
16 
helpline, provides 1:1 counseling and referrals and conducts community outreach to 
17 
underserved groups and communities to expand access and assistance for Medicare, 
18 
Medicaid, and other health related scams, fraud, or abuse.  If the positions are not 
19 
converted and funded in subsequent years, EOA will be unable to maintain the education, 
20 
outreach and counseling.  The number of older adults who will be victimized will rise 
21 
proportionately with the growing aging population in Hawai’i.  
22 

HB300 
Page 3 of 3 
 
 
3) Convert the Long-Term Care Planner position from temporary to permanent. 
1 
ACT 159, passed in the 2024 legislative session, provides for a Long-Term Care Planner 
2 
(LTC) planner within the EOA to address the serious nature of LTC in Hawai‘i. This ACT 
3 
will ensure our kupuna have the opportunity for optimal health and well-being through a 
4 
comprehensive Long-Term Care plan for Hawai‘i. Converting the 1.0 FTE position from 
5 
temporary to permanent, will enable EOA to move the LTC plan forward, increasing 
6 
awareness for a sustainable system of care throughout Hawai‘i.  Without a dedicated staff 
7 
person to support the planning, policy, and advocacy to move forward the strategies and 
8 
objectives, we will be delayed in addressing this critical issue for the community.  
9 
Additionally, this can impact the costs of care and a reduction in options for home and 
10 
community-based services.  
11 
We appreciate your consideration of this bill. 
12 
Recommendation:  EOA strongly supports this measure and respectfully requests your support 
13 
of  EOA’s operating budget.   
14 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify.

Testimony Presented Before the

By 
Kalbert K. Young 
Vice President for Budget and Finance/Chief Financial Officer 
University of Hawai‘i System 
HB 300 – RELATING TO THE STATE BUDGET 
Chair Yamashita, Vice Chair Takenouchi, and Members of the Committee: 
Thank you for the opportunity to present testimony today.  The University of 
Hawai‘i (UH) supports HB 300, Relating to the State Budget.  This bill appropriates 
funds for the operating and capital improvement budget of the Executive Branch for 
fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027. 
 
Many departments in state government are going to be financially impacted given 
projected reductions in federal funding support for a number of programs and 
personnel.  The UH is looking at a number of programs that are already at risk.  Many of 
them represent reductions in public services to our students, organizations, and our 
broader state community through research and other grant support.  Given the dynamic 
situation, the UH’s budget request does not include any funding request in these 
shortfall areas. 
 
The following table provides the items included in UH’s portion of the Governor’s 
operating budget requested, as provided in his December submittal and as amended by 
Governor’s Message No. 4 (GM4).

The Hawai‘i Technology Development Corporation (HTDC) strongly SUPPORTS 
HB300, which adjusts and requests appropriations for fiscal biennium 2025-2026 funding 
requirements for operations and capital improvement projects of Executive Branch agencies and 
programs. 
 
In addition, this bill also includes allocation of funds for awards through HTDC, to assist 
businesses in applying for the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Grant Program, and 
the Manufacturing Assistance Program (MAP). HTDC is dedicated to initiatives that promote 
economic diversification and sustainable development, while fostering technology advancement 
and business growth. These efforts ultimately contribute to economic stability for Hawai‘i’s 
small to medium-sized businesses.  
 
Small Business Innovation Research Program (HSBIR) 
HTDC has been providing Phase I matching grants to Small Business Innovation 
Research (SBIR) awarded companies since 1989 and started awarding Phase II and Phase III 
matching grants in FY16. A summary of the Phase II/III awards made by the matching grant 
program is listed below: 
 
 
 
The data indicates a consistent upward trend in the Federal funding awarded to the 
industry annually. Federal SBIR funds are highly competitive, with a fixed budget allocated each

year. Consequently, the industry is securing federal funds for Hawai‘i that might otherwise be 
awarded to companies in other states. Each year, the number of qualified applicants exceeds the 
available funding. Since the Phase II/III program's inception in FY16, no applicant has received 
the full eligible amount. Over time, this program is expected to produce similar success metrics 
as the Phase I matching program. 
 
 Manufacturing Development Program (MAP) 
HTDC has been providing MAP matching grants to manufacturers since FY16. A 
summary of the awards made by the matching grant program is listed below: 
 
 
 
Every year, there have been more qualified applicants than available funds. The funding  
awarded to companies provides a partial reimbursement (20%) for equipment upgrades and other  
eligible expenses. Through our federally funded INNOVATE Hawai‘i program, HTDC provides  
wrap-around support services for the matching grants to help Hawai‘i manufacturers become 
more globally competitive.  
 
Hawai‘i manufacturers play an important role in our economy, for food-security,  
sustainability, resilience initiatives, and is an important driver for innovation. The bill aims to 
increase workforce productivity and wages by expanding the definition of skilled workforce 
training as an eligible expense for the MAP Grant program.  
 
HTDC firmly believes that these grant programs play a crucial role in leveraging 
resources and fostering positive economic development throughout the State of Hawai‘i which 
will lead to job creation, sustainable development, and a more resilient and diverse economy for 
Hawai‘i. Thank you for your consideration of supporting this bill.

Dear Representative Yamashita, and Committee members: 
 
SUBJECT: HB 300 RELATING TO THE STATE BUDGET   
The Hawaii State Council on Developmental Disabilities supports HB300, which 
Appropriates funds for the operating and capital improvement budget of the Executive Branch 
for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027. Specifically,

This appropriation amount in HB300 provides the Council with current staffing and fiscal 
resources in order to implement 2022-2026 State Plan activities in the areas of community 
supports; health and children and youth; public awareness, education and training; transition 
and employment; and self-advocacy/self-determination.  
 
Activities include policy development, policy implementation, and analysis; informing 
and educating policymakers about Intellectual/Developmental Disabilities (I/DD); establishing 
networks and coalitions on specific issues and concerns relating to developmental disabilities; 

Representative Yamashita

conducting legislative advocacy training; providing leadership training; demonstrating new 
approaches to services and supports; fostering interagency collaboration and communication; 
coordinating and sponsoring the annual Day at the Capitol, transition events, and neighbor 
island of Oahu legislative forums, etc.  
Without appropriate resources and support systems for individuals with intellectual or 
developmental disabilities (I/DD), the consequences can be significant for individuals, families, 
and the broader community. With limited access to community-based services, more 
individuals may be placed in institutional settings rather than supported in living independently, 
leading to increased costs and limiting personal growth and inclusion. A lack of employment 
and educational opportunities creates further barriers to independence, increasing reliance on 
caregivers and social services, which places additional strain on families. In some cases, 
family members may be forced to leave the workforce to provide care, impacting household 
stability and reducing the overall workforce. 
Additionally, gaps in essential services such as healthcare, housing, and transportation 
can lead to higher rates of emergency medical care, hospitalizations, and long-term 
dependency on costly care systems. The absence of adequate support also impacts the 
workforce shortages in healthcare and caregiving, as more individuals would require 
assistance without enough trained professionals to meet the demand. Without strong programs 
and services that promote inclusion, independence, and accessibility, individuals with I/DD are 
at risk of being left behind, leading to cycles of dependency rather than empowerment. 
Ensuring that essential services remain in place benefits not just individuals with I/DD, but 
strengthens the entire community by promoting a more inclusive and sustainable future for all.  
Thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony in support of HB300, relating to the 
specific budget items noted below. 
 
Sincerely,

Executive Branch for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027. The Kaho‘olawe Island Reserve 
Commission (KIRC) supports this measure. 
The Kaho‘olawe Island Reserve Commission respectfully request the addition of Capitol 
Improvement Project (CIP) funding for its Project A01A: Kaho‘olawe Restoration and 
Resilience Center, Maui (Phase 2), LNR908 in the amount of $4,250,00 (Planning: $350,000; 
Design: $3,000,000; Construction: $900,000). 
The KIRC has the unique opportunity to build the Kaho‘olawe Restoration and Resilience Center 
at its base yard property located adjacent to the Kīhei Small Boat Harbor.  This project will not 
only consolidate and provide a single KIRC office on Maui but will also tell the story of 
Kaho‘olawe’s cultural significance, its ecological devastation and the efforts to restore and 
demonstrate our communities’ resiliency to heal the damages of the past. Additionally, this 
facility will also create a revenue generating venue in the South Kīhei corridor to assist in Maui’s 
economic recovery, generate additional tax revenues and create income opportunities for the 
KIRC to fund restoration efforts on Kaho‘olawe.  
Phase 2 of the project is to develop the detailed drawings and plans necessary to build this 
project.  This includes final construction drawings and specifications, planning and development 
of exhibits and archive storage, final planning, design for office layout, and final design of the 
building infrastructure (HVAC, network). 
Additionally, this request includes construction efforts to expand the current boathouse to 
include a larger concrete pad and two additional covered wings for additional boat storage as 
well as creating a small educational pavilion and restroom facilities adjacent to the current 
boathouse.

Conference Room 308, State Capitol 
 
On behalf of the Hawaiʻi State Commission on the Status of Women, I would like to thank the committee for 
hearing this important bill.  I would like to express my strong support of HB 300 and the continued funding of 
the Hawaiʻi State Commission on the Status of Women (HSCSW). 
 
In light of the current federal administrative priorities and active measures: to dissuade and disrupt gender 
equity policies1; to reduce or eliminate funding for survivor advocacy2 and gender-based violence prevention 
education3; and to promote regressive gender roles4,5; ongoing state budgetary support of the Commission 
on the Status of Women is especially needed and greatly appreciated. 
 
The HSCSW was created by executive order on May 15, 1964, to function as a central clearinghouse of 
resources, services and advocacy for women and girls.  The Commission engages in legislative advocacy and 
implementation, develops programs, collaborates with community organizations and state departments, 
provides field placements for students, delivers trainings and technical assistance, and serves as an 
informational resource for Hawaiʻi’s women and girls, on a broad range of policies and issues. 
 
I respectfully urge this Committee to pass HB 300.  Thank you for your consideration and this opportunity to 
submit testimony in support of the continued funding of the Commission on the Status of Women.

House Bill 300, Relating to the State Budget 
 
Dear Chair Yamashita, Vice Chair Takenouchi, and Members of the Committee: 
 
The School Facilities Authority (SFA) strongly supports House Bill 300, which 
appropriates funds for the operating and capital improvement budget of the Executive 
Branch for fiscal years 2025-2026. 
 
SFA focuses on building modern learning spaces for public schools and contemporary living 
environments for workforce housing on public lands through improved government 
processes that maximize the long-term value of our projects while accelerating their 
completion time. SFA has three main initiatives: expansion of preschools, a new Central 
Maui school, and workforce housing.  
 
SFA asks the committee to approve two capital improvement program requests in Governor 
Josh Green’s executive budget, $100 million for a new Central Maui school (EDN450 Item 
No. G-14) and $12 million for education workforce housing (EDN450 Item No. G-15). 
 
Thank you for this opportunity to testify. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Riki Fujitani 
Executive Director

Chair Yamashita, Vice Chair Takenouchi, and Members of the Committee: 
 
Measure: 
H.B. No. 300 
Title: 
RELATING TO THE STATE BUDGET. 
 
Position: 
 
The Public Utilities Commission (“Commission”) strongly supports this measure and 
offers the following comments for consideration. 
 
Comments: 
 
The Commission is in strong support of this Administration measure that appropriates 
funds for the operating and capital improvement budget of the Executive Branch for fiscal 
years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027. 
 
First, the Commission seeks a one-time appropriation ceiling increase of $1 million (Fiscal 
Year 2025-2026) for consultant services and contracts for Wildfire related services.  Since 
the August 2023 Maui Wildfires, the Commission has taken many initiatives in response 
to the growing threat of wildfires and other natural hazards to the State. The Commission 
is currently engaged in efforts to strengthen critical infrastructure, mitigate risks, protect 
utility customers, and ensure resilient recovery after extreme weather events.  For 
example, the Commission has required regulated utilities to submit natural hazard 
mitigation plans. In January, the Commission opened a docket proceeding to review 
Hawaiian Electric’s (“HECO”) wildfire mitigation plan (filed on January 10, 2025) and plans 
to open a docket proceeding to review Kauai Island Utility Cooperative’s wildfire mitigation 
plan that was filed on January 28, 2025.  
 
The Commission will require technical advice on many aspects, including but not limited 
to, natural hazard (including wildfire) mitigation plans, resilience and reliability of electric 
utility services, and utility organization. 
 

H.B. No. 300 
Page 2 
 
 
 
 
Second, the Commission is requesting two critical positions: an Engineer V and an 
Auditor V.  The Engineer V is required for implementing Act 166, Session Laws of Hawaii 
2012, where the Hawaii State Legislature created new sections under Chapter 269, 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (“HRS”), which provides a framework for the establishment of a 
Hawaii Electricity Reliability Administrator (“HERA”). Pursuant to HRS § 269-142, the 
HERA’s scope also includes non-utility entities that operate on electric systems (i.e., 
independent power providers, ancillary service providers, etc.). In addition, due to the 
high cost of contracting for these services, the Commission plans to move HERA forward 
by contracting an outside consultant to be the HERA for a 12- to 18-month period.  During 
that time, the consultant will train Commission Engineering Staff, including the new 
Engineer V, to perform the HERA duties, which builds much-needed engineering capacity 
and expertise within the Commission, as well as lowers administration costs. 
 
The Auditor V is necessary due to the significant increase in utility rate cases, and the 
Commission expects this trend to continue primarily from private water and wastewater 
companies, as well as water carriers. In addition, the Auditor V will provide support for 
issues related to renewable portfolio standards and the impacts of the wildfires that have 
increased the number of priority dockets that address HECO’s financial stability and rate 
payer affordability.  In 2024, 11 new rate cases were added in addition to the 6 rate cases 
that are still pending for a total of 17 rate cases, which includes the ongoing HECO 
Companies Performance Base Ratemaking docket.   
 
Furthermore, the Legislature is currently considering multiple bills affecting the electric 
utilities that will require specialized expertise in the planning and implementation of any 
new laws.  The ceiling increase will be helpful for the Commission in other areas as well 
with the growing threat of storm-related power outages, grid restoration and preparation 
for rebuilding Maui’s infrastructure, and direct impacts of other natural disasters to the 
State.   
 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify on this measure.

 LNR 405:  Add $1,250,000 in general obligation bond funds for FY26 to supplement the 
$1,000,000 FY24 CIP appropriation, ensuring sufficient funding during the land acquisition 
process. 
 
 LNR 405:  Add $1,200,000 in general obligation bond funds for FY26 for the design of the new 
DOCARE substation facility and related work. 
 
The Department offers the following, additional comments: 
 
 The Department’s mission is to enhance, protect, conserve, and manage Hawaiʻi’s unique and 
limited natural, cultural, and historic resources held in public trust for current and future 
generations of the people of Hawaiʻi nei, and its visitors, in partnership with others from the 
public and private sectors.  
 
 Projects were selected and prioritized based on wildfire recovery, public safety, compliance, and 
public trust resource protection, in accordance with statutory mandates that guide the 
Department’s vision, mission, goals and objectives to manage resources for the benefit of the 
public, and to protect the resources and the public.

Facing potential reductions or losses in federal discretionary funding, DLNR has assessed its federally 
funded positions and respectfully request consideration of an adjustment in the budget to convert select
DLNR positions currently funded by discretionary federal funds (MOF P) to a more stable funding 
source, MOF A, which is the general funds or MOF N, where feasible.
Given the uncertainty of federal funding, conversion to MOF A is preferred by DLNR to ensure 
continued program stability and workforce security.  This conversion will increase the capacity of these 
positions to perform other duties which are not currently performed due to the limitations associated 
with federal grant requirements – federal aid policy requires expenditures be identifiable and allocable
to a particular federal award and incurred specifically for a particular federal grant.  Additionally,
general funded positions are recoverable indirect costs.
Typically, MOF N funding is formula-based and not subject to the same discretionary appropriations 
risks as MOF P funding, which often relies on competitive grants. This adjustment is a cost-neutral 
measure and a prudent contingency, although this type of conversion limits the position’s proficiency 
and expertise to be used to the extent they are directly and exclusively related to the specific federal
grant program, allowable and allocable to the particular grant only.  This is also subject to funding
reductions, as the amount allocated to each recipient is based on a set formula that is determined by 
federal legislation, which can be amended to decrease overall funding or change the calculation factors,
leading to lower grant amounts for recipients depending on the new formula. 
Additionally, given the importance of the work provided by these positions, we are requesting to
convert the two (2) positions identified below from temporary to permanent. This conversion will 
reduce employee turnover and improve retention, thus providing the needed stability and staff 
continuity.

DLNR has identified the following positions that could be converted under this request:
DLNR recommends the conversion of these positions to MOF A, to allow us to continue to operate and 
manage our program objectives under anticipated budget constraints, and as a secondary option, to 
convert them to MOF N.  In addition to changing the means of financing, we are recommending the 
conversion of two (2) temporary positions to permanent.
We respectfully request that this adjustment be reflected in the budget to support DLNR’s ability to 
manage its workforce effectively and ensure continuity of services. Please contact me at (808) 587-0402

State Capitol, Conference Room 308 
 
In consideration of 
HB300, RELATING TO THE STATE BUDGET 
 
  
Chair Yamashita, Vice Chair Takenouchi, and the members of the committee:  
  
The purpose of HB300 is to appropriate funds for the operating and capital improvement 
budget of the Executive Branch for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027.   
 
The Department of Human Resources Development (HRD) strongly supports HB300 
as it relates to our biennium budget requests.

Description of Request 
Payroll Adjustments. Funding is required to address: 
1) Collective Bargaining Adjustments.  Salaries for filled positions have increased over 
time, while the budgeted salaries for vacant positions have not kept pace. 
2) Advancement and retention of employees.  Without adequate funding, HRD will be 
unable to adjust salaries as employees advance in their classification series, which 
will significantly hinder career progression.   
3) Addressing Salary Disparities for Excluded Managerial (EM) positions to align with 
the middle of the collective bargaining schedule, which will better position HRD to 
retain qualified managers and prevent turnover. 
4) Minimizing Turnover and Addressing Workforce Attrition, amid a significant number 
of Executive branch employees becoming eligible for retirement. 
5) Sustaining Recruitment Success.

Description of Request 
HRD SAAS Cost Increases.  HRD's Software as a Service (SAAS) applications costs 
have increased dramatically.  SAAS systems are rising at approximately $70-80K per 
year.  Costs have eclipsed HRD's operating budget.  This funding request is essential.  
If not adequately addressed, HRD will not have sufficient funds for operations. 
 
The request will support increasing costs for HRD's NeoGov (recruitment, 
onboarding), Human Resources Management System (HRMS), and Adobe Learning 
Manager (ALM for training content).  These systems serve as the enterprise-wide 
foundation for the HR and payroll operations of the Executive Branch.

Description of Request 
Add 2.00 Positions and Funds for PTO (Employee Records and Transactions). The 
requested 2.00 FTE HRMS Analyst positions are currently temporary, exempt from 
civil service, and funded with ARPA funds.  Without these positions, the maintenance 
of the centralized, comprehensive employee information system within the Executive 
Branch will remain inefficient and staff will continue to be inundated with mundane 
tasks.  Most importantly, we would jeopardize timely and accurate processing of 
employees' pay, benefits and employment security.  The HRMS Analyst positions are 
working to review legacy processes and provide recommendations to maximize the 
efficiency and effectiveness of HR components within HIP, as well as explore other 
opportunities to integrate systems.  These positions will also play an essential role in 
the EFS and ERP projects.

Description of Request 
Add 6.00 Positions and Funds for ESD (Employee Staffing Division Recruitment and 
Outreach).  The request to institutionalize the 6.00 ESD FTEs as permanent positions 
will ensure progress made in recruiting efforts remain intact.  5.00 of the 6.00 
positions are currently exempt from civil service, temporary, and funded with ARPA 
funds.  This team has enhanced recruitment and certification capabilities within ESD, 
enabling the State to more effectively meet its workforce needs.  Without this funding 
and resources, the ESD remains constrained in its ability to attract and retain top-tier 
talent, affecting the State's ability to deliver critical public services effectively. 
 
1.00 (Human Resources Technician VI) of the 6.00 positions will support the 
Certification section within ESD.  Certification provides front-end and back-end 
support for all requested recruitments for civil service vacancies.  Currently, there are 
only 1.00 professional and 3.00 paraprofessional staff managing over 1500 
requisitions annually.

research, publications on latest trends and other resources beneficial for HRD as the 
Executive Branch's HR authority. 
2) $2,250 Pay Equity Training. 
3) $72,150 for compensation analytics and salary survey data.  This system will save 
time and increase accuracy when conducting wage comparisons that are currently 
done manually using excel spreadsheets. 
 
Approximately $70,000 in expenditures will be supplemented with ARPA funds in

Testimony Presented Before the

March 5, 2025 at 9:00 a.m., Room 308 and Via Video Conference 
by 
T. Samuel Shomaker, MD, Dean 
and 
Lee Buenconsejo-Lum, MD, Associate Dean for Academic Affairs  
John A. Burns School of Medicine 
University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa 
 
HB 300 – RELATING TO THE STATE BUDGET 
Chair Yamashita, Vice Chair Takenouchi, and members of the Committee: 
Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony in SUPPORT of HB 300, specifically 
as it relates to the John A. Burns School of Medicine’s (JABSOM) line item 110 and the  
additional state funding to ensure full coverage of JABSOM’s Kakaʻako Health & 
Wellness revenue bond debt service payments. Full debt service coverage will mitigate 
potential medical school accreditation status forfeitures if future Tobacco Master 
Settlement Agreement (MSA) annual allocations to UH continue to decline.  The funding 
requested in HB 300 for the debt service is $1.1M for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $1.5M 
for fiscal year 2026-2027. 
 
From the opening of the JABSOM Kakaʻako Health and Wellness campus in 2005, the 
Hawaiʻi State Legislature has awarded a portion of Hawaii's annual MSA funding to 
cover the medical school's Kakaʻako Health and Wellness campus revenue bond debt 
service. The National Association of Attorneys General (NAAG), who oversees the 
U.S.'s Tobacco MSA, predicted that the annual MSA payments to the participating 
states would decline over time.  MSA payment levels are affected by U.S. inflation, U.S. 
cigarette and roll-your-own tobacco consumption, and cigarette manufacturers' income. 
NAAG has not published a forecasted future payment schedule; however, a few 
participating states (e.g., Colorado) have forecasted annual MSA state payment 
declines between 3% and 8% in any given year. 
 
In April 2024, the MSA payment to Hawaiʻi of $36,425,172.62 was 11% less than the 
prior year’s payment of $40,862,842.25. Due to this MSA payment reduction, for the first 
time, the medical school’s annual MSA allocation of $8,833,034.88 will not fully cover 
the medical school’s FY2025 bond debt service obligation of $9,395,723 (i.e., a 
shortage of $562,688). The medical school’s Kakaʻako Health and Wellness revenue 
bond debt service payments end on July 1, 2033. 
 
If the April 2025 MSA payment declines by 11% or higher, the medical school will 
be forced to use its tuition allocation. The use of our tuition allocation for debt 
service will reduce faculty and staff personnel due to the lack of compensation coverage 
(i.e., it is equivalent to 14 teaching faculty or 27 academic support staff or a combination 

2 
 
of both). Loss of medical school personnel will pose a threat to the medical school’s 
accreditation for its medical students from the Liaison Committee on Medical Education 
(LCME) and accreditation for its MD resident trainee programs from the Accreditation 
Council of Graduate Medical Education (ACGME). Continued accreditation is essential 
to support medical school student enrollment (e.g., all degrees and residency 
programs), research opportunities, community service, health systems support, and the 
medical school’s ability to increase the physician workforce for Hawaiʻi. 
 
JABSOM is training more students than ever before.  Faced with a physician shortage 
of 750 physicians in the state when compared to other continental US jurisdictions, we 
expanded our class size to help meet the worsening doctor shortage.  Our third-year 
medical students now have the option of doing part of their training in Hilo, West Hawai‘i 
and North Hawai‘i, Maui and Kaua‘i.  First-year and fourth-year medical students have 
the opportunity for elective rotations on the islands of Hawai‘i, Maui, Kaua‘i and 
Moloka‘i.  Nearly two thirds of our graduates will remain in Hawai’i to practice medicine, 
one of the nation’s highest retention rates.  These are bold steps taken to realize the 
dream of former Governor Burns to allow Hawai’i’s children to become some of 
Hawai’i’s most valuable citizens, i.e., those who commit their lives to improve the health 
of others. 
 
Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony on this measure.

before the 
HOUSE COMMITTEE ON FINANCE 
Wednesday, March 5, 2025  
9:00 AM 
State Capitol, Conference Room 308 
 
in consideration of 
HB 300 
RELATING TO THE STATE BUDGET 
 
Chair Yamashita, Vice Chair Takenouchi, and Members of the House Committee on 
Finance: 
 
The Office of Planning and Sustainable Development (OPSD) supports HB 300.  This 
appropriates the funds for the OPSD in operating budget of the Executive Branch for fiscal year 
2026. 
Highlights of OPSD’s supplemental budget request includes the following: 
 
• Transfer Out Budget Line Items to BED103 $-786,875; -7.00 Permanent FTE;  
-1.00 Temporary FTE, to promote transparency and accountability to the public 
and to better align two separate programs, Land Use Commission (LUC) and 
Office of Planning and Sustainable Development (OPSD), with their separate 
missions within the state program structure. 
   
• Federal Fund Ceiling Increase of $255,964. Increase CZM appropriation ceiling 
(N) due to Federal Grant continuing support and inflation. 
 
• Add $300,000 General Funds for 1.00 FTE temporary position and funds for 
Special Funds Project Coordinator and administration costs for the second year 
(FY 2026) of the Hawaii State Planning Act Phase 2. Additional funding is 
required to continue this multi-year process to update HRS 226 pursuant to Act 
36, SLH 2024. 
 
• Add 3.00 FTE Temp Pos and Funds in SPB $282,060; 3.00 Temporary FTE for 
filled positions (Pos. Nos. 124200, 124251, and 124288).   
 
o Personnel General Funds are essential to retaining staff who support the 
state’s Economic Development District (EDD) designation, which unlocks 

 
 
 
 
additional federal funding and enhances economic development and 
resilience efforts statewide.  
 
o OPSD won’t be able to retain critical SPB staff without General Funds, 
jeopardizing the state’s EDD designation and leading to the loss of 
associated benefits and federal funding opportunities.   
 
• Add General Funds to Restore Full-Year Funding for Permanent Special Plans 
Branch Planning Program Manager, $45,570. 
 
• Add 1.00 FTE and Funds for Statewide Sustainability Branch $35,508 FY26 
$71,016 FY27 to support statewide climate and sustainability 
coordination/implementation. 
 
o Background: - Established by HRS §225M-8 (Act 45, SLH 2020) and 
HRS §225M-2 (b) (9), the Sustainability Branch coordinates and 
implements climate and sustainability policies statewide, evaluates 
legislation, and advises the Governor, Legislature, and agencies on 
sustainability and climate resilience. Currently, the Branch has only 1.00 
FTE (State Sustainability Coordinator). 
 
o Outcome: This request would expand capacity to meet climate resilience 
demands.  While original Form A requested 3 positions to adequately staff 
a Statewide Climate and Sustainability Branch, the Executive Budget 
reduced this request to 1.00 FTE.  Considering the urgent climate 
adaptation demands facing the state, the Branch supports staffing provided 
by 1.00 FTE, but strongly supports the 3.00 FTE request being restored. 
 
• Convert Coastal Zone Management (CZM) Program salaries of 5.00 Permanent 
FTE from MOF N to A Funds:  
o Reduce MOF N by 5.00 FTE and $663,329 
o Increase MOF A by 5.00 FTE and $411,408 
 
o Background: From 1975 to 2009, the positions were general funded. In 
2009, the positions were converted to federal funding following a decline 
in State revenues. The provision of federal funds from NOAA were 
conditioned on the State taking active steps to restore State funding. 
 
o Outcome: Restores general funds for five staff positions, ensuring that 
50% of CZM’s staff positions are funded with State funding to help satisfy 
the condition(s) of the federal cooperative agreement, including one-to-
one match requirements, which maintains the CZM Program’s eligibility 
to receive its annual federal award of approx. $2.5 million.

Honorable Chair Yamashita, Vice Chair Takenouchi, and members of the House Committee on

The Hawaii Public Housing Authority (HPHA) is in strong support of HB 300, which appropriates

economic opportunity, and suitable living environments that are free from discrimination 
through both its public housing and rental assistance programs.  The HPHA serves our state’s 
most disadvantaged populations, including families earning less than thirty percent of the Area 
Median Income, the disabled, and the elderly.

The requested funding will be used to provide monetary incentives and 
reimbursements to landlords who rent to voucher families.  The program 
encourages new and existing landlords to participate in Section 8 by 
providing financial benefits.  Because of the State’s competitive rental 
market, some landlords are reluctant to accept voucher holders 
because of perceived risks or concerns about potential financial 
burdens.  By encouraging more landlords to participate, the program 
expands the pool of available rental units.

Hawaii Correctional System Oversight Commission 
 
SUBJECT:  
House Bill 300, Relating to the State Budget 
 
 
 
Hearing: Wednesday, March 5, 2025; 9:00am 
 
 
 
State Capitol, Room 308 
 
Chair Yamashita, Vice Chair Takenouchi, and Members of the Committee: 
 
The Hawaii Correctional System Oversight Commission (HCSOC, the Commission) supports 
House Bill 300, Relating to the State Budget, as the modest funding increase is essential for 
sustaining and expanding the Commission’s vital oversight work. Through the Attorney General’s 
Office, this bill allocates an increase of $196,863 for FY26 and $271,445 for FY27, allowing the 
Commission to continue fulfilling its statutory mandate and enhance its critical oversight efforts. 
 
In 2019, the Hawaii legislature found that, “independent oversight of the State’s correctional 
system ensures transparency, supports safe conditions for employees, inmates, and detainees, and 
provides positive reform towards a rehabilitative and therapeutic correctional system.” This led to 
the passage of Act 179 of 2019 and the establishment of Chapter 353L in the Hawaii Revised 
Statutes, which tasks the Commission with monitoring the correctional system, investigating 
complaints, setting inmate population limits, and ensuring the effectiveness of offender reentry 
programs. Since its inception in 2020, the Commission has made significant strides, particularly 
with the hiring of dedicated staff and the initiation of vital oversight activities in 2022. 
 
To date, the Commission has conducted over 65 investigative visits to correctional facilities, issued 
more than 55 public reports, and held over 70 public meetings. These efforts have resulted in over 
100 recommendations to the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (DCR), a crucial 
partner in advancing a more rehabilitative and therapeutic corrections system. The implementation 
of these recommendations has already led to tangible improvements, including: 
- 
Ensuring compliance with federal standards, such as proper access to courts, adequate 
bedframes and bunkbeds, appropriate clothing and bedding, access to outdoor recreation, 
and provision of menstrual pads. 
 

Testimony of the Hawaii Correctional System Oversight Commission 
House Bill 300, Relating to the State Budget 
Page 2 of 2 
 
- 
Creating a more therapeutic environment for individuals on suicide watch by painting and 
reconfiguring cells. 
- 
Restoring contact visits to strengthen family ties, which is critical for successful reentry. 
- 
Removing the monetary eligibility requirement for furlough participation at all furlough 
sites, expanding access to rehabilitation opportunities. 
 
To build upon these successes and fully meet its statutory obligations, the Commission is 
respectfully requesting funding for two full-time positions including a Prison Oversight Specialist 
to expand investigative capacity and to fulfill §353L-4(b)(1), and a Research and Policy Associate 
to support data-driven reforms and fulfill §353L-4. Additionally, the Commission is requesting 
funding for a case management system to organize, track, and monitor all complaints and 
recommendations. Lastly, the Commission is requesting additional funding for inter-island and 
mainland correctional facility travel to fulfill §353L-4(b)(1), memberships and conferences to 
fulfill §353L-7, and general operational expenses. 
 
Oversight is imperative to safeguarding the rights and well-being of incarcerated individuals, staff 
members who work in the correctional facilities, and the broader community. Furthermore, by 
ensuring compliance with state and federal regulations, robust oversight reduces the risk of costly 
litigation, ultimately saving taxpayer dollars while fostering a safer and more rehabilitative 
correctional system. Therefore, when evaluating the state of corrections and the allocation of funds 
towards correctional, reentry, and rehabilitative initiatives in Hawaii, the Hawaii Correctional 
System Oversight Commission stands as a pivotal investment for driving systemic transformation.  
 
For all the reasons stated above, the Oversight Commission supports HB300 as it will increase

Statement of  
Daniel E. Orodenker 
Executive Officer 
State Land Use Commission 
 
Before the 
House Committee on Finance 
 
Wednesday March 5, 2025 
9:00 AM 
State Capitol, Room 308 and Video Conference 
 
In consideration of  
HB300 
 
RELATING TO THE STATE BUDGET 
 
 
Chair Yamashita; Vice Chair Takenouchi; and members of the House Committee on Finance: 
 
The proposed measure appropriates funding for the operating and capital improvement budget of the 
Executive Branch for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027, including the operating budget for the State 
Land Use Commission (“LUC”).  The LUC supports this measure and provides the following comments. 
 
The LUC strongly supports efforts to provide affordable workforce housing.  The proposed budget 
for BED103 (Page 55) provides for a continuing position for our Land Use Development Coordinator 
(Position No. 125210) but no funding for the coming two fiscal years.  This position has been extremely 
successful in stimulating housing on projects that have been stalled.  It has assisted in clearing the way for 
1000 homes to break ground in this calendar year and over 13,000 homes in the next 5 years 
 
We ask that the funding for this position be reinstated.  The annual cost of this position is $93,226. 
 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify on this matter.

TESTIMONY ON THE FOLLOWING MEASURE: 
H.B. No. 300, Relating to the State Budget 
 
BEFORE THE: 
House Committee on Finance 
 
 
DATE: 
 
Wednesday, March 5, 2025 
TIME:  
 
9:00 a.m. 
LOCATION:  
State Capitol, Room 308 
 
 
Chair Yamashita, Vice-Chair Takenouchi, and Members of the Committee: 
 
The Department of Taxation (DOTAX) supports H.B. 300, which appropriates 
funds for the operating and capital improvement budget of the Executive Branch for 
fiscal years (FYs) 2025-2026 and 2026-2027. 
 
DOTAX notes the following highlights from the budget to support its operations: 
 
1. Add $338,150 for FY 26 and $1,343,400 for FY 27 for monitoring and 
maintenance of the Tax System Modernization (TSM) project. This request 
covers annual vendor price increases and the replacement of DOTAX's 
scanners, which process paper forms and payments. 
 
2. Establish two permanent positions and add funds ($65,000 for FY 26 and 
$205,000 for FY 27) for a Senior Software Developer and Software Developer 
Supervisor. These positions are part of DOTAX's long-term goal to retain its 
developers and reduce reliance on vendor professional services.  
 
3. Establish one permanent position and add funds ($52,500 for FY 26 and 
$105,000 for FY 27) for a Data Privacy Officer to fulfill the IRS requirement 
that DOTAX appoint a senior agency official responsible for coordinating,

H.B. 300

developing, and implementing privacy requirements and managing privacy 
risks. 
 
4. Establish five permanent positions and add funds ($229,796 for FY 26 and 
$459,592 for FY 27) for a Departmental Program Officer, Program Specialist 
VI, Program Specialist V, Project Manager II, and Tax Business Analyst. 
These positions will be part of DOTAX's TSM Program Team within the Office 
of the Director and will be responsible for overseeing large updates to TSM, 
ensuring updates comply with applicable laws and user needs, interfacing 
with the IRS and other stakeholders, and training DOTAX users and 
taxpayers on TSM changes. The TSM Program Team will be vital in DOTAX's 
efforts to join the IRS Direct File program in 2026.  
 
DOTAX notes that, due to an inadvertent error, the budget includes these five 
positions as part of the Information Technology Services Office (TAX107/AC). 
DOTAX requests that these positions instead be included in the Office of the 
Director (TAX107/AA).  
 
5. Add $100,000 for FY 26 to support the Tax Review Commission for 
necessary activities, including contracts for consultants. (GM 1) 
 
Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments in support of this measure.

HOUSE COMMITTEE ON FINANCE 
 
Hearing Date: March 5, 2025; 9:00 am 
 
 
 
 
Room Number:  308 
 
Fiscal Implications:  Sufficient appropriations are required for the Department of Health (DOH) 
1 
to implement statutory obligations.  Insufficient funding will jeopardize public health at large 
2 
and for vulnerable populations. 
3 
Department Testimony:  The DOH supports HB300, in particular where priorities identified in 
4 
the Governor’s Executive Budget request have been funded at requested levels. 
5 
 
6 
The DOH’s guiding principles include: 
7 
• Implementing and maintaining core public health functions, including assessment, 
8 
policy, and assurance, 
9 
• Satisfying federal mandates, including court-ordered settlements, 
10 
• Directing resources as problems that pose the greatest risk to the public’s health and 
11 
the environment, 
12 
• Dispersing appropriate and cost-effective resources geographically, and 
13 
• Providing services of last resort for uninsurable populations and where there is no other 
14 
satisfactory alternative.

Statement of 
JAMES KUNANE TOKIOKA 
Director 
Department of Business, Economic Development, and Tourism 
before the 
HOUSE COMMITTEE ON FINANCE 
 
Wednesday, March 5, 2025 
9:00 AM 
State Capitol, Conference Room 308 
 
In consideration of  
HB300 
RELATING TO THE STATE BUDGET.  
 
 
Chair Yamashita, Vice Chair Takenouchi and members of the Committee. 
 
The Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism strongly supports 
HB300, which appropriates funds for the operating and capital improvement budget of the 
Executive Branch for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027.  DBEDT kindly requests 
consideration of the following Operating and CIP line items.   
 
 
Operating Requests 
 
Business Development and Support Division (BED100/SM) 
• $1,450,000 each year to be used for the Healthcare Workforce Development 
Program to provide funding for two programs: 1) High School Healthcare 
Workforce Certificate and 2) CNA to LPN Glidepath Program. Funding for the 
High School Certificate Program would address the entry-level healthcare 
workforce shortage by certifying high school students in high-demand healthcare 
professions. The Glidepath Program is an earn-and-learn pathway that further 
addresses the healthcare workforce shortage which enables employers to retain 
employees as they pursue education and career advancement.  
 
 

DBEDT Testimony 
March 5, 2025 
Page 2 
 
 
Office of International Affairs (BED101/IA) 
• $2,000,000 each year to be used for the East-West Center (EWC) to provide 
Hawaii residents with the opportunity to participate in various activities related to 
the Asia-Pacific region.  The East-West Center will expand its outreach activities 
so that an exponential number of Hawaii residents can benefit from the outcomes 
of its work.  Funding would result in EWC’s ability to convene more conferences 
in Honolulu, which will foster an infusion of additional funds into the Hawaii 
economy by individuals who will travel from out of state to participate in its 
conferences. 
 
Land Use Commission (Proposed BED103/DA) 
• 7.00 Permanent FTE; 1.00 Temporary FTE, and $786,875 each year. The Office 
of Planning and Sustainable Development (OPSD) has requested a change to 
the DBEDT program structure to add (restore) BED 103, State Land Use 
Commission, to DBEDT program IDs to promote transparency and accountability 
to the public and to better align two separate programs with their separate 
missions within the state program structure.  This request would transfer all our 
LUC budget line items from BED144 and transfer in to BED103.  This does not 
include the existing Land Use Development Coordinator and request the 
following: 
o $186,456 ($93,226 annually) to allow funding for the existing Land Use 
Development Coordinator position (Position No. 125210) which has been 
instrumental in assisting legacy workforce housing projects to address 
barriers in the development process. 
 
Creative Industries Division (BED105/CI) 
• 1.00 Program Specialist V (FY26: $71,016 / FY27: $71,016). 
Lead position for CID and DBEDT’s primary workforce development liaison, 
integrating industry and education partners, ensuring alignment with the state’s 
economic diversification goals, accelerating job creation and career placement. 
Responsible for department specific industry cluster pipelines development and 
implementation. Key position to represent DBEDT on the Workforce 
Development Council (WDC) and will serve as workforce lead for the Business 
Revitalization Task Force (Permitted Interaction Group – Workforce). 
 
• 1.00 Film Industry Development Specialist V (FY26: $35,508 / FY27: $71,016). 
Restores film permitting statutory position, critical to intra state, inter 
departmental film permitting unit. Reduction of position in SLH 2024 impacts  
productions coming into state, local productions and the inter-departmental 
approval process, as the elimination of position reduced a two person team to 
one position only.

Foreign-Trade Zone (BED107/BA) 
• $120,000 Special Fund ceiling increase each year to allow for the procurement of 
one (1) additional forklift to complete fleet replacement and to cover costs of 
deferred maintenance projects, and other expenses due to inflationary increases.  
 
Hawai‘i Tourism Authority (BED113 – BED118) 
• BED114/BM: $2,773,676 each year. This program globally markets and brands 
the state of Hawai‘i and its islands as a globally competitive leisure and business 
destination to strengthen tourism’s overall contribution to Hawai‘i economy.  HTA 
will continue to be present in the major market areas of U.S., Canada, Japan, 
Korea, Oceania, Europe and China.   In addition, HTA seeks to grow the 
meetings, conventions and incentives (MCI) market.  Demand from domestic and 
international markets is expected to be soft, and there is a continued need for 
activities for quick return generation of demand, such as market saturation 
activations and co-op programs.  Strong marketing is needed to stabilize the 
domestic market and rebuild the international markets. The current FY 25 
marketing budget is only able to maintain interest and awareness levels. 
 
• BED 114/BM: $3,000,000 in FY26 for brand marketing, per Governor’s Message 
4.  There is expected softness further into 2025 and 2026.  Overcoming market 
hesitancy to visit Maui can only be accomplished through continued contact, 
frequent viewership, and relationship building. Activities will focus on short-term 
activities to increase demand, such as coop programs and in-market activations, 
and campaigns to show what to do and see. 
 
• BED 114/BM: $3,000,000 each year for Japan marketing, per Governor’s 
Message 4.  Japan market demand will continue to be down through 2027. 
Activities will focus on short-term activities to increase demand, such as coop 
programs, in-market activations, and campaigns to show what to do and see. 
 
• BED116/DC: $16,086,484 to combine program IDs BED115, BED117, and 
BED118 with BED116 to provide greater synergy for HTA’s newly mandated 
objectives for destination management.  All four programs are aimed at the same 
overall objective.  Consolidating the programs will allow HTA to implement 
destination management cohesively without the additional administrative burden 
required for four separate programs.  
 
Hawai‘i State Energy Office (BED120/SI) 
• $97,095 each year to cover payroll shortfall that was never fully budgeted since 
the creation of the Chief Energy Officer position pursuant to Act 122, SLH2019.  
 
• $54,335 each year for salary adjustments necessitated from the additional 
workload to GF positions from securing 18 new federal awards totaling 
approximately $102 million in federal grants since January of 2023 and adding 11 
new federally funded positions. 

DBEDT Testimony

Hawai‘i Green Infrastructure Authority (BED138/GI) 
• 1.00 Investment Fund Manager (FY 26: $211,150 / FY 27: $217,485) in special 
funds to include position #125606 (authorized by Act 40, SLH 2024) in HGIA’s 
base budget. 
 
Director’s Office (BED142/AA) 
• 1.00 Sports Tourism Manager and funds of $149,000 each year. This position will 
play a vital role in promoting Hawai‘i as a premier sports tourism destination. The 
position will be responsible for developing and implementing marketing strategies 
that attract sporting events, athletes, and spectators to the Hawaiian Islands. 
Further, this position is critical to promote sport events and activities within the 
State of Hawai‘i and to establish and continue sports networking with our sister 
states, like Las Vegas, California, and others. 
 
Hawai‘i Technology Development Corporation (BED143/TE) 
• $1,000,000 each year for the Manufacturing Assistance Program and Hawai‘i 
Small Business Innovation Research Program.  HTDC firmly believes that these 
grant programs play a crucial role in leveraging resources and fostering positive 
economic development throughout the State of Hawai‘i which will lead to job 
creation, sustainable development, and a more resilient and diverse economy for 
Hawai‘i. 
 
Office of Planning and Sustainable Development (BED144) 
• BED144/DA – Transfer out 7.00 Permanent FTE; 1.00 Temporary FTE, and 
$786,875 each year to BED103/DA. The Office of Planning and Sustainable 
Development (OPSD) has requested a change to the DBEDT program structure 
to add (restore) BED 103, State Land Use Commission (LUC), to DBEDT 
program IDs to promote transparency and accountability to the public and to 
better align two separate programs with their separate missions within the state 
program structure. 
 
• BED144/PZ - $255,964 each year for Coastal Zone Management Federal Fund 
Ceiling Increase. Increase appropriation ceiling due to Federal Grant continuing 
support and inflation. 
 
• BED144/PL - 1.00 Special Funds Project Coordinator and administration costs  
for the second year (FY 2026) of the Hawaii State Planning Act Phase 2. 
Additional funding is required to continue this multi-year process to update HRS 
226 pursuant to Act 36, SLH 2024. 
 
• BED144/PL – 3.00 exempt, filled, temporary FTE and $282,060 each year.  
Personnel funds are needed to retain staff to continue to support an Economic 
Development District (EDD) designation to unlock additional federal dollars and 
support for economic development and resilience projects across the state. 

DBEDT Testimony

Failure to fund these positions will result in the loss of staffing required to 
maintain the EDD designation and benefits. 
 
• BED144/PL - 1.00 Permanent FTE (FY 26: $35,508 / FY 27: $71,016) for the 
Statewide Sustainability Branch to support statewide climate and sustainability 
coordination/implementation. Established by HRS §225M-8 (Act 45, SLH 2020), 
the Branch coordinates and implements policies, evaluates legislation, and 
advises the Governor, Legislature, and agencies on sustainability and climate 
resilience. Currently, the Branch has only 1.00 FTE (State Sustainability 
Coordinator). This request would expand capacity to meet climate resilience 
demands.  
 
• BED144/PL - $45,570 each year to restore full-year funding for 1.00 FTE 
permanent Planning Program Manager #11310. The personnel costs for this 
permanent civil service position were reduced by five months of salary when the 
incumbent was appointed by Governor Green to serve as the Director of the 
Office of Planning and Sustainable Development for a term-limited appointment 
with return rights to the position.  The salary needs to be restored to 12 months’ 
salary in order for the incumbent to exercise return rights. 
 
• BED144/PZ – Convert 5.00 Permanent FTE from federal funds to general funds.  
This would include an increase of General Funds of $411,408, and a decrease of 
Federal funds of $663,629 each year for the Coastal Zone Management Program 
(CZM).  From 1975 to approx. 2009, the positions were general funded. In 2009, 
the positions were converted to federal funding following a decline in State 
revenues. The provision of federal funds from NOAA was temporary, with a 
condition that the State take active steps to restore State funding for the 
positions. The restoration of general funds for the positions ensures that the 
State can satisfy the condition(s) of the federal cooperative agreement to 
maintain eligibility for CZM to receive its annual award of $2.5 million. 
 
Hawai‘i Community Development Authority (BED150/KA) 
• 1.00 Program Specialist V and funds of $100,000 each year.  Act 97, SLH 2023 
established the ninety-nine leasehold program, which included two temporary 
positions through June 2025. The multi-year endeavor required HCDA to 
promulgate rules for the sale of the leasehold interest of residential condominium 
units and develop one project on non-ceded lands within an urban 
redevelopment site.  The project is well underway, and the position is needed to 
administer the program.   
 
• $500,000 in FY26 for a Climate Change Impact Assessment.  Act 221, SLH 2023 
required the HCDA to consider the impacts of sea level rise in its Kakaʻako and 
Kalaeloa community development districts. There is a need to engage with

stakeholders and landowners to promulgate rules. The HCDA will commence 
rulemaking that considers the impacts of climate change, sea level rise, climate-
resilient development, and duty to preserve and protect customary and traditional 
rights of Native Hawaiians, in the design and siting of buildings in the Kakaʻako 
and Kalaeloa community development districts. 
 
Agribusiness Development Corporation (BED170/KB) 
• $120,000 revolving fund ceiling increase in FY26 for Attorney General support. 
With the acquisition of the Mililani Tech Park, there is extensive legal work 
required to create a clear path for the use of agricultural technology in the park.  
There will be work in unwinding some of the encumbrances and creating a legal 
path forward.  In addition, ADC needs research done to verify ADC properties 
that are ceded lands and appropriate fees to be paid for OHA & DHHL.  The ADC 
will need to define what percentage, if any, is paid for Common Area 
Maintenance, Conservation Easements, Mining/dirt or rock, & Grant money. 
Current attorney has a workload that includes two lawsuits with ongoing 
compliance, in addition to a review of the Kekaha Agriculture Association MOA 
for ADC compliance with the terms. Going forward there are best management 
and additional federal rules that will affect Hawai‘i agricultural business. There is 
no alternative for this request. 
 
Stadium Authority (BED180/SA) 
• $49,500,000 in FY26 to increase the Stadium Development Special Fund (SDSF) 
ceiling to allow Stadium Authority to allot and expend the funds appropriated in 
Act 248, Session Laws of Hawaii 2022 and by proviso 17.3 authorized to deposit 
the appropriation into the SDSF. The ceiling increase will provide SA with a great 
amount of flexibility to utilize these funds to support the New Aloha Stadium 
Entertainment District (NASED) project.

resiliency, develop ag related products and intellectual property for export, create 
higher paying STEM related jobs, and keep local talent in Hawaii. The FTZ has a 
$6.1M federal earmark for this project but needs working capital to move the 
project forward.  
 
Hawai‘i Tourism Authority (BED113) 
• For the fiscal biennium, HTA initially submitted a $20,000,000 CIP request to the 
Governor through DBEDT. However, following the lapsing of $13.7 million in CIP 
funds appropriated under Act 248, SLH 2022, and revised project estimates, HTA 
now requests $52,000,000 in CIP funds for FY 2026 to fully fund all R&M 
projects.  This increase will support planned Hawai‘i Convention Center (HCC) 
renovations scheduled for completion in calendar year 2026, during the center’s

Executive Office on Early Learning's Position:  SUPPORT 
 
The Executive Office on Early Learning (EOEL) offers the following comments in support of H.B. 
No. 300 and requests your consideration of the following budget requests. 
 
Expansion of EOEL Prekindergarten (Pre-K) classrooms 
The EOEL's highest priority request is for funds and positions to support the expansion of EOEL 
Prekindergarten (Pre-K) classrooms over the next biennium. We are requesting $5,027,927 and 
58 positions in FY26, and $8,236,302 and 108 positions in FY27. This funding will allow the EOEL 
to add an additional 50 classrooms over the next two years. 
 
In 2020, the Hawaiʻi State Legislature passed Act 46 which established a framework and 
benchmarks for achieving universal access to early learning for 3- and 4-year-olds. The 
requested expansion of EOEL Pre-K classrooms helps advance our progress toward these goals 
and supports educational equity through priority enrollment for at-risk children. 
  
Since the passage of Act 46, the number of EOEL prekindergarten classrooms has grown. The 
EOEL currently partners with the Hawaiʻi State Department of EducaƟon (HIDOE) to administer 
92 Public Pre-K classrooms in 74 HIDOE campuses across the State. However, demand remains 
high, with the number of applications far exceeding the number of available classroom seats for 
the 2024-25 school year.

As the program continues to grow, EOEL also works closely with HIDOE to ensure children 
enrolled in our classrooms receive high-quality early childhood development and early learning 
experiences that promote Kindergarten readiness. We are happy to report that the program is 
consistently recognized by the National Institute for Early Education Research (NIEER) for 
meeting benchmarks for quality standards, and as of their 2023 report, Hawaiʻi is one of only 
five states that met all 10 benchmarks for state preschool programs. 
 
Family Child Interaction Learning Programs 
The EOEL also respectfully requests your consideration of funding to support Family Child 
Interaction Learning Programs (FCILs), which was approved by the Early Learning Board but not 
included in the Governor's budget request. We are requesting $800,000 in FY26 and FY27 for 
contracts with third-party providers of FCIL programs. 
 
FCILs are an important component of a strong, mixed-delivery early learning system, offering 
families flexibility in choosing the type of early childhood development and learning 
experiences that best meet their needs.  
 
They promote children’s well-being by supporting families in their growth as their children’s 
first and most important teachers. The programs provide activities and opportunities for 
families who may not be interested in or able to participate in more traditional child care or 
preschool programs.  
 
These programs are characterized by a multi-generational, culturally responsive approach that 
values and incorporates the diverse backgrounds of participating families. With a dual focus on 
parent education and early learning, they provide opportunities for children and caregivers to 
grow together. The setting often resembles a child care classroom, but with the key distinction 
that families are responsible for their own children while attending the program. Activities 
often include group circle time, outdoor play, and a variety of learning stations designed to 
foster engagement and development. In addition to these interactive experiences, family 
members receive instruction on child development, workforce readiness, financial literacy, and 
other essential life skills, equipping them with the tools to support both their children’s and 
their own success. 
 
EOEL strongly supports these budget requests which will expand access to high-quality early 
learning, advance educational equity, and help fulfill the state's commitment to universal 
access to early learning for 3 and 4-year-olds. We appreciate the Legislature's continued 
investment in our youngest keiki and their families and respectfully request your support of this 
funding.

DEPARTMENT’S POSITION:  The Department of Human Services (DHS) supports this measure. 
 
PURPOSE:  This bill appropriates funds for the operating and capital improvement budget of 
the Executive Branch for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027. 
 
On behalf of the staff of the Department of Human Services (DHS), we appreciate the 
opportunity to present the department's biennium budget requests.  We thank the Legislature 
for its continuing support of the department's staff and operational needs.  DHS continues to 
provide vital benefits and services to Hawaii residents as we modernize our information 
systems and business processes. 
 
We acknowledge that many Hawaii residents are struggling to make ends meet and continue to 
apply for and require government assistance at near-record levels.  We recognize the immense 
value of the hardworking human services workforce and community providers who strive to 
provide services with Aloha in timely and responsive ways.  We know residents' and workers' 
success and well-being depend on safe and stable living and working environments, and having 
resources.

DHS 'Ohana Nui multigenerational approach supports the well-being of the whole person, 
individual, family, and community.  It is our highest priority to support the child welfare 
workforce as we work with the Office of Wellness & Resilience and the Malama Ohana Work 
Group and stakeholders to improve the child protective system and respond to community 
concerns.  These budget requests reflect the need for continued investment in the human 
services workforce and the work environment to improve the technology available to the public 
and staff and to ensure workplace safety.  The budget includes investment in Hawaii's health 
care programs, providers, and institutions that serve residents with Medicaid health coverage.   
 
Highlights of our priorities in this fiscal biennium (FB) budget for 2025-2027 include requests 
for: 
• Shortage differential for the recruitment and retention of child protective services 
workers; 
• Funds for the Comprehensive Child Welfare Information System (CCWIS); 
• Funds to support victims of sex trafficking; 
• Funds to continue the Family Resource Centers pilot program aimed to increase services 
for families in communities, schools, and a correctional facility as a prevention strategy 
to reduce child abuse and neglect and improve children's and parents' engagement in 
school; 
• Increased funding for In-home Home and Community-Based services that keep kupuna 
and people with disabilities in the community and avoid having to move them to 
significantly more expensive nursing facilities;  
• Sustained funding for increased reimbursement rates for most medical professional 
services to 100% of Medicare as funding is non-recurring;   
• Sustained funding  for Applied Behavioral Analysis services, Child Wellness Pilot 
program, as funding is non-recurring; 
• Funds for increased payments for death benefits as funding was only appropriated in 
Act 108, SLH 2024 for FY 2025; 
• The Hospital Sustainability and Nursing Facilities Sustainability Special Funds that 
support increased payments to hospitals and nursing facilities that serve residents on 
Medicaid; 
• Increased funds to address and reduce homelessness with continued development, 
maintenance, and operations of Kauhale; 
• Sustained funding for homeless services: Family Assessment Centers, Housing First, 
Homeless Outreach including legal services, and Rapid Rehousing – these items are 
currently non-recurring;  
• An additional year of funding to continue temporary housing and other recovery efforts 
for Maui Wildfire survivors;  
• Funds to continue the Summer Electronic Benefits Transfer Program (S-EBT) for 
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits for public school children 
during the summer break; 

Department of Human Services

• Funds to support youth mental health services provided through the Office of Youth 
Services; 
• A CIP request to continue modernizing the Benefits Eligibility System to improve the 
application for and delivery of financial Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Benefits 
(SNAP) and benefits; and 
• A ceiling increase of the Randolph Sheppard Revolving Account that supports the blind 
vendors program. 
The Hawaii Public Housing Authority also has significant requests to support public and low-
income housing and will submit its budget narrative. 
 
Notably, the general fund additions that serve as state matching funds required for federally 
funded programs will allow DHS to access approximately $58.89M in additional federal 
matching funds or federal reimbursement for FY2026 and an additional $54.66M in FY2027 in 
federal funds.1 
 
The Department continues to process a high number of monthly applications, and Medicaid 
and child care caseloads remain above pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels as individuals and 
families continue to need assistance to meet Hawaii's high cost of living.  DHS leadership is 
mindful of the impacts of a slowing economy or higher consumer costs that have a direct 
relationship with more residents seeking public assistance.  Housing instability and evictions are 
major long-lasting disruptions to the well-being of children, families, and individuals, and 
increased funding to address housing instability and increasing housing inventory is necessary. 
 
From a workforce perspective, DHS continues to have high vacancy rates influenced by another 
year of long-term employees retiring in 2024, as well as a general shortage of human services 
workers due to wage gaps and the toll of providing services to residents with complex needs.    
We must continue to have the resources and flexibility to innovate, train, and support career 
pathways and the professional development of the current and future human services 
workforce.   
 
 
 
1 DHS strategizes to maximize available federal funds.  The various federally funded or split-funded benefit 
programs often provide federal matching funds for operations, including personnel costs, or use a reimbursement 
model where the State upfronts 100% of the expenditures and then seeks federal reimbursement for a percentage 
of the expenditures.  Notably, these budget requests do not consider potential policy and fiscal changes that may 
be forthcoming by the federal.

Figure 2. Major DHS programs by division, ver.2023 
 
With 2,400 positions in more than 80 offices statewide, DHS continues to serve nearly 1/3 of 
Hawaii's population with one or more benefits or services.  In SFY25, DHS manages an annual 
budget of over $4.46 billion, of which more than 65% are federal funds.  Notably, DHS 
distributes a vast majority of federal funds as benefits or services and can also access federal 
matching funds or seek federal reimbursement to pay for salaries and operations.  To continue 
to serve Hawaii's residents efficiently and effectively, we have the following strategic goals: 
Goal 1: Improve the self-sufficiency and well-being of Hawai‘i’s individuals and families.   
DHS provides benefits and services to vulnerable individuals and families by assisting 
them with financial assistance and nutrition assistance, securing gainful employment 
toward economic self-sufficiency, supporting early childhood development and school 
readiness, providing access to health care, intervention, and prevention services that 
address abuse and neglect, and increasing housing stability. 
 
Goal 2: Improve service integration and delivery to develop solutions for sustainable 
outcomes.

DHS programs and benefits support Hawaii's individuals, families, and communities, 
contribute to our local economy, and establish Hawai‘i DHS as a national human 
service delivery leader.  We are transforming our policies, processes, and systems to 
improve the self-sufficiency and well-being of Hawai‘i’s individuals and families.  We 
aim to serve residents across programs and divisions with integrated eligibility and 
case management applications and a vision for the future that connects residents 
quickly to available resources. 
 
(1)  
Modernizing the DHS IT infrastructure,  
(2)  
Implementing our multigenerational ‘Ohana Nui framework to end 
intergenerational poverty, and  
(3)  
Developing and implementing the department's strategic plan and 
performance measures.  See the attached DHS Key Performance 
Indicators (KPI). 
 
With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, DHS maintains a hybrid work environment 
while maintaining and increasing safe access to benefits and services.  Experienced 
and innovative leadership and dedicated staff executed the many pandemic programs 
and programmatic changes built on skills gained through our ongoing business 
processes and IT modernization efforts.  IT investments during the pandemic 
continued to build on organizational changes DHS began when implementing the 
Affordable Care Act.  With improved technology, staff are more able to provide 
services statewide and are not geographically limited to process work on their home 
island.  Supervisors and administrators are better able to redirect human resources 
when necessary.   However, we need to continue to recruit, hire, train, and support 
the human services workforce as the magnitude of demand for services has increased. 
 
DHS continues to support recovery efforts resulting from the 2023 Maui Wildfires.  
The Rental Assistance Program, the housing development at Ka La‘i Ola, and the Pu‘u 
honua o Nene continue to support Maui residents with interim housing needs, 
especially for those who do not qualify for federal assistance from the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).  The Maui Relief Temporary Assistance for 
Needy Families (TANF) Program continues to provide financial assistance to families 
with children who do not qualify for FEMA benefits.  DHS is also the lead agency for 
the State's FEMA Disaster Case Management Program which provides case 
management services for all Maui residents impacted by the fires. 
 
Goal 3: Improve staff health and development.   
Like many human services agencies across the country, DHS continues to face high 
vacancy rates as higher-paying private and public sector jobs attract the available 
workforce.  Findings from a recent wage equity study from the University of 
Washington School of Social Work found that: 

Department of Human Services 
March 4, 2025 
Page 8 of 94 
 
AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY AGENCY 
 
 
(1) "human services workers are systematically paid less than workers in non-
care industries, with estimated pay gaps of 30% or more across different 
econometric models[,]" and  
(2) "human services workers are paid less than workers in other industries or 
sectors whose tasks are rated as comparable through a systematic job 
evaluation process."3 
 
As such, we need to address compensation and engage in broad cross-sector 
opportunities to encourage and support the State's health and human services 
workforce with career pathways and professional development that promote skills-
building and leadership development. 
 
 
B. Overview - Discuss how current state-wide conditions have affected agency operations and 
the ability to meet goals.  Identify and discuss notable performance measures, expected 
outcomes, and recent results. 
 
The significant conditions impacting DHS operations and ability to meet all program goals are: 
• High vacancy rates across the department; 
• Continued high application rates and caseloads above pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels; 
• A return to pre-COVID-19 pandemic program rules while implementing other new 
program rules or processes;  
• Resources need to conduct 2023 Maui Wildfire response and recovery lines of effort, 
• The consequences of Hawaii's high cost of living and doing business, and  
• Uncertainties of new federal policies and impact on programming and funding with the 
current administration. 
With low unemployment and better-paying opportunities in the private sector, DHS will 
continue to face difficulty filling positions that will impact the department's ability to deliver 
timely benefits and services.  We continue to see high application and enrollment rates for 
SNAP and Medicaid programs as Hawaii residents continue to struggle to meet high housing 
and consumer prices, even as Hawaii's unemployment rate remains low.  If the national and 
state economies slow or face disruptions that increase consumer prices, we anticipate 
additional increases in applications and program enrollment as residents seek assistance. 
 
The SNAP program is hampered by the inability to fill eligibility worker positions necessary to 
authorize SNAP applications and benefits.  The November 2024 SNAP caseload serving 83,364 
households is above the caseload of pre-COVID January 2020 (=79,672 households).  COVID-19

pandemic program waivers that allowed a high of 111,900 households in July 2021 ended in 
2024.   
 
During the height of the pandemic, as previously reported, DHS experienced a high error rate, 
resulting in the U.S. Food & Nutrition Service issuing a fiscal penalty to the State.  DHS has an 
administration measure for an emergency appropriation that will provide funds to improve the 
IT system to reduce errors as part of the penalty.    
 
Additionally, the return to regular program rules includes reinstatement of additional steps that 
have caused applicants and recipients to experience long wait times to have eligibility 
determined or maintained.  Congress also made additional adjustments to the SNAP program 
that DHS is addressing, along with amending program rules and modifying its system to address 
the changes that will increase program eligibility. 
 
However, in the summer of 2024, the SNAP program successfully implemented the first 
Summer Electronic Benefits Transfer (Summer-EBT) program to 90,000 public school students 
with $177 each during the summer break.  DHS is working on the 2nd year of the S-EBT program, 
which will require additional program requirements. 
The Medicaid program is also experiencing high application rates and enrollment levels.  In 
2024, the Med-QUEST Division (MQD) successfully redetermined eligibility for all Medicaid 
enrollees as a part of the "unwinding" from COVID-19 pandemic programming.  In December 
2024, the "new normal" for Medicaid program enrollment is hovering at 406,337; this is a 
decrease from the peak pandemic enrollment of 468,120 in 2023.  However, the current 
enrollment level is nearly 80,000 more residents than the number enrolled in March 2020.  Of 
note, the "unwinding" included a reduction of the percentage of the base federal match for 
Medicaid, which may require a higher general fund appropriation to support the enrollment at 
the 400k "new normal."  
We anticipate continued housing instability and low inventory amongst Hawaii's low-income 
residents.  The State Office on Homelessness and Housing Solutions requests funding to 
increase the number of Kauhale ("tiny homes") projects statewide and to maintain the current 
Kauhale inventory.  Restoration of homeless services funding that supports Housing First (the 
State's permanent supportive housing program), homeless outreach including legal services, 
family assessment centers, and rapid rehousing services. 
Child care is also experiencing high participation rates as DHS distributed COVID-19 pandemic 
funds and implemented the state-funded expanded Preschool Open Doors (POD) program for 
Hawaii's 3- and 4-year-old children.  Parents benefit from child care subsidies to access 
affordable quality child care.  Parents and caretakers can go to work or school with confidence 
that their children are being well cared for.

DHS dispersed $114,000,000 from the federal American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 
No. 117-2) (ARPA).  These ARPA funds sustained and buffered child care providers through the 
most tumultuous parts of the pandemic and recovery period.  Between December 2021 and 
September 2023, DHS distributed $72,000,000 of ARPA child care stabilization funds directly to 
616 licensed and registered family child care homes, group child care centers, group child care 
homes, infant and toddler centers, before and after school facilities, and exempt center-based 
providers of afterschool A+ services.  In November 2024, DHS concluded its supplemental grant 
program, providing an additional $42,000,000 directly to 617 child care providers between May 
and November 2024. 
The supplemental grants were intended to prevent permanent closures and support child care 
businesses by offsetting providers’ operating expenses, improving quality, and increasing 
workforce compensation so that child care providers could recruit and retain a skilled 
workforce.  Providers received two (2) rounds each of operating expense and staff retention 
awards which directors, teachers, assistant teachers, lead caregivers, and caregivers received a 
disbursement of $4,500, and all other caregiving staff received a disbursement of $3,000.  DHS 
is currently working on data collection and analysis of the supplemental grant program.   
The end of ARPA funding is a significant concern for the child care sector, and the Legislature 
may need to consider additional funds to support child care providers.   
DHS Child Care Programs Office successfully implemented the POD program's First Come First 
Served open application period, which runs from July 1, 2024 – January 31, 2025.  The change in 
application processing per Act 153, Session Laws of Hawaii (SLH) 2024, allows DHS to process 
applications on a first-come, first-served basis after the priority period closes to allow a 
continuous enrollment process throughout the program year.  The change facilitates more 
access to subsidies and a school readiness program without delay.  Nearly 2,000 applications 
have been received, with July 2024 bringing in the highest total of 938 applications.  As of 
November 2024, 1,963 3- and 4-year-old children are enrolled in POD.  By the end of 
November, POD will achieve an enrollment count of more than 2,000 children.  This is a 
significant increase from the previous school year by more than 600 children.  The department 
is also considering rule amendments to further support the expansion of POD through 
increased eligibility limits and lowered co-payments for families. 
DHS leadership continues to lead the department's emergency management efforts.  The 
Director's Office continues to lead the Rent Assistance Program, the development of interim 
housing at Ka Lai Ola, and the FEMA Disaster Case Management grant program.  The SOHHS 
also maintains the Pu‘u Honua o Nene field shelter for individuals who were experiencing 
homelessness prior to the August 2023 wildfires.  The TANF program also maintains the Maui 
TANF Recovery Program providing cash assistance to families with children.  The Director's 
office also established a temporary auditor position to ensure that all Maui-related expenses

are adequately documented and the recent hiring of the administrative assistant position in the 
Director's office should assist with updating the department's emergency management and 
continuity plans.  
 
Summaries by Division and the Office of Youth Services 
 
Benefit, Employment & Support Services (BESSD) 
 
Table 1. BESSD Position Counts. 
 
 
BESSD continues to experience high vacancies in its Statewide Branch Processing Centers due to 
retirements, a lack of interested applicants, and opportunities for higher-wage jobs, making 
positions difficult to fill.   The challenge of filling Eligibility Worker (EW) and Office Assistant 
(OA) positions is a national issue.  We continue to process the work despite having only three-
fourths (76%) of the optimal workforce of Eligibility Workers and less than half (49%) of the 
clerical support needed to manage the ongoing demand.  BESSD continues to recruit for both 
EW and OA positions actively, utilizes Wiki Wiki Hire, and conducts weekly interviews on Oahu.  
However, despite recruitment efforts, vacancies for OA positions have increased.  In an entry-
level position, as OAs gain more experience, they often move to positions within the state that 
have more responsibilities and higher pay.  
 
The continued high rate of vacancies highlights the critical need to fill and retain Eligibility 
Workers and clerical positions as the number of phone calls and applications for SNAP continue 
to increase.  Over the past year, the number of calls for interviews required for SNAP and other 
benefits has increased due to a combination of changes in federal policy and the ending of 
pandemic-era waivers.  In calendar year 2023,  the number of interview calls was 8,050 per 
month.  The number of interview calls increased to over 17,000 by September 2024 and to 
40,233 calls in November 2024.

The SNAP caseload as of November 2024 (=158,425 individuals) is higher than the pre-
pandemic levels of February 2020 (=153,047 individuals).  However, the number of monthly 
applications in November 2024 (=7,129) is higher than the number of monthly applications 
received pre-pandemic in February 2020 (=4,412).  In October 2024, the number of applications 
(=9,083 applications) was more than double the average number of 4,500 applications received 
prior to the pandemic. 
 
 
Figure 3. Graph of SNAP Households July 2019 – November 2024 
 
Despite the high rate of applications, caseloads have remained relatively stable, though 
trending upward, due to a high rate of application denials for various reasons, such as being 
over-income or failing to submit all required documents for verification.  In November 2024, 
over half (=58%, or 4731/8186 applications) were denied.   
 
In addition, in 2024, the federal law changed, authorizing SNAP eligibility for Compact of Free 
Association (COFA) citizens living in the United States.  The Consolidated Appropriation Act 
(CAA) of 2024 changed the federal law for Compact residents authorizing eligibility for SNAP, 
TANF, Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and FEMA assistance.  The CAA had a

positive impact on residents from Compact nations and on states allowing federal assistance for 
its residents from COFA nations. 
 
In early 2025, DHS anticipates that the number of applications for SNAP will further increase 
due to a planned rule change to implement Broad Based Categorical Eligibility (BBCE) provisions 
and remove the net income limit for eligible households.  DHS has drafted amendments to the 
Hawaii Administrative Rules (HAR) to implement this change, and a public hearing was held on 
December 12, 2024.  A report by the University of Hawaii Economic Research Organization 
(UHERO) estimated that this policy change would add 14,000-15,000 additional households to 
the SNAP caseload. 
 
The unwinding of pandemic-era waivers has contributed to the increase in the workload for 
BESSD Processing Centers.  Prior to October 2024, the United States Department of Agriculture 
Food & Nutrition Services (FNS) authorized a waiver enabling DHS to conduct a desk review for 
eligibility renewals for SNAP and other benefits instead of requiring an interview.  During the 
COVID-19 pandemic, this waiver allowed DHS to process the highest volume of applications as 
residents struggled during the economic shutdown.  However, with the waiver's end, the 
interviews for eligibility renewals restarted in October 2024.  In November 2024, over 10,000 
clients required eligibility renewals, which contributed to the increased number of individuals 
calling for interviews.   
 
BESSD is working to prioritize staffing on its call center to better respond to the increased 
number of calls.  The Processing Centers also continue to work overtime four Saturdays per 
month to address the application and renewal backlog.   
 
A continued priority for the Division is the ongoing development of a new Benefits Eligibility 
Solution (BES) eligibility system to replace the 40-year-old Hawaii Automated Welfare 
Information (HAWI) legacy system.  The BES is scheduled to be implemented in mid-2026 and it 
will include an automated rules engine and online Self-Service Portal that will streamline and 
increase efficiency for processing of SNAP and other related benefits. 
 
In addition, BESSD continues to work on its oversight of other programs, such as Child Care 
Subsidy, Child Care Licensing, Employment & Training, the Homeless Programs Office (HPO), 
and the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP).  In 2024, BESSD launched a 
new online system for providers and residents and the Preschool Open Doors program to 
increase access to child care for eligible households with 3- and 4-year-old children. 
 
As we enter the 2025 legislative session, BESSD requests the Legislature's continued support to 
meet our resource needs so we can improve our delivery of needed benefits and services to 
Hawaii's residents and improve our working environment and conditions. 
 
Division of Vocational Rehabilitation Services (DVR) 

Department of Human Services

AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY AGENCY 
 
DVR administers statewide vocational rehabilitation services programs for persons with 
physical, cognitive, and mental health disabilities.  These programs include independent living 
rehabilitation services for persons with disabilities, general services for persons who are blind 
and visually impaired, and the disability determination of claims for Social Security Disability 
Insurance and Supplemental Security Income benefits issued by the Social Security 
Administration.   
DVR provides vocational rehabilitation programs as required by the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 
as amended, the Randolph-Sheppard Vending Stands Act, the Workforce Innovation and 
Opportunity Act, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, the Americans with Disabilities 
Act, and other applicable federal and state laws, regulations, policies, and agreements with 
other state agencies and the federal government. 
DVR MISSION – DVR serves participants who require assistance to prepare for, secure, retain, 
or advance in competitive, integrated employment.  DVR staff works as a team so that 
participants can achieve their hopes and aspirations for meaningful employment through timely 
and individualized vocational rehabilitation services. 
DVR estimates that federal vocational rehabilitation funding will be $16,380,877 in FFY 2025 
(October 1, 2024-September 30, 2025) with a required State match of $4,433,452 starting in 
FFY25.  
In 2024, DVR commenced work on the Neighbor Island Blind and Visually Impaired pilot 
program authorized by Act 253, Session Laws of Hawaii 2023.  The 2023 Maui Wildfire response 
delayed DVR's work on the pilot.  However, DVR procured a contractor, met with stakeholders, 
and developed a plan.  DHS is proposing an administrative measure (SB 1419 SD1 RELATING TO 
ACT 253, SESSION LAWS OF HAWAII 2023) to revise the pilot.  Additional appropriations will be 
required and are pending a Governor's Message.  The pilot program will assist neighbor island 
residents who are blind or have low vision to gain skills that will improve their communication 
and independence.  The pilot will serve individuals who may not be interested in employment 
and who do not qualify for services available through the Department of Education or to 
individuals 55 years or older. 
DVR is seeing an increase in applications for services from Hawaii residents with disabilities who 
are eager to prepare for, obtain, retain, or advance in competitive integrated employment in 
the workforce.  Additionally, DVR continues to work with employers in all sectors to encourage 
them to hire qualified individuals with disabilities. 
The Randolph-Sheppard Revolving Account ceiling increase request of $669,800 for HMS 802 
will ensure that DVR has access to the special funds supporting necessary services to our blind 
vending program. This ceiling increase does not affect or increase DVR’s current State funding.

In Program Year 2023 (July 1, 2023 – June 30, 2024), the Division of Vocational Rehabilitation 
(DVR) was tasked with achieving five performance indicators set by our federal funder, the 
Rehabilitation Services Administration of the U.S. Department of Education. These measures 
include:  
1. Credential Attainment Rate – The percentage of participants enrolled in an education or 
training program (excluding those in On-the-Job Training and customized training) who obtain a 
recognized postsecondary credential or a secondary school diploma or its equivalent during 
participation or within one year after exiting DVR’s program services;  
2. Employment Rate for the 2nd Quarter After Exit – The percentage of participants who are 
still employed six months after exiting DVR;  
3. Employment Rate for the 4th Quarter After Exit – The percentage of participants who are still 
employed twelve months after exiting DVR;  
4. Median Earnings – The median earnings of consumers who are employed six months after 
exiting DVR; and   
5. Measurable Skills Gains (MSG) Rate – The percentage of consumers enrolled in training 
programs who achieve documented skills gains. *Note: Although MSG was initially set as a 
negotiated performance level, national data has proven unreliable for measuring performance 
and, therefore, was not utilized in Program Year 2023. 
DVR achieved two out of four performance indicators (Credential Attainment Rate and Median 
Earnings) for Program Year 2023 (July 1, 2023 - June 30, 2024). While DVR did not meet two of 
the four indicators, no sanctions were imposed since the actual employment rates for the 2nd 
and 4th quarters after exit were above the Indicator Score of 50%, with scores of 80.8% and 
75.8%, respectively.

The achievement of two out of four performance indicators is significant, especially considering 
DVR’s high vacancy rate, which is currently around 40% due to retirements and resignations. 
Initiatives are in progress to retain our excellent staff and fill vacancies. These initiatives include 
revision of minimum qualifications, streamlining processes, reviewing pay rates, planning for 
additional needed positions, and enhancing clear, positive communication. 
 
Med-QUEST Division (MQD) 
 
  
The Med-QUEST Division (MQD) administers Medicaid that provides health coverage, and state-
funded medical assistance programs, primarily through managed care plans, to eligible Hawai‘i 
residents.  Medicaid started in 1965 under Title XIX of the Social Security Act and is 
administered as a joint federal-state program that provides health coverage and long-term care 
for children, pregnant women, parents of eligible children, low-income adults, former foster 
care children, aged, blind, and disabled individuals.  MQD’s mission is to empower Hawai'i’s 
residents to improve and sustain well-being by developing, promoting, and administering innovative 
and high-quality healthcare programs with aloha. 
As of December 16, 2024, the Med-QUEST Division (MQD) provides Medicaid coverage for over 
406,000 residents, representing about 28 percent of Hawaii's population.  While this percent is 
higher than before the start of the pandemic, it is a decrease from the 468,120 enrollees at the 
peak of the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency in April of 2023.  The "new normal" is nearly 
80,000 higher than the 327,000 caseloads that preceded the COVID-19 pandemic.   
In 2024, MQD completed one of its largest undertakings to date to redetermine the eligibility of 
all Medicaid enrollees as required by the end of the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency, which 
is known as the "unwinding."

Social Services Division - Child Welfare Services and Adult Protective & Community Services 
 
The Social Services Division (SSD) provides services to eligible families and individuals.  The Child 
Welfare Services Branch (CWS) provides prevention and intervention services to reduce the 
incidence and impact of child abuse and neglect.  The Adult Protective & Community Services 
Branch (APCS) responds to reports of adult neglect or abuse and oversees the Adult Foster Care 
Program, Senior Companion Program, Foster Grandparent Program, Nurse Aid Training, and Re-
Certification curriculum.  
 
The Division's priorities are to work with the Office of Wellness & Resilience and the Malama 
Ohana Working Group to address community concerns, implement pay differentials for child 
welfare services workers as a retention strategy, and add additional security in child welfare 
offices.  Notably, SSD continues to modernize its case management systems so case workers 
and administrators can access case information to better serve children and families.  Social 
workers need better tools that improve processes and give workers more time to spend with 
children and families, and connect with providers and resource caregivers. 
 
CWS is moving forward with its Comprehensive Child Welfare Information System (CCWIS), 
named HI-THRIVE.  CCWIS financing is eligible for 50% federal reimbursement.  Currently, DHS 
estimates the overall planning and implementation cost of CCWIS in the range of $35 million to 
$40 million, with a 50/50 federal reimbursement.  However, costs to other states that have 
already developed their CCWIS project range from $60 million to $80 million. 
 
Once in place, CCWIS will improve the workers' and supervisors' case management, enable 
easier extraction for reporting requirements, and give CWS more opportunities to draw down 
available Title IV-E funds.   
 
APCS is moving forward with modernizing its data system, Living Aloha for Vulnerable Adults 
(LAVA), with the assistance of Federal grant money and requests general funds to build upon 
the completed work. 
 
Once implemented, CCWIS and LAVA will make data entry easier, support higher quality data, 
allow for more accurate and timely reporting, offer decision-making guidance, and provide 
more access and data sharing with clients and our external partners. 
 
 
Office of Youth Services  
With a solid commitment to meeting the needs of children and families, the Office of Youth 
Services (OYS) is responsible for the planning, case management, and delivery of services to 
youth at risk (section 352D-1, HRS).  In addition, OYS oversees the Hawaii Youth Correctional 
Facilities (HYCF), the Kawailoa Youth and Family Wellness Center (section 352D-7.5, HRS), and 
the support staff for the Hawaii State Youth Commission (section 352D-11, HRS).

Community-wide juvenile justice reform, including an investment in OYS contracted programs, 
has had a positive impact on reducing juvenile arrests and successfully diverting youth from the 
justice system.  Figure 1 shows the number of individual juveniles arrested for both status and 
law offenses.  Arrests in both categories for FY23 are lower than in pre-pandemic fiscal years 
2017 through 2019. 
 
 
Figure 6.  Individual Juvenile Arrests, Statewide FY2017- FY2023 
These positive results are due to upfront system prevention programs and services for at-risk 
youth, including positive youth development, cultural programs, outreach and advocacy, 
housing, and diversion programs.  Reductions of these programs or failure to address the 
increased needs of children will counteract these positive trends, decrease public safety, and 
increase youth entering into and moving deeper through the juvenile justice system.

Figure 7. Total HYCF Adminissions FY2008 – FY2024 
Figure 7 above shows juvenile admissions to HYCF from fiscal years 2008 through 2023.  From 
2009, when Hawaii invested in the national Juvenile Detention Alternatives (JDAI) program, to 
2023, admissions to HYCF were reduced by 83%.  Alarmingly, admissions to HYCF in FY23 
increased by 64% from the preceding year, with a slight decrease in FY24.  With concerns that 
youth behavioral and mental health issues are rising, it is expected that more youth will enter 
the juvenile justice system and HYCF. 
Any increase in the population at HYCF demonstrates a system that is not meeting the 
community’s need for increased support post-pandemic.  With the additional displacement and 
trauma experienced by victims of the 2023 Maui wildfires, community needs will continue to 
increase in the upcoming years.  Investment in front-end programs and services is needed to 
maintain progress and to reduce justice system involvement for at-risk youth.  OYS includes a 
request for funds for youth mental health programs. 
 
 
Hawaii State Commission on the Status of Women 
 
In 1964, Governor John A. Burns created the Hawaiʻi State Commission on the Status of Women

The DHS Fiscal Biennium (FB) 25-27 budget includes federal fund adjustments of $58,897,960 N 
and 19,550,000 P funds, for projected totals of $2,962,272,804 N and $38,310,191 P funds for 
FY 26, and $54,622,441 N and $19,550,000 P funds, for projected totals of $2,957,997,285 N 
and $38,310,191 for FY 27.  Note that these amounts are projected amounts that DHS may 
access.  However, to access federal funds, programs may require general fund contributions, or 
the federal funds are available for reimbursement to the State.  A majority of the federal funds 
are for health care premiums or pass directly to recipients as benefits.

• Budget Request Process  
 
The administration, divisions, attached agencies, and commissions submit budget requests with 
justification and prioritization in line with budget instructions issued by the Department of 
Budget & Finance (B&F).  The Director and the Budget, Planning, and Management Office 
(BPMO) review the budget requests.  After discussion with BPMO and each division 
administrator, the Director prioritizes the department's budget requests by applying the budget 
guidelines identified above and a second layer of prioritization by benefits to clients, support to 
staff, and infrastructure improvements.  The proposed budget requests are then submitted to 
B&F for review and preliminary decisions.  Programs have a chance to submit additional 
information to appeal B&F's initial denial.  After consideration of any appeals, B&F makes the 
final recommendations that become the Governor’s biennium budget.

HMS 904 – General Administration for DHS 
 
 
 
IT Modernization for the BES System 
 
This additional $10M request for FY26 is for additional work needed for the Design, 
Development, and Implementation (DDI) associated with BES in the upcoming year.   The 
additional $10M is needed to make refinements to system functionality, including refinements 
to correspondence, the automated rules engine, and the development of the BES Self-Service 
Portal (SSP) and to support testing for this functionality as it is developed.  
 
The current functionality of the BES development incorporates a manual workaround because 
the functions were not fully developed due to the limited funding and compressed timeline that 
the system build was working within prior to receiving the US Food & Nutrition Services (FNS) 
penalty letter (see below discussion).  Considering that FNS is allowing DHS to reinvest 50% of 
the penalty towards implementing more fully developed functionality, DHS knows that 50% of 
the penalty is not enough to ensure all root cause areas impacting the payment error rate that 
can be automated will be automated to reduce the chances of user error being introduced into 
the workflow.   
 
This budget request is to supplement the reinvestment of the 50% penalty amount that will 
support BES system development and testing of functionality.  Specific functionality in BES that 
will improve worker accuracy and reduce payment errors include the elimination of manual 
forms for interview documentation, the development of an interview workflow builder to guide 
an Eligibility Worker through the interview process, and an automated rules engine that will 
apply Hawaii Administrative Rules and federal policies based on inputs to the system. 
 
The anticipated completion of BES, including functionality to reduce payment errors, will be in 
the Fall of 2025.  Additional funds for the coming biennium will allow BESSD to complete the 
system development work, including testing of new functionality, roll out BES into production, 
and be available to both the public and the BESSD line staff.  The development will be done 
through a contract and BESSD's current system developer.  The entire $10M for FY26 is needed

in addition to the $5,467,164 requested through an Emergency Appropriation for FY25 (HB1099 
HD1/SB1418 SD1 MAKING AN EMERGENCY APPROPRIATION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN 
SERVICES) to ensure that BES is implemented with full functionality and that Hawaii has a 
functioning eligibility system that will reduce payment errors and help the State to avoid 
further financial.  A capable and modern eligibility system should improve residents' 
experiences. 
 
On June 28, 2024, FNS notified Hawaii that it had failed to achieve a SNAP payment error rate 
for federal fiscal year 2023 at or below the national average of 11.68%.  Hawaii's payment error 
rate was 20.94%.  This marked the second year in a row that Hawaii failed to perform below the 
national payment error rate.  As a result, FNS accessed a penalty of $10.9 million against 
Hawaii.  FNS offered Hawaii the option of paying the penalty in whole or agreeing to reinvest 
50% of the penalty into improvements that would result in an improvement of its payment 
error rate.  Hawaii elected to enter into an agreement with FNS to reinvest 50% of the penalty 
into system improvements to automate the eligibility and payment determination process.  The 
50% of the $10.9M FNS penalty will be requested through an emergency appropriation for FY25 
for $5,467,164.  The emergency appropriation is needed in this fiscal year to align needed 
modifications with ongoing BES development. 
 
 
HMS 503 – Kawailoa Youth and Family Wellness Center 
 
 
FY26.1 - KYFWC Master Plan, Oahu 
DAGS002 04-02-21 The original budget is to create and develop a process for the Master Plan to 
upgrade and renovate the Kawailoa Youth and Family Wellness Center (KYFWC).  This project 
will prioritize the CIP Implementation plan, provide budgetary estimates, and prepare an 
Environmental Impact Statement.  These improvements will add another 25 years of longevity 
to the campus and create a safe space for a transitional/residential/Mental Health program for 
Hawaii high-risk youth and their families. 
 
The KYFWC campus, on the Kailua grounds of the Hawaii Youth Correctional Facilities, is 96 
years old, built in 1928 as the Kawailoa Training School for Girls by the Territorial Government 
of Hawaii.  The Master Plan will allow for much-needed upgrades for campus infrastructure, 
demolish condemned buildings, and create additional needed program space for youth mental 
health programming.  The Master Plan is needed for KYFWC to adapt to the changing needs and 
services the youth require. 
 
Youths need a higher level of mental health treatment.  Currently, the State sends youths with 
multiple mental health diagnoses to the mainland for treatment when in-state services are not

available.  The community alternatives for mental health residential-type programming are 
limited, and there are no readily available alternatives to assist high-risk youth.  Hawaii needs to 
increase planning for the care of the high-risk population so these youths can get proper 
treatment, be near their support systems and community, and not have to be relocated to 
another state. 
 
KYFWC is also being designed to manage social service gaps in our state systems (Department 
of Health, Child Adolescent & Mental Health Division (CAMHD), Department of Education 
(DOE), DHS Child Welfare Services (CWS), the Judiciary, and OYS to focus on older youth and 
young adults from 14 - 24 years of age.  The programs at KYFWC will be primarily designed to 
assist in the transitioning of youths out of state services while providing critical support needed 
for youth and young adults to leave KYFWS's programs successfully. 
 
 
FY26.2 – KYFWC/HYCF Secured Custody Facility (SCF) Reroof Oahu 
This request is to assess and evaluate the structural integrity of the roof and design and 
construct new roofing.  The roof design and construction have to be within the scope of the 
state historical site standards and are part of the building's overall maintenance.  
 
The HYCF Secured Custody Facility was built in 1995 to house male wards of the state.  This 30-
bed correctional structure currently houses both male and female juveniles who were 
committed to the Office of Youth Services by Family Court.  SCF serves as the state's only 
juvenile correctional facility.   
 
Repairs to the roof are necessary to maintain the overall structural integrity after 30 years of 
use. The weather has taken its toll, and there is water leakage after heavy rains, which impacts 
electrical security systems, causing safety issues.  There are no alternatives to fixing the leaking 
roof. 
 
The project intends to increase the life of the correctional structure and reduce our operational 
and maintenance costs.

This request adds 1.00 permanent FTE and funds for OYS.  In 2007, the OYS was staffed with 30 
positions, including 12 Program Specialists and seven clerical staff.  In 2024, OYS is currently 
staffed with 19 positions, including 8 Program Specialists and three clerical staff.  Two of these 
Program Specialists and one clerical staff are specifically assigned to our statewide Office of 
Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) Title II federal grant program, and another 
Program Specialist specifically oversees the Youth Commission.  As a result, all other 
responsibilities of the program development office and OYS administration are performed by 
the remaining 14 staff members.   
 
Since 2007, OYS' responsibilities and workload have increased significantly to include 13 
additional contracts for a full continuum of care for at-risk youth and Grant-In-Aid (GIA) 
assignments, implementation of diversion programs (Act 201, SLH 2014), the Kawailoa Youth

Ideally, to adequately meet our statutory goals and responsibilities, OYS would need restoration 
of some of its positions, including 1.0 FTE for a permanent civil service Administrative Assistant 
II SR14 position for the Program Development Office that oversees all contracts and GIAs, 
diversion programs, program planning and development, and many other initiatives.  This 
position would assist with the current workload and be able to cross-train and cover duties 
when the only Administrative Assistant is on leave. 
 
501YA-02:  Youth Violence Prevention 
 
OYS currently budgets $385,500 annually for outreach and advocacy services, which serves 
approximately 90 youths who are at-risk, status offenders, or gang-involved.  Of these funds, 
$38,500 is dedicated to the Honolulu Police Department, District 8 (D8), which includes 
Nanakuli and Waianae, which serves approximately 20 youth annually.  This budget request is 
to triple violence prevention outreach and advocacy services in D8, Ewa, Makakilo, Nanakuli, 
Waianae, and Makaha. 
 
Recent data shows increases in reported violence in D8, where homicides were up 80% and 
weapons offenses were up 42% between 2022 and 2023.  The number of recent violent 
incidents involving youth on the Nanakuli-Waianae Coast is alarming.  A few of the high-profile 
cases are as follows:  In April 2024, three teens were accused of attacking and robbing a man; in 
February 2024, a 17-year-old was arrested in connection with the murder of a rancher; in 
January 2024, a youth was arrested in the shooting of a man killed by a stray bullet while in the 
man was sitting in his driveway; in November 2023, a 16-year-old male and a 21-year-old 
female were stabbed at a beach park; in September 2023, a teen was arrested for murder in an 
incident that left two people dead; and in June 2023, a 17-year-old female was shot in the head 
at Maili Community Park.  Many of the youth involved in these violent acts are not gang-
involved. 
 
Youth violence has significant and prolonged effects on young people’s mental and physical 
health as well as on the community.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC), youth violence impacts development, decision-making, the ability to learn 
and cope with stress, as well as connections to peers and adults.  It is linked to adverse health 
outcomes that disproportionately affect communities of color.  Exposure to violence increases 
the risk for behavioral and mental health difficulties, which include future violence perpetration 
and victimization, as well as depression, academic difficulties, and suicide.  Hawaii’s youth are 
in need of extra support, outreach, and advocacy to improve well-being and reduce violence. 
 
 
501YA-03:  Youth Mental Health Support 
 
This request is to increase funding to four residential safe houses, including one girl safe house 
on Hawaii Island and boys safe houses on Maui, Hawaii Island, and Oahu ($650,000).  This 
request also serves to provide specialized funding to increase mental health services to LGBTQ+

youth, a population identified as being at high risk for self-harm, substance abuse, behavioral 
and mental health issues, and becoming victims of abuse and trafficking ($200,000). 
 
In 2024, the Legislature provided the following amounts that are non-recurring:  This request is 
is restore the funds for the biennium and for the funds to be recurring as part of OYS' base 
budget: 
• Safe House boys $162,500 x 3 
• Safe House girls $162,500 x1 
• LGBTQ+ $200,000 
• Non-Eligible CAMHD Youth $150,000 
Total = $1,000,000 
 
In accordance with section 352D-D, HRS, OYS is responsible for providing services to at-risk 
youth and facilitating optimum service delivery, preventing delinquency, and reducing 
recidivism through prevention, rehabilitation, and treatment.  OYS creates opportunities for at-
risk youth to become productive, responsible citizens through community-based and family-
focused interventions.  Among these interventions are housing and mental health services for 
youth.  Since the pandemic, youth have been displaying increased criminogenic risk factors and 
behavioral and mental health issues. 
 
Additionally, OYS has worked with CAMHD to provide mental health treatment to youth who 
are not eligible for CAMHD services.  OYS' original 2017 contract was for $300,000 annually.  In 
2021, due to budget cuts, this contract was reduced to $60,000 annually.  In 2022, OYS 
increased funding to $150,000 annually to address the increased demand for mental health 
services for youth in the community.  However, this amount of funding is not meeting the 
needs of youth.  In the calendar year 2022, OYS received 49 referrals for services.  In only the 
first six months of 2023 (January - June), OYS received 56 referrals.  During this same period, 
costs for mental health services to these youth were $230,606.07 annually, well beyond the 
capacity of OYS' current contract costs.   
 
 
501YA-06:  Sex Trafficking Victims Support 
The current $400,000 funded by the 2024 Legislature is non-recurring under HMS 503.  This 
budget request is for $500,000 to be recurring to support victims who were sex trafficked on 
Oahu and Maui under HMS 501. 
$400,000 - Provides short-term, 30-day, or less emergency shelter services for youth 12-17 
years old who are suspected or determined to be victims of commercial sexual exploitation or 
labor trafficking.  This program accepts referrals from DHS CWS, the Family Court, law 
enforcement agencies, parents/guardians, other youth-serving agencies, and youth victims.  
Under section 352D-7.5, HRS, access to services will be made available by OYS to all youth at 
risk of being sexually exploited and to youth victims of sex trafficking at the Kawailoa Youth and

Family Wellness Center.  While the shelter has moved off campus, youth at Kawailoa continue 
to be referred to this program.   
 
Research shows a pathway of sexual exploitation, especially for girls involved in the juvenile 
justice system, including those committed to the Hawaii Youth Correctional Facility (HYCF).  The 
majority of female youth at HYCF have a history of sexual exploitation and abuse.  These 
emergency shelter services for exploited children have contributed significantly to the 
reduction of girls committed to HYCF over the past decade and reached a milestone of zero girls 
incarcerated in 2022 for 80 days.  Overall, there has been a significant reduction in youth, 
especially girls, being committed to HYCF, where the general population of girls is 1-5.  The 
current funding is non-recurring.  This budget request is for recurring funds as a part of OYS' 
base budget. 
$100,000 - Ongoing support to female children experiencing sexual exploitation and abuse on 
Maui.  Following the Maui wildfires, OYS saw an increase in female youth victims requiring 
emergency shelter and support.  With the temporary closure of Oahu's shelter and resulting 
cost savings, OYS diverted $100,000 to Maui.  However, funding to continue the emergency 
shelter for girls in Maui should be recurring and part of OYS' base budget.

require more detailed attention by our on-site staff Youth Correctional Officers.  Common 
medical issues include dental issues (lack of oral care), sexually transmitted diseases, heart

YCO positions would represent a partial restoration of 10 youth correctional facility positions (8 
Youth Correctional Officers, 1 Youth Corrections Supervisor, and 1 Social Worker III) that were 
abolished as part of Act 88, SLH 2021. 
In order to continue the development of the KYFWC campus, our current and future needs will 
be a Planner VI position to assist and manage the Kawailoa Youth and Family Wellness Center 
(KYFWC) programs.  Act 208 (SLH 2018), Relating to Juvenile Justice Reform, created the KYFWC 
for services and programs that may include but are not limited to mental health services and 
programs, substance abuse treatment programs, crisis shelters for homeless youth, crisis 
shelters for victims of human sex trafficking, vocational training, group homes, day treatment 
programs, aftercare, independent and family counseling services, educational services, and any 
other services and programs.  These programs require contractual management, organization, 
and systemic alignment to multiple state services for Hawaii's most vulnerable at-risk youth and 
vulnerable young adults.  The multitude of programs by collaborating state agencies and 
community service providers is a model that Hawaii can be proud of.  As KYFWC is adapting to 
the services youth need, the load of managing KYFWC is increasing, and we need a Planner VI 
position to ensure continued success on behalf of our youths.

224HS-01: Funds for Family Assessment Center 
 
Homelessness continues to persist as one of the most pressing issues facing Hawaii.  
Additionally, the demand for homeless services has steadily increased from 2022 to the 
present, reflecting the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.  During this period, the 
number of homeless individuals per the annual statewide Point in Time Count has increased by 
7% from 5,967 to 6,389.  Based on a review of data following the 2009 economic recession, 
homelessness is projected to continue steadily increasing for the next several years and is 
expected to impact both single adults and families with minor children.  Specifically, between 
2009 and 2016, the number of people experiencing homelessness increased from 5,782 to a 
high of 7,921, a 37% increase over the 7 years.  Accordingly, there is a need to sustain effective 
homeless services that emphasize placement into permanent housing to mitigate future 
increases in the number of individuals and families experiencing homelessness. 
  
This request will sustain funding for the Family Assessment Centers (FACs), which are a 
successful and critical tool to address homelessness specifically for families with minor children.  
The state framework to address homelessness includes a focus on a "Housing First" approach 
statewide.  The FAC is a model of low-barrier shelters utilizing the "Housing First" philosophy to 
quickly move families with minor children off the streets and into transitional shelters or 
permanent housing.  There are currently two FACs in operation - one in Waianae and one in 
Puna - that would be adversely impacted if funding for FAC services is not sustained.  
 
The first FAC in Kakaako opened in September 2016, accommodating 12-15 families (up to 50 
people) at any one time.  In the last eight years of operation under the management of Catholic 
Charities Hawaii, the center served 326 households, placed 52.67% into permanent housing, 
and increased the income for 59% of families served.

The original FAC in Kakaako closed in late 2022 when the city reclaimed control of the facility.  
To replace it, DHS relocated the FAC to a new site on O‘ahu.  During the interim year, the FAC 
operated remotely, focusing on supporting families who had previously exited the program to 
ensure they maintained their permanent housing.  The FAC later relocated to serve the 
Waianae Coast.  The Point in Time Count (PIT) reports indicated that Waianae had the largest 
percentage of unsheltered individuals on the island, with 27% or 630 individuals in 2023 and 
28% or 785 individuals in 2024. 
 
The relocated FAC in Waianae officially reopened on March 18, 2024.  From July 1, 2023, to 
June 30, 2024, the new FAC achieved a 100% housing placement rate by transitioning all eight 
families it served into permanent housing.  On average, the FAC in Waianae transitioned 
families into permanent housing within 77 days, or just under three months. 
 
In 2019, the Legislature passed Act 62, with an appropriated $800,000 for the operation of a 
second FAC.  DHS procured the services for a second FAC, operated by Neighborhood Place of 
Puna.  This center can accommodate up to 9 families (up to 27 people) at any one time.  This 
FAC was the first of its kind on a neighbor island.  From July 1, 2022, to June 30, 2023, the Puna 
FAC transitioned 21 of 32 families into permanent housing, achieving a 66% placement rate.  
Families moved into permanent housing within an average of 89 days or just under three 
months.  From July 1, 2023, to June 30, 2024, the FAC of Puna successfully transitioned 20 of 33 
families into permanent housing, achieving a 66% placement rate.  Families were moved into 
permanent housing in an average of 77 days, just under three months, which represents a 12-
day improvement over the previous year’s average.  In the last five years of operation, the Puna 
FAC served a total of 200 households, placed 49% into permanent housing, and increased the 
income for 54% of families served. 
 
A key benefit of the FACs is the focus on placements into permanent housing.  Additionally, 
FACs address the social determinants of health and provide case management services with an 
emphasis on building social capital.  Social capital can be described as increased peer support 
and a sense of community; connections to family, friends, and neighbors; participation in 
community and faith-based organizations; school and workplace connections; leadership and 
professional development programs; engagement with case managers or career coaches; and 
other social networks.  It produces information, emotional or financial support, and/or other 
resources.  Research shows that individuals with higher levels of social capital are happier and 
healthier, find better jobs, and live longer.  Communities with higher levels of social capital 
have higher educational achievement, faster economic growth, and less crime. 
 
The requested level of funding will support the continued operation of both the Waianae and 
Puna FACs.  While the FAC program targets homeless families with minor children, it is just one 
piece of a larger state strategy that includes other interventions (e.g., street outreach, rapid re-
housing, etc.) that address the broader population of homeless persons, including homeless 
youth and chronically homeless adults.

224HS-02: Funds for Housing First Program 
This request will sustain funding for the state Housing First program, which focuses on the most 
visible, chronically homeless population - the same population who frequently utilize 
healthcare services and cycles in and out of the criminal justice system.  Supportive case 
management services are key to moving chronically homeless individuals off of the streets, 
ensuring that they remain successfully housed, and reducing the utilization of high-cost 
emergency room services.  The Housing First program provides housing and supportive case 
management services with an emphasis on building the social capital of unsheltered, 
chronically homeless persons.  DHS currently contracts for state Housing First services in each 
major County - on Oahu, Hawaii island, Maui, and Kauai.  These services would be adversely 
impacted if funding for state Housing First is not sustained.  In particular, the clients who are 
currently in the program will likely be displaced back to homelessness if these supportive 
services are not continued. 
 
The state Housing First program has been active on Oahu for more than nine years and on the 
neighbor islands for more than seven years.  Currently, the program supports 258 chronically 
homeless individuals, boasting a housing retention rate of 91%, well above the national average 
of 80%.   
 
Between June 27, 2023, and June 26, 2024, the program successfully transitioned 36 individuals 
to permanent housing through its Move On strategy.  The Moving On strategy is a framework 
designed to help individuals transition from Housing First programs while ensuring their 
continued success and mobility.  It focuses on increasing program capacity by freeing up 
Housing First units for those in greater need and supporting tenant choice by acknowledging 
that the Housing First program may not be the final destination for everyone, thereby enabling 
more people to move on to other housing options. 
 
Historically, the state Housing First program has been funded on a year-to-year basis except 
during Legislature Session 2023, wherein it was funded for the 2023-2025 fiscal biennium.  It is 
critical that funding be recurring and sustained in the base budget.  Without sustained funding, 
the individuals who are currently housed in the program will be at immediate risk and will likely 
return to homelessness as program participants require supportive case management to 
remain housed.  Investment in a Housing First program keeps people housed (91% retention 
rate) and results in significant public cost savings over time.  A preliminary analysis by the 
University of Hawaii Center on the Family of a subset of state Housing First clients found that 
estimated healthcare costs for clients dropped an average of 43% in just six months following 
housing placement – from an average of $10,570 per client per month to $5,980 per client per 
month.   
 
Social capital is another component addressed through Housing First services.  Social capital can 
be described as increased peer support and a sense of community; connections to family, 
friends, and neighbors; participation in community and faith-based organizations; school and

workplace connections; leadership and professional development programs; engagement with 
case managers; and other social networks.  Individuals with positive social connections have 
access to information, emotional or financial support, and/or other resources.  Research shows 
that individuals with higher levels of social capital are happier and healthier, find better jobs, 
and live longer.  Further, communities with higher levels of social capital have higher 
educational achievement, faster economic growth, and less crime. 
 
While the state Housing First program targets the chronically homeless, it is one piece of a 
larger state strategy, which includes other interventions (e.g., street outreach, rapid re-housing, 
etc.) that address the broader population of homeless persons, including homeless youth and 
families. 
 
 
224HS-03: Funds for Outreach and Civil Legal Services 
This request will sustain funding for the Homeless Outreach and Civil Legal Services program.  
Homeless Outreach is the primary method to identify and assist unsheltered homeless 
individuals and connect them to other homeless services, such as shelter, Housing First, Rapid 
Re-Housing, and other interventions to help them transition off the streets or other public 
lands.   
This outreach effort is closely integrated with enforcement actions targeting visible homeless 
encampments on public lands.  To prevent merely displacing individuals, outreach providers 
collaborate with state agencies to move unsheltered persons into long-term housing solutions.   
Additionally, civil legal services enable outreach and other service providers to obtain 
identification documents for individuals experiencing homelessness who need state-issued 
identification to access housing and employment.  Sustained, year-round funding is crucial for 
maintaining and expanding outreach and civil legal services, as inconsistent funding could 
hinder efforts to manage the increasing number of unsheltered individuals.   
Outreach services include helping individuals obtain identification documents, find suitable 
housing, assist with job searches, and apply for public benefits.  Building strong relationships 
with those who have previously avoided services, outreach staff play a key role in connecting 
people to essential resources, addressing immediate needs, and ultimately reducing the 
negative impacts of rough sleeping and vagrancy arrests.  If homeless outreach and civil legal 
services are not sustained, this will dilute the state's ability to respond to unsheltered 
individuals and make it more challenging to maintain a focus on reducing unsheltered 
homelessness. 
Homeless outreach services have been provided to an average of 2,976 individuals each year 
since FY18, with 382 individuals, on average, placed into permanent housing from the streets.  
On average, another 1,718 individuals were placed into appropriate settings such as homeless

shelters.  Outreach performance and outcome measures target 15% or less for a return to 
homelessness, and Outreach services have exceeded expectations with an average rate of 
10.47%. 
Civil legal services assisted an average of 732 individuals each year since FY18, with an 84.5% 
success rate in obtaining vital documents and identification cards.  From June 15, 2023, to June 
14, 2024, civil legal services successfully secured 616 vital documents for 756 individuals, 
achieving an 81.4% success rate. 
Homeless outreach and civil legal services reflect a 'Housing First' approach to ending 
homelessness and remain a critical and challenging component of our current care system.  
While the Homeless Outreach and Civil Legal Services program specifically targets unsheltered 
homelessness, it is one piece of a larger state strategy, which includes other interventions (e.g., 
Family Assessment Centers, Housing First, rapid re-housing, etc.) that address the broader 
population of homeless persons that include homeless youth and families. 
Like the other strategies, this performance measure is aligned with the implementation of the 
DHS 'Ohana Nui strategy, which emphasizes building social capital as one of the pillars of the 
social determinants of health.  Consistent with the 'Ohana Nui strategy, homeless outreach 
services address the social determinants of health and provide case management services with 
an emphasis on building social capital.  Social capital can be described as increased peer 
support and a sense of community; connections to family, friends, and neighbors; participation 
in community and faith-based organizations; school and workplace connections; leadership and 
professional development programs; engagement with case managers; and other social 
networks.  It produces information, emotional or financial support, and/or other resources.  
Research shows that individuals with higher levels of social capital are happier and healthier, 
obtain permanent housing, find better jobs, and live longer.  Further, communities with higher 
levels of social capital have higher educational achievement, faster economic growth, and less 
crime. 
As noted above, homelessness remains a persistent and pressing issue facing Hawaii.  
Additionally, the demand for homeless services has steadily increased from 2022 to the 
present, reflecting the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.  During this period, the 
number of homeless individuals per the annual statewide Point in Time Count increased by 7% 
from 5,967 to 6,389.  Based on a review of data following the 2009 economic recession, 
homelessness is projected to continue steadily increasing for the next several years and is 
expected to impact both single adults and families with minor children.  Specifically, between 
2009 and 2016, the number of people experiencing homelessness increased from 5,782 to a 
high of 7,921, a 37% increase over the 7 years.  Accordingly, there is a need to sustain effective 
homeless services that emphasize placement into permanent housing to mitigate future 
increases in the number of individuals and families experiencing homelessness.

224HS-04: Funds for Rapid Re-Housing Program 
This request will sustain funding for the Rapid Re-Housing (RRH) program.  RRH is a nationally 
recognized best practice, and its core components are housing identification and location 
services, time-limited move-in and rental assistance, and short-term case management and 
services.  The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has long endorsed 
this practice as an effective way to end homelessness among families with minor children.   
 
In particular, RRH plays a key role in helping to maximize space in homeless shelters by 
targeting individuals and families currently staying in shelters and providing them additional 
support to quickly transition to more permanent housing.  By targeting homeless individuals 
and families who are currently in shelters, the RRH program accelerates the placement of 
families with children into more permanent housing and allows the state to maximize its 
existing shelter inventory.   
 
Currently, many family shelters are at maximum capacity and are experiencing a "backlog" 
because families are challenged to move quickly from homelessness to being housed with 
stability.  RRH assists in moving families much more quickly through shelter and into permanent 
housing.  For example, if a family came into a shelter with a dedicated source of income but 
without enough savings to afford the first month's rent and move-in costs, the RRH program 
could assess the family's sustainability and provide the financial support immediately to have 
the family either avoid entering or at least limit the amount of time spent in a homeless shelter.  
This approach is especially important for rural and neighbor island communities, which have 
limited shelter space.  In addition, this use of RRH recognizes that it is extremely cost-intensive 
to construct and fund additional homeless shelters and that the construction of new shelters is 
inconsistent with national best-practice approaches to addressing homelessness that minimize 
the number of interim transitions from homelessness to permanent housing.   
 
In addition to supporting homeless individuals and families with rental assistance and 
placement into housing, RRH also provides supportive services to assist a family in maintaining 
their housing.  If a family encounters difficulties with paying rent shortly after moving to 
permanent housing, the RRH program connects the family with appropriate resources and 
support to stabilize and maintain their permanent housing.  In this way, Rapid Re-Housing is 
effective in ending and preventing homelessness. 
 
The state's Rapid Re-Housing program has served an average of 1,468 individuals in 591 
households each year since FY18.  Between July 1, 2023, and June 30, 2024, 1,669 individuals in 
households received Rapid Re-Housing services, with a permanent housing rate of 60.7%.  This 
rate is derived from 1,014 individuals who exited RRH programs during the year.  Homeless 
Management Information System (HMIS) data indicates that the average duration from intake 
to permanent housing for individuals in RRH programs was 174 days or approximately five and 
a half months.  RRH services aim for a return-to-homeless rate of 15% or lower, and they have 
consistently exceeded this target with a rate of 12% each year.

Aligned with the DHS 'Ohana Nui Strategy, the RRH program addresses the social determinants 
of health and provides increased housing stability for families with minor children with case 
management services that emphasize building social capital.  Social capital can be described as 
increased peer support and a sense of community; connections to family, friends, and 
neighbors; participation in community and faith-based organizations; school and workplace 
connections; leadership and professional development programs; engagement with case

and/or other resources.  Research shows that individuals with higher levels of social capital are 
happier and healthier, obtain permanent housing, find better jobs, and live longer.  Further, 
communities with higher levels of social capital have higher educational achievement, faster 
economic growth, and less crime. 
 
While the state RRH program focuses on placing individuals and families into housing and 
providing support to sustain housing, it is one piece of a larger state strategy, which includes 
other interventions (e.g., Family Assessment Centers, Housing First, homeless outreach, and 
civil legal services, etc.) that address the broader population of homeless persons that include

236LC-01: Funds for Security Guards 
DHS Benefit, Employment and Support Services Division (BESSD) has processing centers, care 
licensing offices, and first-to-work offices statewide.  These processing centers house all the 
office assistants, eligibility workers, self-sufficiency and support services staff, human services 
professionals, and social workers who provide services and eligibility determination to most of 
our programs, including Supplemental Nutrition Program (SNAP), Temporary Assistance for 
Needy Families (TANF), Aged, Blind and Disabled payments, General Assistance Payments, Child 
Care, and First-to-Work. 
 
Security guards play a crucial role in the safety of all employees, clients, and visitors in each of 
our offices by ensuring a secure environment, and as a protective physical deterrent.  Their 
presence also prevents unauthorized access and criminal activity.  These contracted security 
guards work with the processing center staff to oversee who enters, exits, and moves around 
the facility.  With the presence of security guards, people within our offices feel safe, and 
employees feel valued at work, which boosts their morale, allowing them to focus on their 
work. 
 
Act 164, SLH 2023 appropriated additional funding for security guard services, though it is 
limited to FY24 and FY25.  The appropriation should be recurring and made part of the base 
budget.  The rate of security guard services has increased over the years, and currently, the rate 
per hour is $29.04.  With the re-opening of our offices post-pandemic, our lobbies are busier, 
and we are now utilizing a total of 28 security guards statewide.

DHS continues to maintain a presence in communities around the state to provide services 
efficiently and accurately.  For the residents of Wahiawa, North Shore, and the surrounding 
areas, our Wahiawa First-to-Work and Wahiawa Processing Center will soon be co-located in 
the new Wahiawa Civic Center.  This move will allow DHS to maximize the use of our allotted 
space and provide streamlined services to our clients.  The building of the new civic center 
started in October 2023 and is expected to be completed by the end of FY 2025.  With 
completion next year, DHS requires funds to move current offices to the civic center.  The civic 
center will also house offices for the Judiciary and the Department of Health. 
The funds being requested are to furnish the new space and for moving and disposing of 
equipment and furniture from the old offices.  It also includes expenses for the installation of 
phones and cabling of the new Wahiawa Civic Center, and the removal of cabling from the old 
offices.  This funding is required for DHS to relocate staff and all required equipment and other 
necessary items. 
As of September 2024, Wahiawa Processing Center and Wahiawa First-to-Work are currently 
serving a combined 2,727 households.  There will be 23 employees from the Processing Center 
and First to Work office that will be consolidated at the Wahiawa Civic Center.  Failure to fund 
the move may adversely impact operations for Wahiawa and impact the 2,700 clients receiving

Transferring the five positions will enable the division to function more efficiently and will 
support compliance with federal regulations.  The positions will also support more timely and 
accurate processing of public benefits, thereby improving services for clients and reducing the 
risk of federal penalties related to delays in timeliness and increases in payment errors.

and salary of position #31066, Office Assistant IV. 
The child-care subsidy program implements federal and state child-care subsidy programs to 
help families afford child care, reduce their child-care expenses, and provide equal access to 
high-quality care for both underserved and at-risk families.  The Child Care Subsidy Unit (CCSU) 
receives and processes applications; determines eligibility and issues child-care subsidy 
payments; provides technical assistance and resource and referral activities; and conducts 
background checks on all applicants, their household members, and licensed and registered 
providers to determine their risk with respect to children in care. 
Act 248, SLH 2022, approved 25 permanent positions and operating costs to implement the 
Child Care Subsidy (CCS) program within DHS with the intent to improve efficiency, timeliness, 
payment accuracy, and communication with families.  Subsequent to that legislative approval, 
the CCSU was established in January 2023 with approval to transfer one permanent Office 
Assistant (OA) IV position from the Oahu Section 2 Kapolei Processing Center to the CCSU to 
bring the total number of positions for this newly established CCSU to 26 positions.  The CCSU 
will service families statewide under a statewide model to be able to efficiently and effectively 
manage the statewide CCS caseload.  
The OA IV plays a key role in providing the CCSU clerical support to two CCSU Supervisors, 16 
Eligibility Workers (EW), and 6 Social Service Assistants (SSA) in managing the CCSU 
administrative duties and client-related activities, including but not limited to: 
1. Answering and/or routing incoming questions based on knowledge and understanding 
of the CCSU to address situations that may occur in the absence of the unity supervisors, 
referring visitors and callers to appropriate staff. 
2. Receiving and processing incoming mail and responding to routine correspondence.

action for not meeting federal timeliness standards for SNAP.  The five positions listed below 
will support increased efficiency in the overall operations of the BESSD, increase capacity to 
respond to and comply with federal requirements regarding program integrity and restitution 
of overpayments, and enable the SB to refine outreach, the call center, and business processes 
to increase timeliness and reduce instances of payment error in benefit processing.  
 
Purchasing Tech II 
BESSD Administrative Management Services Office (AMSO) and Support Services Office (SSO) 
had a Purchasing Technician position that was defunded in FY21 and unfortunately abolished in 
FY22.  This position is very crucial as it is the only purchasing technician for our division.  The 
position is responsible for purchasing supplies and equipment for the entire Division.  The 
position also reviews supplies and equipment requests from the Statewide Branch (SB) and 
recommends approval/disapproval or suggests alternatives/substitutes to the Staff Services 
Supervisor; conducts procurement of leased equipment such as multi-function devices, postage 
machines, and monthly air conditioning maintenance for SB units; assists in processing 
pCard/Purchase Orders (PO)’s and invoices for security guards, courier services, janitorial 
services, telephones, etc., assists with units' moves to other offices, and contacts the various 
vendors for moving services, equipment disposals, etc.  The Purchasing Tech position also 
processes inventory paperwork for the Division administrator's signature.  Since we currently 
do not have a purchasing technician position, all of these responsibilities are added to the 
duties of the Staff Services Supervisor, alongside managing several positions at the central files 
office.  In particular, funding the Purchasing Tech II position would better enable the division to 
support the operations of SB, which provides direct assistance to clients applying for and 
receiving SNAP and financial assistance benefits.  
  
Investigator III 
The primary function of the Restitution Control Staff (RCS) of the Investigations Office (INVO) is 
to establish and implement the Department's statewide program to control and enforce 
restitution due to DHS because of overpayments and over issuances made in the various public 
assistance programs administered by DHS.  One Investigator III position in this office was 
abolished in FY22. 
 
The primary purpose of the Investigator III positions is to provide investigative services in 
support of the recovery of monies due to the Department; locate persons of interest for other 
DHS program offices and other State Departments as requested; provide mandated support to 
the FBI Fleeing Felon Program; and conduct other investigations as directed.   
 
The workload for the Restitution Control Staff requires a minimum of three investigators. 
Additionally, due to the sensitivity of information in some of the tasks, access to the 
information is only granted to one investigator.  In the past, the workload was divided among 
three investigators to maintain efficiency, accuracy, and confidentiality.  For example, INVO 
receives an FBI fleeing felon list of over 1,000 pages, with at least 100 names on each page 
every three months.  The RCS Investigators must screen the list to identify individuals who have 

Department of Human Services 
March 4, 2025 
Page 44 of 94 
 
AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY AGENCY 
 
outstanding warrants and are residing in Hawaii.  Once they identify those individuals, they 
then must attempt to locate those individuals.  The tasks for completing this function are 
extensive and require the investigator to research various databases and coordinate with other 
agencies to verify and locate the individual.  
 
Other functions include but are not limited to screening restitution accounts for accuracy, 
providing testimony in bankruptcy proceedings, and identifying and locating family members of 
deceased account holders.  With only one Investigator III, RCS would not be able to continue to 
function efficiently and effectively and would have a negative impact on DHS’s ability to fulfill 
its obligations and oversight requirements mandated by FNS. 
 
Outreach Manager 
As we continue to provide services for the most vulnerable members of our community, SB 
coordinates outreach efforts with various community partners.  There has been an increased 
demand for eligibility staff to attend outreach events to assist with eligibility processing, 
including Rapid Response with the Department of Labor and Industrial Relations (DLIR) when 
businesses shut down or reduce operations and community service fairs.  Outreach staff assist 
attendees with applying for benefits and services, conduct and complete interviews, and 
provide answers to questions about programs or case status.  DHS is requesting a position to 
manage and oversee this service provision.   
 
The Outreach Manager would ensure staffing for outreach events, coordinate with the 
community partners, manage the field operations, and troubleshoot during events (including 
supervising staff during events, providing clarification on basic policy and procedures of 
determining eligibility, and assisting eligibility staff as needed), create and maintain policies and 
procedures for SB Outreach, continue to build partnerships within the community and manage 
logistics and equipment needs for events and operations.  Allowing someone to focus on this 
important outreach effort fully will also assist SB in more fully developing its outreach 
coordination and activities.  Residents will benefit from services in their communities that 
generally take place during non-traditional office hours.  It is the goal of SB to eventually have a 
separate group of eligibility staff that would devote their time to outreach in the community.   
 
 
903FA-03: Add 1.00 FTE and Funds for the Summer Electronic Benefits Transfer (Summer EBT) 
The Consolidated Appropriations Act 2023 (P.L. 117-328) authorized a permanent, nationwide 
Summer EBT program that began in 2024.  Branded as "SUN Bucks" in Hawaii, Summer EBT 
intends to reduce hunger and food insecurity for children who lose access to free and reduced-
price meals through the National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program during 
the summer when school is not in session. 
Hawaii’s participation in the new federal Summer EBT program required and continues to 
require a 50/50 match of state funds to federal funds to administer the program.  Act 155, SLH 

Department of Human Services 
March 4, 2025 
Page 45 of 94 
 
AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY AGENCY 
 
2024 established the Summer EBT program in DHS, subject to the availability of funds, and 
provided the general funds needed for the federal fund match to implement Summer EBT for 
FY2024-2025 that was used for the 2024 Summer break.  The inaugural Summer EBT program 
served approximately 90,000 children statewide by providing each child with a food benefit of 
$177 to purchase approved food items and address their food needs during the summer break 
period.  These benefits were 100% federally funded and totaled nearly $16 million in food 
purchasing benefits that could be spent at local food retailers.  Notably, each $1 of this benefit 
spent has a multiplier effect of generating $1.80 in economic stimulus for the local economy.  
This budget request completes the intent of Act 155, SLH 2024, by establishing permanent 
administrative funding for the continued operation of the Summer EBT program.  Act 155, SLH 
2024, authorized 1.00 FTE position in DHS to be the administrative and implementing lead for 
Hawaii's SUN Bucks program.  Act 155, SLH 2024, further appropriated funds for the contracting 
of the operational services and technical system development services. 
 
The Summer EBT contracts break down as follows: 
• $1,431,920     On-going system costs. 
• $1,344,000     Summer EBT/SUN Bucks Customer Service (call center & application    
processing); 
• $   500,000     EBT vendor costs; and 
• $   120,000     Notice printing and mail distribution. 
As mentioned previously, administration of this program requires a 50% state match.  Without 
the State match, the only alternative to consider is not to operate the program.  However, given 
the high cost of food, continuing access to federal nutrition benefits for school children on 
summer break is a priority to reduce food insecurity and child hunger.  
 
903FA-05: Funds for SNAP Smart Food Program 
Hawaii has an estimated food insecurity rate of 13.1%, with approximately 10.9% of Hawaii’s 
population receiving benefits from the SNAP program.  Food insecurity is associated with 
numerous adverse social and health outcomes and is increasingly considered a critical public 
health issue.  Key drivers of food insecurity include unemployment, poverty, and income 
shocks, which can prevent adequate access to food. 
Additionally, food prices in Hawaii continue to increase.   
To address food insecurity and rising food prices, DHS will implement the Smart Food 
supported by the Governor's office.  The Smart Food Program matches surplus food with local 
SNAP recipients.  This program will allow Hawaii food producers and retailers to make specific 
food items, including fresh produce, available at discounted prices to SNAP recipients in specific 
stores where surplus inventories are identified through a mobile application.  This virtual 

Department of Human Services

marketplace will coordinate the offers of food as digital coupons to be shared with participating 
SNAP recipients.  Moreover, the mobile application will deliver tailored nutrition information to 
SNAP recipients to encourage healthy food choices.  The State of Delaware will be the first state 
to use this mobile application, and Hawaii proposes to be the next State to implement this.  
The service will be done via contract.  The deliverable will be a mobile application that SNAP 
recipients could voluntarily enroll in that would provide them alerts of reduced-priced food 
items as well as access to other cost-saving information that would allow them to have greater 
purchasing options with their limited benefits. 
 
 
903FA-07: Funds for Benefits Eligibility Solution Ongoing Software Costs 
DHS is currently working on the development and implementation of its new Benefits Eligibility 
Solution (BES) eligibility system, which is the replacement eligibility system for the 
department's legacy Hawaii Automated Welfare Information (HAWI) eligibility system.  DHS 
expects to implement the BES statewide in late 2025.  BES will be the system to determine 
eligibility, authorize benefits, and provide ongoing eligibility case management for the 
department's public benefits programs, including Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program 
(SNAP), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), Temporary Assistance for Other 
Needy Families (TAONF), General Assistance (GA), and Aid to the Aged, Blind, and Disabled 
(AABD).  
Previous funding for maintenance & operations (M&O) for BES was appropriated initially in 
2018 and was adjusted last legislative session to add $288,177 A funds and $255,500 N funds.  
While implementation was initially scheduled for mid-2024, implementation has been delayed, 
and the M&O estimates have been reevaluated to include additional ongoing software costs at 
$2M per year on a recurring basis.  The additional $2M being requested includes annual Google 
Cloud subscription services supporting multiple environments (Engineering, Development, 
Testing, Integration, Staging, Production, Security, Training, and Disaster Recovery) that are 
necessary for the BES system modernization. 
In addition to this request, there is a separate one-time budget request (above) for $10M in 
FY26 for BES development and testing, as well as a legislative proposal to request a $5.4M 
Emergency Appropriation (EA) in FY25.  The EA is specifically to reinvest a portion of a federal 
penalty for payment errors to build additional functionality in BES aimed at improving the 
accuracy of SNAP benefit processing and reducing errors related to overpayments and 
underpayments.  All three requests are necessary to support the full development and 
implementation of BES. 
BES is especially critical to address the FNS penalty for failing to achieve a SNAP payment error 
rate for federal fiscal year 2023 at or below the national average of 11.68%.  The BES will 
include necessary functionality to reduce and prevent payment errors, such as an automated

rules engine that will increase efficiency and streamline existing processes.  If BES development 
is not completed and does not have sufficient funding for ongoing operation and maintenance 
of critical BES environments, Hawaii will be at increased risk of high payment error, potentially 
delayed timeliness in processing benefits, and may be at increased likelihood of incurring 
additional financial penalties from FNS in future years.

802GA-02: Randolph Sheppard Revolving Account Ceiling Request 
This request is to permanently increase the revolving fund appropriation ceiling for DVR’s (HMS 
802) Randolph-Sheppard Revolving Account from $1,330,200 to $2,000,000.  Additional 
Governor discretion to raise the ceiling in increments of $1,000,000 as needed would also 
facilitate the administration of the Randolph-Sheppard program. 
 
The Randolph-Sheppard (or “Blind Vending”) program exists to provide quality employment 
opportunities for blind entrepreneurs licensed by the State of Hawaii DHS/DVR/Ho`opono-
Services for the Blind Branch (the “SLA” or State Licensing Agency”).  The Randolph-Sheppard 
program is mandated to continuously seek new opportunities for requesting to keep the ceiling 
for the Randolph-Sheppard S-350 Account at $2 million.  The account funds are used to assist 
licensed blind vendors statewide at county, state, and federal locations with costs of 
renovations, purchases/repair of equipment, supplies, vendor benefits, and professional 
development.  This includes new facilities, as well as providing necessary upgrades, 
renovations, equipment, and supplies to existing facilities, which can range from small sundry 
shops to larger-scale cafeterias on county, state, and federal properties.   
 
The income that funds this account comes primarily from the Honolulu Airport Settlement 
Agreement and non-assigned vending machines on federal property and is sufficient to 
maintain the budget at $2 million permanently.  The Randolph-Sheppard Revolving Account is 
used for these purposes, as well as the overall provision of management services, training, 
equipment, retirement and medical benefits, and travel for blind vendors.  The ever-increasing 
cost of medical services causes a need to increase annual medical benefits for the vendors.

Special Fund 
The purpose of this request is to establish a special fund appropriation ceiling in HMS 401 for 
the Nursing Facility Sustainability Special Fund, which is established in Chapter 346F, HRS.  This 
appropriation ceiling was established in Act 109, SLH 2023, and not in the executive budget act.  
This special fund collects revenue from the Nursing Facility Sustainability Program, which was 
made permanent in 2023.  Expenditures from this special fund will directly support Hawaii's 
nursing facilities, to maintain access to care for Medicaid recipients and allow these facilities to 
continue to serve uninsured or underinsured patients.   
 
401PE-02: Establish Special Fund Appropriation Ceiling for the Hospital Sustainability Special 
Fund 
The purpose of this request is to establish a special fund appropriation ceiling in HMS 401 for 
the Hospital Sustainability Special Fund, which is established in Chapter 346G, HRS.  This 
appropriation ceiling was established in Act 110, SLH 2023, and not in the executive budget act.   
This special fund will collect revenue from the Hospital Sustainability Program, which was made 
permanent in 2023.  Expenditures from this special fund will directly support Hawaii's private 
hospitals, to maintain access to care for Medicaid recipients and allow these hospitals to 
continue to serve uninsured or underinsured patients.   
 
401PE-03: Sustain Increase Payments for most Medical - Professional Services  
This request is to sustain the increased reimbursement rates for most medical professional 
services (e.g., Doctor's visits) to 100% of the Medicare fee schedule.  Without this increase, the 
fee schedule would be reduced back to approximately 60% of the Medicare fee schedule for 
most of the medical/professional services.  This request makes these funds a recurring item in 
the base budget as funds appropriated for this increase in fiscal biennium FY23-FY25 were non-
recurring.

401PE-04: Increase Provider Payment Rates for Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) Services 
This request is to provide recurring funding increases for Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) 
services.  The appropriation in 2024 was non-recurring.  In 2023, Senate Concurrent Resolution 
132, Senate Resolution 152, and House Resolution 207 requested DHS to take necessary steps 
to ensure adequate provider rates are established for ABA services.  DHS contracted Miliman to 
do the study, which was completed and submitted to the Legislature in December 2023.  The 
study uses a payment model based on an Independent Rate Model methodology, which means 
building the component parts of the rates from the ground up.  Key components of this rate 
study included outreach and engagement with ABA provider agencies, providers, and their 
associations, collecting provider agency cost and wage survey data, and getting feedback on 
draft rate calculations.  The rate study provided three scenarios (Scenario 1, 2, and 3), and this 
request is based on Scenario 1.  
401PE-05: Increase In-Home HCBS 
This request is to authorize federal funds to increase rates for in-home Home and Community 
Based Services (HCBS).  In 2022, the Legislature requested that the DHS study the feasibility of 
increasing rates for Community Care Family Foster Homes, Adult Residential Care Homes, and 
other Home and Community Based Services (HCBS).  As a result, the Med-QUEST Division 
worked with actuaries to do the rate study.  A key part of the rate study included stakeholder 
outreach and engagement with HCBS providers and their associations, collecting provider cost 
and wage survey data, and getting provider feedback on draft rate calculations.  Not 
surprisingly, the provider surveys showed significant wage pressure given the current labor 
market.  The rate study methodology used wage and salary data for direct care staff and 
supervisors, employee-related expenses, transportation and administration, program support, 
overhead, and Bureau of Labor and Industry Wage Indices to pay for employee benefits such as 
health insurance.  The final rate study was presented in December 2022 with three options for 
levels of funding - Low, Medium, and High.  This request represents the "Low" option for the In-
Home HCBS services.   
These services provide eligible members with daily living services and supports (meal 
preparation, cleaning, bathing, community residential, home modifications, personal care) that 
help individuals live in the community or in their own homes instead of in institutional (nursing 
facility) care.  The Legislature provided funding to increase the rates for all of the other Home 
and Community Based Services.  The In-Home service increases, even at the "Low" option, 
reflects the competition for workers for this type of work (e.g., the hospitality sector).  Without 
the increase, it will become increasingly difficult to find personal care workers needed for our 
kupuna and individuals with disabilities wishing to remain living in their own homes.  If people 
cannot remain in their own homes, they will likely need more support in a more costly setting 
such as a nursing facility or other community residential setting.

The general fund portion of this request will come from the existing general fund appropriation 
for HMS 401. 
401PE-06: Add General Funding for Death Benefits Program 
In 2024, Act 108 appropriated $277,600 to the DHS, Med-QUEST Division, to increase payments 
for the cost of the mortuary, crematory, or hydrolysis facility services for unclaimed dead 
human bodies from $800 to $1,600.  Funding was only appropriated for FY 2025, so this request 
is to include the funds in the base budget on a recurring basis to make this increase permanent. 
401PE-07: Add General Funding for Child Wellness Incentive Pilot Program 
This request appropriates funds to the Med-QUEST Division's budget for the Child Wellness 
Incentive Pilot Program established in Act 127, SLH 2022.  Act 127, SLH 2022, makes a $50 
payment to each state Medicaid benefit recipient for each completed well-child examination of 
that recipient parent's child, provided that only one payment may be made per child each year.  
Med-QUEST requested and received an appropriation in the Fiscal Biennium FY23-FY25 budget, 
but this funding was designated as non-recurring.  This program is established for five years, 
ending on June 30, 2027; thus, funding needs to be included in the Med-QUEST budget in order 
for the program to continue to make these incentive payments through June 20, 2027.

301SA-01:  Add Funds for Comprehensive Child Welfare Information System (CCWIS) 
This budget request is the first request for funding of maintenance and operations necessary 
for HI-THRIVE.  The funding will be used to procure a vendor to provide maintenance and 
operations so that HI-THRIVE runs smoothly and does what it is expected to do. 
A modernized data system, with the use of current technology, is needed for Child Welfare 
Services (CWS).  CWS continues to move forward with the implementation of its HI-THRIVE data 
system (aka the Comprehensive Child Welfare Information System (CCWIS)).  HI-THRIVE is 
expected to provide the technological ability to access the system remotely, to be more user-
friendly, to provide real-time data for a more efficient way of doing practice, and a means of 
having more accurate data needed in decision-making and progress monitoring. 
HI-THRIVE is at the stage where the first phase of implementation should be in place by the end 
of Spring 2025.  Once that is done, it will be necessary to have funding to provide the 
maintenance and operations (M&O) necessary to ensure the computer system runs 
smoothly.    M&O will also troubleshoot identified issues that may prevent the system from 
optimal operations.   
The funding includes the costs for various software licenses, e.g., Adobe eSign, Oracle Rule, 
Azure Integration, Dell Boomi, etc., which are necessary to meet the needs of the practice.  The 
funding request also takes into account inflation and possible unanticipated reasonable 
expenses related to maintaining and operating HI-THRIVE, e.g., replacing incompatible 
equipment, updating current programs, etc.  The amount requested is appropriate given the 
current stage of HI-THRIVE and the size of the system.  Federal reimbursement for up-front 
costs is also available at the appropriate Title IV-E reimbursement rate. 
Investing in a new system is critical in meeting the demands of daily operations and provides 
the ability to access and use data more effectively.  Maintaining a computer system so that it

operates correctly is critical to documentation and communication.  Without this funding, if 
there are problems with the HI-THRIVE, there is no immediate remedy to resolving it; CWS will 
not have a data system that is necessary to perform the essential protective services and 
effectively help the children and families we serve.   
There are no alternatives.  M&O is a necessary part of having a functional data system. 
301SA-02: Child Protective Services Shortage Differential for Recruitment and Retention 
The work that Child Welfare Services (CWS) workers do is vital to keeping children safe and 
thriving while working to reunite them with their families as soon as possible or find an 
alternative permanent home when families cannot be reunified.  The vacancy rate of CWS has 
remained at least 30% for the past four years and efforts to decrease the vacancy rate have 
made little impact.   
This workforce capacity issue with CWS is a nationwide problem.  Without a shortage 
differential, recruitment and retention will remain challenging, and vacancies will continue to 
increase as more workers become eligible to retire, find higher-paying jobs, or resign due to the 
challenges of the job and working conditions.  Non-government employers can offer wages that 
are much more competitive than the salaries of positions in CWS.  Many critics of CWS point to 
the capacity issue as a factor in child death, poor and untimely assessments, and delays in 
reunifying children with their families.  Without this funding, CWS will continue to struggle to 
fill vacancies and retain experienced staff.   
The additional workload adds more stress to already demanding jobs, which leads to burnout.  
New recruits also decline job offers to accept higher paying jobs.  The Legislature previously 
appropriated funds for a shortage differential; however, it was a non-recurring expense and 
only for professional staff, e.g., line workers in social worker positions.   
This request is to make the shortage differential part of the base budget and to include CWS 
support staff as well.  Vacancies of support staff positions are also problematic. and those 
positions are critical to meeting the expectations of all the work that needs to be done by CWS. 
While the professional staff does the assessments for investigations and case management, it is 
the support staff that arranges for medical appointments, transports and supervises visits, 
completes all the paperwork for travel, makes referrals and completes applications for services, 
makes copies of reports for hearings, and keep the physical files organized and up-to-date, 
amongst many other things necessary to meet the daily operations of CWS.  It is anticipated 
that to build and stabilize the workforce so that CWS can operate using best practices, the 
differential will continue to be needed in the years to come to increase the recruitment and 
retention of CWS workers.   
Alternatives to a shortage differential are to increase the salaries of the CWS positions or to 
offer regular financial incentives as recruitment and retainment tools.

  HMS 601 – Adult Protective and Community Services 
 
 
601TA-01: Adult Protective and Community Services Computer System Build 
This request is for $550,000 in recurring funds to continue the development of an information 
system for the Adult Protective and Community Services Branch (APCS).  In 2020, APCS began 
working with a contracted provider, the University of Hawaii, Maui College, on the vision, 
design, and build of a new and updated technology infrastructure to address the specific needs 
of Hawaii’s APCS program.  The current CPSS system is antiquated, having been conceived and 
implemented over 30 years ago.  It was created primarily for the State’s Child Welfare Services 
Branch programs and is modified in small measures for APCS.  Due to the age of the system and 
because it was never intended for Adult Protective Service data, it has been and remains 
inadequate for capturing information that is needed both internally as well as for state and 
federal reporting.  It also results in laborious, ineffective, and time-consuming work for staff, 
who need a system that is responsive, portable, and effective for the work we do in this 
modern age. 
The UH Maui College Software Development Center is working closely with APCS and continues 
to develop a new, single-entry system of record with identified functional program 
requirements, including modularized components from intake to investigatory abuse analysis 
and determination, retrieval of information to generate protective service documents, and 
ability to retrieve and display protective determination evidence expediently.  We utilize 
departmental and contracted technical information technology (IT) support for the APCS new 
system of record, termination of data entry into the legacy system, and the ability to retrieve 
old data from the legacy system.  
APCS has relied heavily on the beginning phases of the system, built on a series of Federal 
Grants (CRSA and ARPA) awarded to the program.  Now that these grants are ending, we must 
continue to build upon the momentum and see the system-build project to fruition.  For this, 
we will need State funding in the amount of $550,000 built into our base budget.  We will utilize 
these funds to continue the progress in developing a comprehensive system for assessment, 
investigation, case management, referral management, reporting, and business intelligence.

Many of the components are already in place, including the intake subsystem and a web-based 
reporter form coupled with auto-population of information into the APCS worker’s intake 
report, making the reporting of abuse and screening process more efficient and timely, as well 
as an assessment tool to identify clients’ areas of risk and needs, coupled with case 
management processes to reinforce that clients are supported with referrals and/or linkages to 
access needed goods and/or services.   
Without adequate funding, this important project would likely be halted, and APCS would be 
left without a system of record as the CPSS system is phased out.  APCS not having what is 
being requested may result in a negative impact on the most vulnerable people we service in 
our state, as APCS will not be able to access cases as readily, not be able to maneuver quicker 
to respond, and not be more mobile.  We respectfully request the Legislature's support for 
APCS to reach our goal to adapt and change our environment so we can continue/improve 
service to the public efficiently and effectively. 
The current antiquated system hinders the ability to serve and protect vulnerable adults.  APCS 
needs a system that is user-friendly and supports staff in performing their important work 
efficiently and successfully.  The current system is DOS-based and limited in its data capacity as 
well as in its adaptability.  Very little can be done to improve upon the system to meet the 
current demands; it is counter-intuitive and is very difficult to train staff to use, and largely 
inaccessible outside the traditional office space where it is housed with the mainframe system.  
The system lacks built-in logic, requiring staff to perform many tedious steps, such as data code 
entry and navigating multiple screens, to capture documentation of incoming reports of abuse 
and investigations.   
APCS needs a system that is both responsive and understandable to the current workforce and 
that enables us to access information and input data outside the traditional office space.  As 
social workers and nurses, most of the work that is performed is done “in the field”. Without 
the ability to access information or input data remotely, our work is delayed and less efficient.  
APCS needs a system that supports our ability to protect vulnerable adults seamlessly, whether 
working in the office or remotely.

901MA-01: Additional Funds for Training 
The need for training is essential in building capacity for a stable and competent workforce.  
This request will provide the funding to enhance the training resources available to staff in the 
Division.  For the past four years, the Division has been trying to enhance the capability of the 
Staff Development Office, with limited success.  Audits and comprehensive quality 
improvement assessments identified the need to provide a better curriculum to train staff 
regularly as one of the key factors in building staff capacity and competency.   
 
Despite receiving technical assistance to improve on the training, the Division recognizes the 
need to seek out services from external experts to train its trainers and to create a curriculum 
that is evidence-based, comprehensive, and better suited to the needs of the current staff.  
Without external expertise, it will be a challenge to provide the skills and knowledge to move 
the Division towards a more efficient and knowledgeable workforce.   
 
Other states similar to Hawaii in terms of number of staff have training academies and staff 
development teams that are double the size of Hawaii's.  The expectation of the community is 
to provide the necessary training to staff so that they become more competent in the work 
they do.  The training will provide a safety curriculum, cultural training to serve families better, 
legal training so workers can be more aware of legal rights, and enhancement of their 
knowledge about applicable statutes, administrative rules, and policies and procedures that 
impact their daily work.  Training to stay up-to-date with best practices must also be provided, 
as well as training on trauma-informed approaches and self-care to address the concerns 
related to burnout. 
 
Nationwide, states are facing a shortage of workers, and without the proper training and 
support, workers are quick to leave to find less demanding jobs.  This Division, which includes 
Child Welfare Services and Adult Protective and Community Services, needs to build and 
stabilize its workforce to keep vulnerable children and adults safe.  Training will assist in 
providing the skills, knowledge, and support to retain workers.  Without the enhanced training 
that this funding would be used for, the Division will be unable to meet the training demands of 
its workers and will continue to be unable to recruit and retain employees.

The time to seek expertise from external sources to assist with and improve training needs is 
now if the improvements demanded by the community are to be met.  Otherwise, the lack of 
training will continue to be a problem that will be scrutinized by the public and put the State in 
a vulnerable position. 
901MA-02: Add funds for Security Measures for the Social Services Division 
Threats and harassment to workers in the Division have increased, requiring the Department of 
Law Enforcement (DLE) to provide sheriff presence in offices and periodic patrolling by the 
sheriff in sheriff's vehicles.  The Court also issued protective orders to keep targeted individual 
staff safe.  Additionally, staff have had to make police reports related to threats about shooting 
workers, written attacks targeting workers on social media, and protests being held outside of 
offices due to fear of harm and/or threat to their physical safety. 
 
DLE conducted an assessment of safety measures available, and additional funding is requested 
for the purchase of walk-in metal detectors, wand metal detectors, increased security presence, 
and patrolling, panic buttons in each of the offices, and software applications that can be 
downloaded on a worker's phone so that their location can be found if they need assistance 
while out in the field, doing their work. 
 
There have been incidents of aggressive clients walking right into offices to confront 
workers.  Protective screens at the front desk and doors with better locks, which can prevent 
the public from walking directly into offices, need to be installed in various offices to mitigate 
easy access to office spaces.  The funds would also be used to purchase and install security 
cameras inside of office as well as in the parking lots where State vehicles are parked.  There 
are increased incidents of state cars being stolen and/or tampered with after work hours. 
 
This is the first time the Division is making this type of request.  It is necessary to increase 
security measures to protect workers so they are and can feel safe and comfortable while 
working in the office and out in the field.  If workers do not feel safe, they may look for 
employment elsewhere, which is detrimental to the work that needs to be done and increases 
the workloads and stress of the remaining staff.

777HH-01: Add Funding for Kauhale 
This request is for $50 million a year to fund the construction and operation of Kauhale over 
fiscal biennium 2025-2027 (FB 25-27). 
 
Despite necessary investments in outreach, temporary shelter, and transitional housing, the 
number of “unsheltered” homeless on the street continued to climb as of January 2024; 
however, SOHHS has since reduced homelessness in Hawaii by over 500 in less than one year.  
Bringing an end to homelessness requires that, in addition to these essential services, we also 
invest in new approaches to housing and healing people for the long term.  Without long-term 
space for people to transition into, homeless individuals will continue to cycle in and out of 
shelters and temporary spaces, waiting months and years for placement into long-term housing 
where they can heal and grow.   
 
Kauhale offers one such solution.  Kauhale or “village-style” housing is typically envisioned as 
tiny homes, prefabricated homes, or other modest, low-cost housing units with bathrooms and 
kitchens that are shared by multiple units.  Kauhale are more affordable to construct than 
typical transitional or permanent housing due in part to the use of existing home units and 
shared baths and kitchens.  In addition to lowering development costs, there are communal 
baths, communal living spaces, kitchens with shared space for cooking and eating, recreation, a 
garden for growing and sharing food, and other activities so that it will reduce the physical 
footprint of development and can help to foster a sense of community cooperation and shared 
responsibility.  A Kauhale could also be created in an existing apartment, dormitory, or office 
building, as long as there is a communal living space, a kitchen, and bathrooms.  When we build 
Kauhale using existing homes, apartments, condos, and/or office spaces, we reduce costs 
significantly because we do not need to place other infrastructure like water, sewer, and 
electricity.

The Kauhale pilot project was inspired by successful community-based efforts to house and 
heal people using communal design and operations.  Leading examples include Hui Mahiai Aina 
in Waimanalo, Kama Oku Kauhale in Kalaeloa, and Puuhonua O Waianae in Waianae.    
  
Kauhale can be created through partnerships between the state, counties, and private entities.   
For instance, a county may have usable land, private donors may be willing to fund 
construction, and the state may contract with a community organization to operate the village.  
Alternatively, a church may have land and be willing to operate a kauhale but need help from 
the county for infrastructure and from the state to pay for vertical construction.  The goal is for 
state kauhale funds to fill funding gaps rather than shoulder the full cost of kauhale 
construction and operation.   
 
The Administration is currently assessing the viability of Kauhale projects and sites.  Our goal in 
January 2024 was to establish a minimum of 12 kauhale in the next three years, with six on 
Oahu and 2 in each of the neighbor island counties before the end of 2025.   
 
Today we have surpassed that target and have upgraded our projected target to 24 Kauhale by 
the end of 2025 and no less than 30 Kauhale before the end of Governor Green's first term 
(2026). 
 
To date, we have built 16 Kauhale within 10 months (January 2024 to October 2024): Waikiki 
Vista with 120 beds (Homeless families), Salvation Army Hilo with 25 beds, Middle Street with 
19 beds, PaePae Hou-Wilson Street with 24 beds (drug detox – rehabilitation), Village of 
Redemption (re-entry) 20/24 with aquaponic and hydroponic features, Fernhurst YWCA with 29 
beds (Women’s re-entry), HI Public Housing (medical respite), Cedar Church Kalihi with 26 beds 
(Kupuna & Medical Respite), Ka Malu Ko’olau with 34 beds (Windward), Pu’uhonua O Nene 
(built-in 2023), Iwilei FHB with 32 beds inside (Medical Respite) and 30 tiny homes outside 
(Transitional Housing), Iwilei Kauhale with 54 tiny homes, Iwilei Resource Center with 100 beds, 
Maui Medical Respite, with 10 beds, US Vets Waianae (60 beds for families and single Adults), 
and House of Redemption 2 on Halina Street (Re-entry). 
 
This is the list of upcoming Kauhale: 1. Youth Kauhale with 20 beds (First Lady Jaime Green’s 
vision); 2. YMCA Atkinson First Kauhale for Diversion/Re-entry with 30 beds; 3. YMCA Nuuanu 
has 72 beds, Housing instability; 4. 550 Halekauwila with 80 beds, Diversion/Re-entry; 5. 
Kaneohe Windward with 11 bedrooms, fully ADA-compliant residence for Medicaid, Hospice, 
and Palliative care patients; 6. Kauai, Mahelona, Homeless with 24 beds; 7. Edwin Thomas 
Building, Chinatown, 30 Units Permanent Supportive Housing for Kupuna; 8. Cedar Church 
Waianae, Homeless, 100 beds; and 9. YMCA Waianae, 25 tiny homes. 
 
SOHHS has housed many people so far - approximately 563 people/beds.  At our current pace, 
we will secure over 1,500 beds for individuals experiencing homelessness before the end of 
2026.

First Lady Jamie Green is a part of the SOHHS Team as she is currently working with our office 
to open a youth Kauhale by November 2024, serving 18 homeless youth in the downtown area. 
She and Governor Green have helped SOHHS in presenting a $235,000 grant to Residential 
Youth Services and Empowerment (RYSE), a nonprofit organization dedicated to youth services 
and empowerment, which offers emergency shelter for Hawaii's homeless youth. 
 
Additionally, SOHHS is also in the process of partnering with other nonprofit organizations for 
youth kauhale, as well as hospice and palliative care. 
  
Construction costs for Kauhale will vary widely depending upon the design of the Kauhale and 
how much infrastructure and site work is needed for a particular property.  Some sites may only 
require renovations to existing structures or installation of prefabricated homes, while others 
may require new construction and installation of water and sewer lines.  Our estimate is an 
average capital cost per kauhale of $2.5 million, with a wide range around that average 
figure.  For 12 Kauhale over 3 years, the total cost would therefore be $30 million.  We aim to 
house an average of 75 residents per Kauhale for a total of 900 people housed.  This reflects a 
per-person cost of $33,000 to house an individual, far below typical development costs for 
housing a similar number of people.  
  
Operating costs for a Kauhale/ohana zone pilot program may initially be similar to operating 
costs for shelters or transitional housing projects of a similar size.  For example, transitional 
housing for 75 people costs approximately $2.08 million annually to operate, based on 
estimates from homeless service providers.  Total annual operating costs for 12 kauhale under 
these assumptions would be $25 million.   Note that some of these costs will be covered by 
resident rents.  It may also be possible to blend state funding with other sources of funding for 
Kauhale operations.   
 
We aim to demonstrate that Kauhale operating costs can be reduced over time as residents 
(with help from housed community supporters) grow their capacity to assume roles and 
responsibilities for aspects of village operations such as security, groundskeeping, maintenance, 
and community governance.  Increasing resident participation and ownership of village 
operations will reduce annual costs and their sense of ownership and responsibility.  At the 
same time, with stable housing, residents will have greater opportunities to increase their 
incomes through education and employment. 
 
This is a pilot program to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness and impact of Kauhale.  As such, 
there are no prior expenditures.  
 
Key performance metrics of the Kauhale pilot program will be the number of homeless 
individuals housed, the number who retain their placement in a kauhale, and the cost of 
housing individuals in a kauhale compared to other alternatives.

This is a new initiative that provides a complement to existing services and housing options.  
Ending homelessness requires investing in long-term affordable communities and trying new

777HH-BF1: Operating Costs for SOHHS 
 
This request is for the operation costs for SOHHS.  Act 164, SLH 2023, as amended by Act 230, 
SLH 2024, shows that the funds for travel, office supplies, cell phone line, miscellaneous other 
current expenses, staff training, and registration, facilitation or consulting contract, routine and 
maintenance of machines, office furniture and equipment are non-recurring funds.  These 
funds are necessary for the operation of SOHHS in FB 25-27.

904AA-01: Add Information Technology Budget to Support IT Operations & Modernizations.  
This request supports department IT operations and modernization.  Today, the public is used 
to having online access at any time and from anywhere, quickly and seamlessly.  Government 
services have not always been designed with the public’s needs and priorities in mind.  Many 
programs struggle to keep up with or stay ahead of our constituent needs, as external 
conditions change much faster than policy, rules, or laws can be adjusted.   
 
As we look to move beyond the COVID-19 public health emergency, DHS must continue to 
make investments in technology and its technology workforce to deliver simple, seamless, and 
secure customer experiences more in line with common consumer experiences we are 
accustomed to in our personal lives.  Whether through the provision of DHS benefits, programs, 
and services or the support provided to the divisions and agencies that deliver them, our 
collective commitment is the same: to improve the well-being of Hawaii’s families and 
communities.

Our implementation of ‘Ohana Nui aims to make strategic, intentional changes that enable us 
to reach our commitment even more effectively.  Irrespective of people’s age, digital ability, 
financial situation, disability, education, or English proficiency, our residents need a 
government that understands who they are, what they need, and how best to deliver for them.  
As such, every interaction between DHS and the public is an opportunity to show that the 
government can and will deliver the services people expect and deserve. 
 
The investment decisions made today about how to shape, direct, and secure our infrastructure 
set the foundation for decades into the future.  We must proactively plan to ensure we are 
positioned to react to the economic uncertainty of our local economy, rising inflation, potential 
recession, and the financial stock market impacts as the economy eventually recovers, both in 
the near and long term.  Poorly designed, out-of-date, and inefficient government services are a 
burden to the workforce and the residents we serve.  DHS must also compete with the highly 
competitive private sector to attract, hire, retain, develop, train, and empower talented 
individuals who are well-suited and well-prepared to face the challenges that we will face over 
the next five to ten years.  As one of the largest employers in the state, we must take what we 
have learned from the pandemic and post-pandemic nationwide workforce and workplace 
trends to make the department and the Hawaii state government an ideal, modern, and 
forward-thinking employer. 
‘Ohana Nui is a proven approach that capitalizes on Hawaii’s unique multigenerational family 
structure and provides a framework for human service delivery that positions whole families for 
a chance at greater well-being.  Translated as extended or large family, ‘Ohana Nui is an 
adaptation of the national two-generation approach.  The approach addresses the needs of 
children, parents, and grandparents early and concurrently, resulting in better outcomes for the 
family.  Practically speaking, this philosophy requires us to tear down our silos, think beyond 
the limitations of funding streams, and work across divisions, programs, and teams. 
With the support of ETS and the IT Project Advisory Committee (PAC) throughout the COVID-19 
pandemic, DHS has proven that we can successfully provide digital services quickly and 
efficiently by using technology to power outstanding experiences, engaging with our private-
sector partners and nonprofit organizations, and collaborating with other state and county 
agencies to reduce the burdens of interacting with government by simplifying both public-
facing and internal processes to improve efficiency, and empowering the workforce so that 
they can best deliver services from anywhere at any time.  The primary focus was on urgent 
actions to keep our networks and systems up and running and to build additional capacity to 
increase our online capabilities to as many as possible.  DHS kept operating throughout the 
pandemic, maintaining access to Hawaii residents while keeping clients and staff safe. 
DHS made significant investments leveraging emergency COVID and ARPA funds and grant 
funds from federal funding partners such as the Administration for Children and Families (ACF), 
FNS, and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to digitize several applications

while increasing cybersecurity, antifraud, automation, artificial intelligence, and IT services.  
DHS has accelerated the adoption and use of secure cloud infrastructure and services to 
establish a platform for highly agile and responsive technical infrastructure that can easily 
expand and contract as resource needs change.   
As more legacy and paper-based systems are modernized and made accessible to the public 
over the internet, the outdated systems and technical debt accumulated over decades limit the 
effectiveness of government and our ability to implement modern security practices as we 
continue to increase our online footprint.  Continued investments are needed to provide new 
features and online capabilities, technology that enhances customer service capabilities, 
provides more resiliency in telecommunications and networks, and double down on 
automation and integration to remove wasted time in manual data entry and inefficient tasks 
that span across multiple systems so that the workforce can focus on delivering the benefits 
and services the public need. 
Cybersecurity - $500,000  
Cybersecurity management, monitoring, and detection tools, and training for Security staff and 
DHS employees to address data loss or theft, hacker, and ransomware attacks to ensure DHS 
remains compliant with federal, state, and local requirements and regulations. 
Secure Cloud Infrastructure -  $250,000  
Secure Government Cloud subscription for sensitive or other protected data or systems  
Telecommunications and Network Redundancy - $200,000 
To provide multiple dedicated, high-speed network transport services between DHS offices, 
DHS computing data centers, and the public cloud services that DHS receives from Google and 
Microsoft. 
Antifraud and Identity Proofing - $650,000 
Software and Services that provide electronic identity proofing for online applications that 
minimize, detect, and help prevent fraudulent applications, block known bad internet systems 
and networks, and Antifraud Analytics solutions that assist DHS investigations to prevent and 
detect potential fraudulent claims for food, financial, and Medicaid health insurance benefits.  
DHS distributes over $3 billion each year in federal and state funds to support the nutrition, 
financial, and health insurance benefit programs to nearly one-third of Hawaii's residents.   
Software-based Robotic Process Automation (RPA) - $450,000 
Software tools that mimic the mundane human tasks (i.e., eliminate double data entry and 
repetitive system tasks) to increase the speed and accuracy of data entry tasks between 
multiple systems within DHS and systems outside of DHS where programmatic or system-to-
system integrations are not possible.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) - $400,000 
 
DHS has invested in AI/ML technologies as a result of the pandemic and the sudden and sharp 
increases in demand for DHS benefits, increased number of new applications and clients, and 
the need to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of staff.  At the same time, the state 
suffered from a shortage of workers due to a statewide hiring freeze, defunding of vacant 
positions, and a dramatic number of retirements over the past 3 years.  The AI/ML technologies 
use natural language processing and intelligent searching to process and present data that is 
locked in the unstructured text, like case notes in mainframe applications or transcriptions for 
voice and chatbots tied to our cloud-based contact center to better serve DHS clients. 
Customer Service Technologies that provide more client self-service capabilities 24x7x365 - 
$400,000 
 
Cloud-based DHS-wide contact center/call center software services, constituent issue tracking 
system for consolidated reporting and seamless transfers between AI virtual voice agents and 
virtual chatbots, emails and "contact us" form DHS websites, internal case or eligibility staff, 
and external DHS partners where clients can get information that they want 24x7, the help they 
need during business hours without having to repeat their story or situation over and over if 
they are transferred from one person to another. 
IT Consulting Services - $300,000 
The IT consulting services needed in support of the DHS initiatives and investment areas are 
needed to ensure that these technologies are effectively implemented, managed, and 
maintained while DHS works to recruit and rebuild its IT workforce and provide sufficient 
training to existing and new staff.  DHS, like many other state agencies, has operated with 
legacy systems that are outdated, unsupported, and unable to be enhanced or modified 
effectively.  The legacy systems are costly to maintain, and the workforce with expertise in 
those systems has retired or will retire within the next 3-5 years.   
Data Management - $800,000 
DHS seeks to establish and implement a formalized Data Management program based on 
industry best practices and frameworks that include Data Governance, Data Integration, Data 
Sharing, Reporting, and Analytics capability.  During the pandemic, DHS established a technical 
solution and platform tool that enables DHS to integrate, transform, or orchestrate the 
movement of data from one system to another, from one format to another, or with any 
combination with a number of systems to build quick web interfaces leveraging the data, 
centrally storing master data records for reporting, and enabling secure sharing and hosting 
datasets in a data catalog.  However, DHS needs to continue investing in both technical and, 
more importantly, non-technology people, process, and organization practices to establish a 
formal data management and data governance program which will allow DHS to expand its data

sharing capabilities as the state moves toward closer collaboration and sharing of data between 
state and local agencies, and providing more transparency of government services through 
advanced reporting and analytics.   
IT Workforce Development & IT Innovation Projects - $50,000 
The department seeks to invest $20,000 in IT Workforce Development and $30,000 in IT 
Innovation Projects as a commitment to the ongoing IT Modernization and DHS Transformation 
initiatives.  This annual investment enables the transformation of the way DHS builds, buys, 
delivers, and shares technology using modern methodologies and technologies to assist the 
department in improving the public’s experience with DHS.  The department will focus 
investments to help make our IT services more accessible, efficient, and effective by building 
and providing technology applications, platforms, processes, training and certifications for staff, 
and supplemental software solutions.  DHS will continue to build the foundation for digital 
transformation with a focus on putting users first, building, sharing, and using open source 
code, public and private cloud, and platform technologies, and improving upon our existing 
shared services, enterprise platforms, and security.  
 
904AA-03: Add Funds for Family Resource Centers 
Act 129, SLH 2022, relating to Family Resource Centers (FRC), is a five-year pilot program within 
DHS.  This request is to fund one full-time equivalent (1.0) family resource center coordinator 
position to 1) further develop and implement a statewide network of school- and community-
based FRCs; 2) establish definitions, standards, and best practices; 3) identify and align available 
services, goals, and outcomes; and 4) develop referral and data tracking protocols. 
Family Resource Centers (FRCs) are safe, welcoming, and culturally appropriate spaces that 
support and strengthen families; utilize a multigenerational, strengths-based, and family-
centered approach; and provide concrete supports, activities, and programs designed to reflect 
and be responsive to the specific needs, cultures, and interests of the communities and 
populations served.   
According to the National Family Support Network (NFSN), FRCs play a critical role in preventing 
child abuse and neglect, strengthening children and families, connecting family-impacting 
agencies and programs, creating connections to resources and parent support systems, and 
increasing family engagement which all leads to greater student success in school.  The local 
statewide network is the Hawaii ‘Ohana Support Network (HOSN).  
Current resources:   
Act 129, SLH 2022, $300,000 Family Resource Center for FY 2022-2023, for a five (5) year pilot 
project.

Act 125, SLH 2022/Act 133, SLH 2023, $305,000 relating to incarcerated individuals for a child 
visiting and family resource center at Waiawa Correctional Facility.  Funds were encumbered: 
$274,500 ($305,000 minus 10% restriction). 
Expenditures in the prior year:  
Funds were appropriated through Act 125, SLH 2022/Act 133, SLH 2023 for a child visiting and 
family resource center at Waiawa Correctional Facility.  A vendor was procured in November 
2023 and awarded in January 2024.  The contract was executed in May 2024.  Of the $305,000 
appropriated funds, 10% was restricted under execution policies, and $274,500 was released 
and encumbered.  For FY24, family resource centers expended $219,950 out of the $270,000 
($300,000 minus 10% restriction) to develop HOSN, contract a vendor to establish the Waiawa 
Correctional Facility child visiting and family resource center, offer training, and purchase 
school furnishings to transform space into a family resource center.  The total expended was 
$494,450.  
Other relevant factors: 
The devastation from the Maui Wildfires and the continuing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic 
highlights the need for mental health services and opportunities to build social capital for both 
children and adults.  FRCs assist families by providing a safe and caring place, resources, and 
support to strengthen families, connect them to public benefit programs, address the lingering 
mental health issues of children and families, and provide family engagement for increased 
school readiness and academic success.  
Impact on program performance measures: 
The current target group size is statewide, and the current total of FRCs is eight (8) community-
based (aka Neighborhood Places), 13 school-based, and one (1) correctional facility.  Over the 
last two years, five (5) more school-based FRCs were started (only 5 in 2022), with three (3) 
others in the development stages (hiring staff and finding a space on campus).  One 
community-based organization launched a community-based FRC in October 2023, and a child 
visiting and family resource center started at Waiawa Correctional Facility in April 2024.   
Notably, a memorandum of understanding was signed in July 2024 among the Departments – 
of Education (DOE), Health (DOH), and Human Services (DHS), giving school principals the 
authority to create FRCs on their campuses in partnership with full support of the 
Superintendent and in partnership with DOH and DHS.  As a result, principals are finding that 
FRCs are the added support teachers need for family engagement and parent participation on 
campuses.  As an example, one school has several students who are raised by grandparents.  
Those grandparents formed a group and call themselves the "kupuna crew" and are on campus.  
They plan and execute Native Hawaiian activities with the students.  Many of the grandparents 
also attended the same school when they were in elementary school.  The presence of 
grandparents on campus changed the campus culture.  In addition, the FRC offers concrete 

Department of Human Services 
March 4, 2025 
Page 68 of 94 
 
AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY AGENCY 
 
supports of food, clothing, and household items through community partnerships.  The FRC is a 
gathering place to meet and engage with other families of varying cultures and ethnicities.  
Previously, one of the schools that now has an FRC had tension between ethnic groups.  Now, 
families bring things to share.  They give as well as take items they need.  
Families with children find it difficult to navigate and maneuver through state systems for 
public benefits and seek help to meet their specific needs of mental health, parenting 
education, and further learning opportunities for their children.  Some parents experience 
traumas from their own childhood school experience.  FRCs bridge the communication gap 
between families and school faculty and provide parents with training to help their children 
succeed in school by increasing family engagement, which helps to motivate students to 
become academically successful, reduce chronic absenteeism, and increase graduation rates. 
In addition, the fathers incarcerated at Waiawa Correctional Facility are eager to learn 
parenting skills and healthy relationships to reconnect with their children and caregivers.  The 
partnership with the newly created Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (DCR) 
(previously known as the Department of Public Safety) and DHS is working well, and inmates 
indicated that reconnection to their children is a great incentive to reduce recidivism. 
Accomplishments: 
The Implementation Plan resulted in the FRC network governance, definition of roles, 
operational guidelines, and membership agreement.  Also, the three departments (education, 
health, and human services) memorialized Act 129, SLH 2022, with a memorandum of 
understanding that was signed in July 2024.  In addition, training sessions are offered on the 
NSFN Standards of Quality for Family Strengthening & Support, and Parent Advisory Council 
(PAC).  Additionally, courses were offered to train the trainers on the 5 Protective Factors for 
family strengthening and parent leadership (as a precursor to PAC training). 
HOSN presented at numerous conferences, meetings, and collaboratives at the local and 
national forums, including informational sessions for potential school-based FRCs, national and 
congressional delegate briefings, continued collaborative work with the DOE Community School 
model for Title 1 schools with principals and coordinators, and special focus on Comprehensive 
Support and Improvement Schools, which are usually the schools with the lowest graduation 
rates.  HOSN continues to host meetings every other month with the larger community of FRCs 
and family strengthening organizations, Network Executive and Steering Committees meetings 
monthly, as well as individual school-based FRC coaching and monthly technical assistance for 
regional school-based FRCs.   
Procurement and selection of a vendor for the child visiting and family resource center at 
Waiawa Correctional Facility was completed, and the contract was executed in May 2024.  
Waiawa Correctional Facility, including the men incarcerated there, built the center and patio 
area and installed a playground with regulation foundation and padding.

The contracted vendor is building trusted relationships with fathers who are incarcerated.  It is 
conducting intake assessments with fathers and families and has started conducting parenting 
classes specifically for dads.  They are offering virtual healthy relationships courses for teens 
and complete pre- and post-visit sessions with children and moms/caregivers before in-person 
visitation with their dads.  The pre-and post-visit sessions are aimed at reducing anxiety and 
emotional or behavioral issues and provide tools and resources for coping with the emotions of 
a visit with a dad and easing the transition back to daily life with mom/caregiver.   
Alternatives: 
If the pilot project is not funded for additional years, then children, families, and communities 
will not have the essential space, training, and technical assistance to help families address 
their concerns about their child when concerns first arise.  Having a trusted person to turn to in 
a familiar location supports the child's, family's, and community's overall well-being so the child 
and family can thrive.  Pandemic rules and restrictions resurfaced a more profound need and 
inequities requiring healing from historical and cultural trauma that was not adequately 
addressed prior to the pandemic.  In particular, the schools with FRCs are seeing positive 
impacts on campuses and increased family engagement.  Discontinued funding of the five (5) 
year pilot project would disrupt these nurturing and safe space avenues to seek family 
strengthening and mental health alternatives for students, families, and even faculty, who 
often use or staff the FRCs. 
Other alternatives explored in the past, include the establishment of a navigator position(s) to 
help families with complex cases of multiple challenges and needs was suggested pre-
pandemic.  Vacant positions to set up this position were difficult to find or were defunded 
during the pandemic.  Social workers or case managers have been difficult to hire or keep due 
to non-competitive salaries or early burn-out.  For greater efficiency, state programs have 
moved from case management to task orientation to accommodate the increased volume and 
need for public assistance programs.  Lastly, the loosely formed group of state agencies and 
community organizations needed a way to establish FRCs at the state level.  Grassroots efforts 
are important, but determined FRCs needed more recognition, committed funding, and have 
standards or a framework embedded into state law. 
This request is to provide continued funding for the five-year Family Resource Center Pilot 
Program to establish a family support network and increase the number of family resource 
centers to serve the children, families, and communities in Hawaii.

904AA-04: Disaster Case Management Project - Rental Assistance Program 
DHS requires general fund appropriations to support the department's Maui wildfire 
emergency management and long-term recovery response, including the State's Disaster Case 
Management Program (DCMP).  This request includes approval and requests for appropriations 
for eight (8) temporary exempt administrative positions dedicated to the Maui response, 
operations, and IT support and funds to meet the needs of survivors, including those who may 
also be ineligible for FEMA or other federal disaster assistance.  Specifically, this request is to 
ensure the continuity of the assistance and programs led by DHS for the first three (3) years of 
the Maui wildfire disaster response and recovery efforts.   
 
Six (6) of the positions are specific to the DCMP, which is currently 100% funded by a FEMA 
grant for the first 24 months following the date of disaster.  FEMA funds are expected to be 
extended an additional 12 months—for a total of 36 months of 100% FEMA funding.  Thus, 
while FEMA will fund the first 36 months of the program, given the level of devastation from 
the disaster, it is expected that this program will be needed for five years to ensure successful 
recovery for survivors.   
 
The remaining two (2) positions that require 100% general funds are for the administrative 
(including responses to Uniform Information Practices Act requests and attendance at 
meetings) and operations functioning of the state’s Rental Assistance Program.  This request 
will ensure the Director's Office continues to have staff and resources dedicated to the 2023 
Maui wildfire relief efforts to lead an equitable recovery. 
 
Significantly, DHS is the State's lead agency for the State's DCMP that provides intensive 
disaster case management for all survivors of the Maui wildfires.  At Governor Green and 
HIEMA’s request, DHS was the State's applicant for the FEMA DCMP grant, which is initially 24 
months of performance with a possible single extension of 12 months.  Thus, FEMA funding 
cannot exceed 36 months.  DHS was initially awarded $17.2M by FEMA on November 8, 2023, 
for an initial performance period from August 10, 2023, through August 10, 2025.  During the 
first year, FEMA has provided additional funds.  To date, DHS has received a total of $25.15M 
from FEMA to ensure sufficient funds to serve approximately 3,000 households for the first 24 
months of this program.  Currently, the DCMP has served over 5,000 individuals and has active 
cases for over 3,800 survivors.  Given the documented high level of need for recovery, 
additional funding for years 4 and 5 of this program is required. 
 
To immediately implement the DCMP and other Maui Wildfire response and recovery efforts, 
DHS created a special project for six additional temporary exempt administrative positions in 
the Director's Office to oversee both the DCMP and all Maui recovery efforts.  This special 
project was expanded and includes additional positions, including (two) 2 additional positions 
for the DCMP.  The FEMA grant covers the salaries of all 6 DCMP positions, including the DCMP 
Director ($150,216), DCMP Administrator ($113,940), DCMP Financial Director ($120,576), 

Department of Human Services 
March 4, 2025

DCMP Administrative Assistant ($62,400), DCMP Screening, Eligibility, and Outreach Care 
Navigation Branch Program Manager ($76,788), and the DCMP Communications and Outreach 
Director ($109,992). 
 
The DCMP serves as a connection point for all other DHS wildfire response initiatives.  The 
DCMP includes seven Maui community-based organizations and up to 55 disaster case 
managers, as well as 20 Outreach Care Navigators, and all requisite support staff for a total 
program footprint of approximately 90 individuals.  The DCMP provides case management and 
navigation assistance for all Maui fire survivors and has the funding capacity to serve 
approximately 3,000 households—or nearly 8,000 individuals.   
 
Ultimately, DHS continues to strive to provide a program that is available for all fire survivors, 
regardless of FEMA eligibility, to assist in navigating recovery and identifying resources across 
all stakeholders to ensure all unmet needs of survivors that arose from the disaster are met.  
The consistency and continuity of this program are vital to support survivors' recovery, hence 
the importance of funding to ensure uninterrupted program operations. 
 
Now that we are in the second year of the program, we will soon apply for a 12-month 
extension of the FEMA grant.  However, given the magnitude of the disaster, we forecast the 
DCMP will be a three- to five-year effort. 
 
The Maui Emergency Response Director ($112,944) and Emergency Management Finance, 
Procurement, and Grants Manager ($109,308) will continue to coordinate the Rental Assistance 
Program and other DHS-led Maui response efforts that are not DCMP-specific.  Since the August 
8, 2023 wildfires, DHS has actively worked to address the immediate needs of individuals, 
families, and community providers.  DHS facilitated the state’s Emergency Support Function 
(ESF) 6 – Mass Care & Feeding, and at the direction of the Governor, DHS developed and 
launched the state’s Rental Assistance Program, in partnership with Airbnb, Global 
Empowerment Mission, and most recently with the Council for Native Hawaiian Advancement. 
 
Auditor VII: 
This position is necessary to provide audit reports to the Legislature and the Governor and to 
ensure that accounting, reporting, expenditures, contracts, procurement, and finances comply 
with laws, rules, regulations, and grant requirements.  Reporting includes but is not limited to, 
responding to Act 10, SLH 2024 
 
The Auditor VII position is essential to ensure the integrity and accountability of federal and 
state funds allocated for Maui wildfire recovery efforts and future disasters.  This role will play a 
critical function in safeguarding public resources and promoting transparency in government 
operations. 
 
This position will conduct audits of the department's financial, operational, and compliance 
activities.  Audit activities include assessing the effectiveness of internal controls, identifying 

Department of Human Services 
March 4, 2025

risks, and recommending improvements to ensure compliance.  Failure to comply with federal 
grant requirements can lead to a variety of penalties, ranging from financial penalties, such as 
cost disallowances, interest charges, or loss of future funding, to program termination. 
 
This position will prepare audit reports that clearly communicate audit findings, 
recommendations, and management responses.  This position will also support the training of 
fiscal and budget officers to ensure compliance with laws, rules, regulations, and grant 
requirements.  This position will further assist in plan formulation for implementing audit 
recommendations, including as it may relate to federal grant opportunities. 
 
The Auditor VII position is crucial for several reasons: 
• Accountability and Transparency: By conducting independent audits, this position will 
help ensure that public funds are used appropriately and for their intended purposes. 
• Risk Mitigation: Identifying and addressing risks associated with disaster recovery efforts 
will help protect public resources and improve the effectiveness of disaster response. 
• Compliance Assurance: Ensuring compliance with laws, regulations, and grant 
requirements will help avoid penalties and maintain eligibility for future funding. 
• Improved Efficiency: Auditor recommendations can help improve the efficiency and 
effectiveness of departmental operations. 
• Public Trust: This position will help maintain public trust in the government's ability to 
manage funds responsibly.

Explanation of KPI trending: 
KPI #1 (Employment and Economic Self-Sufficiency) - 
 
SFY 2024 – 08/06/24 
• There continues to be a demand for workforce so businesses may continue to offer 
competitive wages causing applicants to not qualify or recipients to exit TANF sooner.  
Furthermore, the State Minimum Wage increased from $12.00 to $14.00 per hour 
beginning January 1, 2024. 
 
SFY 2023 – 07/31/23 
• There continues to be a demand for workforce so businesses may continue to offer 
competitive wages causing applicants to not qualify or recipients to exit TANF.  The 
waiver for eligibility interviews for applicants ended post-pandemic. 
 
SFY 2022 – 08/15/22 
• With businesses operating close to pre-pandemic, families are obtaining employment.  
In addition, there are greater demand for workforce so businesses may be offering 
wages above minimum wage causing families to exit TANF. 
 
SFY 2021 - 7/27/21 
• The pandemic impacted the number of families who exited TANF with employment.  
With the shutdown, unemployed recipient families were not able to engage in job 
search activities, and employed families were either laid-off, furloughed, or scheduled 
work hours reduced. 
 
SFY 2020 - 7/24/20 
• [Pre-pandemic] Decrease in the number of FTW participants who exited TANF with 
employment was proportionate to the decrease in TANF caseload.  Fewer families 
needing TANF assistance may be the result of lower unemployment rates and greater 
workforce demand by employers.  Catherine Scardino, who is ETPO Program 
Administrator, also noticed families were not staying on assistance for long.  
Approximately 47% of families who received assistance in fiscal years 2018, 2019 or 
2020 (July 2019 – March 2020), utilized only 36 months or less of TANF benefits (limit is 
60 cumulative months in a family’s lifetime).  These reasons combined would cause a 
compounded effect on the TANF caseload to move downward aggressively.   
• Catherine thought the required upfront work program participation (aka Upfront 
Universal Engagement or UFUE) may also be a factor to the declining caseloads.  In 2009, 
TANF rules were amended to require applicants to fulfill one week of upfront work 
program participation, within a 21-day period, as a condition of eligibility for TANF 
benefits.  Participants were engaged in the FTW Program by the time their applications 
were approved.

• Between Federal Fiscal Years (FFY) 2014 and 2018, Hawaii’s TANF caseload steadily 
declined.  The average monthly TANF caseload in FFY 2018 was 4,593 recipient families, 
a decline of 45.8% when compared to the monthly average of 8,470 families in FFY 
2014.  As the result, the number of FTW participants declined proportionately (KPI #1 
and 3a).  The average TANF caseload for FFY 2019 was 4,330/month, about 5.7% decline 
compared to FFY 2018 at 4,593 families/month.  Number of people who received TANF 
benefits declined over the 3-year period due to an improvement in the economy.   
 
 
KPIs #2 and 2a (TANF Program) - 
 
SFY 2024 – 08/06/24 
• There continues to be a demand for workforce so businesses may continue to offer 
competitive wages causing applicants to not qualify or recipients to exit TANF sooner.  
Furthermore, the State Minimum Wage increased from $12.00 to $14.00 per hour 
beginning January 1, 2024. 
 
SFY 2023 – 07/31/23 
• There continues to be a demand for workforce so businesses may continue to offer 
competitive wages causing applicants to not qualify or recipients to exit TANF.  The 
waiver for eligibility interviews for applicants ended post-pandemic. 
 
SFY 2022 – 08/15/22 
• With the state and businesses operating close to pre-pandemic and families obtaining 
employment, less families are applying for TANF financial assistance, therefore, resulting 
in decreases to the number of applications and approvals.   
 
SFY 2021 – 10/26/21 
• The decreased number of applications and number of approvals from SFY 2020 to 2021 
can be attributed to the reopening of businesses, allowing families to go back to work. 
 
SFY 2020 – 10/26/21 
• The increased number of applications and number of approvals from SFY 2019 to 2020 
can be attributed to the COVD-19 pandemic. 
 
 
KPI #2b (TANF Program) - 
 
SFY 2024 – 08/06/24 
• There continues to be a demand for workforce so businesses may continue to offer 
competitive wages causing applicants to not qualify or recipients to exit TANF sooner.

Furthermore, the State Minimum Wage increased from $12.00 to $14.00 per hour 
beginning January 1, 2024. 
 
SFY 2023 – 07/31/23 
• The waiver for eligibility interviews for applicants ended post-pandemic which may be 
the reason for significant increase in denials for other reasons. 
 
SFY 2022 – 08/15/22 
• The decrease in denied applications due to income may correlate to the decline in the 
number of applications because not as many families require financial assistance when 
compared to the period when the pandemic was at its peak in 2021. 
 
SFY 2021 – 10/26/21 
• The number of denials due to income increased from SFY 2020 to 2021 as the result of 
families having income above the income threshold.  State reopening allowed families 
to go back to work. 
 
SFY 2020 – 10/26/21 
• The number of denials increased from SFY 2019 to 2020 can be attributed to the 
increased number of denials due to income which increased from 27.8% to 34.9% 
(change of 7.1%).  Applicant families may have other sources of income such as second 
adults still employed, countable unearned income (e.g., Social Security benefits, 
pension/retirement, worker’s comp/TDI benefits not considered earnings, etc.). 
 
 
KPI #2c (TANF Program) - 
 
SFY 2024 – 08/06/24 
• In addition to the reinstatement of the upfront work participation requirements, the 
decrease in caseload may provide staff more opportunity to work closely with recipient 
families. 
 
SFY 2023 – 07/31/23 
• The reinstatement of the upfront work participation requirements may have attributed 
to the increase in the work participation rates.  In addition, the decrease in caseload 
may provide staff more opportunity to work closely with recipient families. 
 
SFY 2022 – 08/15/22 
• During 2021 until June 2022, the upfront work participation requirements, as a 
condition of initial eligibility, were waived for all TANF applicants.  Pre-pandemic, the 
upfront work participation requirements were effective in preparing TANF applicants to 
fully engage in the FTW program by the time their applications were approved.  

Department of Human Services 
March 4, 2025

However, with the pandemic and waived requirements, participants were unable to 
engage in the FTW program.  Effective applications received from June 1, 2022 and 
forward, the upfront work participation requirements have been re-implemented for all 
TANF applicants.   
 
SFY 2021 – 10/26/21 
• Although the State reopened between SFY 2020 and 2021, FTW participants who were 
able to return to work did not stay long on assistance, causing the WPR to decrease. 
 
SFY 2020 – 10/26/21 
• The decreased WPR from FFY 2019 to 2020 can be attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic 
and state shutdown.  It limited the FTW participants’ ability to engage in work activities 
(e.g., job search, volunteering, attending classes in-person, etc.).  
 
 
KPI #3a (Employment Support Services) –  
 
SFY 2024 – 08/06/24 
• The decrease in the number of FTW participants receiving supportive services is 
reflective of the decreasing caseload. 
 
SFY 2023 – 07/31/23 
• The decrease in the number of FTW participants receiving support services is reflective 
of the decreasing caseload.  Note: The SFY 2022 total number of FTW participants who 
received support services that was previously reported was incorrect.   
 
SFY 2022 – 08/15/22 
• The number of FTW participants receiving support services decreased due to the 
decreasing FTW caseloads.  Furthermore, there are still some participants who are 
unable to fully engage in the FTW program, therefore, do not qualify for support 
services. 
 
SFY 2021 - 7/27/21 
• There were less participants receiving supportive service payments as the result of 
participants’ inability to engage in work activities during the pandemic.  To be eligible for 
supportive service payments, participants must be actively engaged in work activities. 
 
SFY 2020 - 7/24/20 
• The one-time rent support payments may have caused the significant increase from 
2019 to 2020.  The FTW Program provides up to two months of one-time rent support to 
FTW participants who need to secure housing or are at risk of eviction.  We were able to 
increase the one-time rent support from two to four months when the governor

suspended HRS §341-261 through his Sixth and subsequent Supplementary 
Proclamations. 
• An average of 21 FTW participants per month received one-time rent support between 
July 2019 and April 2020.  In the months of May and June, about 216 participants each 
month received rent support. 
 
SFY 2019 – 8/8/19 
• Between Federal Fiscal Years (FFY) 2014 and 2018, Hawaii’s TANF caseload steadily 
declined.  The average monthly TANF caseload in FFY 2018 was 4,593 recipient families, 
a decline of 45.8% when compared to the monthly average of 8,470 families in FFY 
2014.  As the result, the number of FTW participants declined proportionately (KPI #1 
and 3a).  The average TANF caseload for FFY 2019 was 4,330/month, about 5.7% decline 
compared to FFY 2018 at 4,593 families/month.  Number of people who received TANF 
benefits declined over the 3-year period due to an improvement in the economy.   
 
 
KPI #3b (Employment Support Services) –  
 
SFY 2024 – 08/06/24 
• The increase in the number of E&T participants receiving supportive services is reflective 
of the increase in referrals in anticipation of the waiver ending effective June 30, 2024. 
 
SFY 2023 – 11/6/23 
• Due to the ABAWD waiver, work participation requirements have been waived which 
has led to a decrease in participation. The current participation waiver is set to expire in 
June 2024, which will lead to an increase in participation in SFY 2025. 
 
SFY 2022 – 8/4/22 
• Overall trend continues to increase and return to pre-pandemic levels.  There has been 
an increase in transportation support services due to the increase in fuel prices.  
Education has also increased and could be attributed to the need for skills development. 
 
SFY 2021 - 7/27/21 
• Returning to pre-pandemic levels beginning the latter part of SFY2021. 
 
SFY 2020 - 7/24/20 
• There was an increase of clients until the last two months of SFY20 due to the pandemic.

• The decrease in the number of employed FTW participants and job retention figures are 
reflective of the decreasing TANF caseload.  
 
SFY 2023 – 07/31/23 
• The decrease in number of employed FTW participants and job retention figures in 
reflective of the decreasing TANF caseload. 
 
SFY 2022 – 08/15/22 
• There may be a correlation between the increased number of families exiting TANF due 
to employment and the decreased number of employment participants.  Although the 
number of participants retaining their employment longer than 90 days is significant, 
some of these employed participants may be exiting shortly after passing the 90-day 
mark. 
 
SFY 2021 - 7/27/21 
• There may be a correlation between the decreased number of FTW participants exiting 
TANF with employment and the increased number of employed participants retaining 
their employment for more than 90 days.  FTW participants may be retaining their 
employment, but they are not earning high enough wages to exit TANF or may still be 
underemployed (working less than full-time hours).   
 
SFY 2020 - 7/24/20 
• Decrease in the number of employed participants and the job retention figures are in 
line with the decreasing TANF caseload [pre-pandemic].   
 
SFY 2019 - 8/8/19 
• Between Federal Fiscal Years (FFY) 2014 and 2018, Hawaii’s TANF caseload steadily 
declined.  The average monthly TANF caseload in FFY 2018 was 4,593 recipient families, 
a decline of 45.8% when compared to the monthly average of 8,470 families in FFY 
2014.  As the result, the number of FTW participants declined proportionately (KPI #1 
and 3a).  The average TANF caseload for FFY 2019 was 4,330/month, about 5.7% decline 
compared to FFY 2018 at 4,593 families/month.  Number of people who received TANF 
benefits declined over the 3-year period due to an improvement in the economy.   
 
 
KPI #5 (Wage Progression) –  
 
SFY 2024 – 08/09/24 
• The decrease in the number of employed FTW participants is reflective of the 
decreasing TANF caseload.  The percentages of participants who experienced wage 
progression, no change, or a decrease in wages, are comparable to previous fiscal year.

SFY 2023 – 07/31/23 
• There was a small increase in the number of FTW participants who experienced a wage 
increase.  The demand for workforce and businesses offering competitive wages causing 
may be a factor to the wage increases. 
 
SFY 2022 – 08/15/22 
• The increased number of FTW participants that experienced a wage increase may be 
reflective of the higher workforce demand and businesses offering higher wages to 
recruit new employees and incentivize for them to remain employed. 
 
SFY 2021 - 7/27/21  
• The number of FTW participants who experienced no wage increase, increased from FY 
2020 to 2021.  This may be the result of participants gradually returning to the 
workforce, particularly those who were laid-off or furloughed.  In addition, with the 
economic downturn as the result of the pandemic, employers may have made it 
financially challenging to grant wage increases to employees.   
 
SFY 2020 - 7/24/20 
• Differences between 2019 to 2020 were not significant (1% - 3%). 
 
SFY 2019 - 8/8/19 
• Hawaii’s low unemployment rates and slower caseload decline may be factors to the 
number of employed FTW participants increasing from SFY 2018 and 2019.  The State’s 
minimum wage increase to $10.10/hour may have caused the percentage of 
participants who may have experienced increases in their wages to go up from SFY 2018 
to 2019 [KPI #5a].   
 
 
KPI #6 (Childhood Development and School Readiness) –  
 
SFY 2024 – 7/23/24 
• The decrease of 18% can be attributed to a decrease in enrollment for the 2023 – 2024 
program year as DHS conducted three (3) open application periods as opposed to five 
(5) open application periods the previous program year.  The program office did not 
have a permanent POD Specialist overseeing the program and the contracted staff could 
not support more open application periods due to vacancies.  Program office also 
worked on returning the contracted CCDF subsidy program back to DHS.  The contracted 
POD staff vacated their positions assuming all contracted subsidy services would return 
to DHS.  The POD program was left without a full-time operations manager and limited 
support staff and would not be able to process additional applications for the remaining 
year resulting in a decrease of eligible families.

SFY 2023 – 8/9/23 
• The increase in number of children being served in SFY 2023 is due to restored state 
funding and the department supporting extended application periods to eligible 
families.  The 32% increase meant more children experienced school readiness services 
that addressed their physical, cognitive, linguistic, social, and emotional development in 
the year prior to kindergarten. 
 
SFY 2022 – 8/4/22 
• Differences between 2021 to 2022 were not significant (1.3%).  POD matched the 
emergency child care rates offered by the federal Child Care Connection program and 
could not serve as many POD families which led to the department requesting 
additional funds to support existing POD families for the remaining two (2) months of 
the POD school year. 
 
SFY 2021 - 8/3/21 
• From Aug 2020 to June 2021, there was an average of 230 providers that served POD 
families.  While some schools remained open during the SFY 21, POD continued to make 
payment to POD providers that were still closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic so that 
the child had a spot when the provider decided to reopen.  The POD preschool pre-
assessment was not required by its usual due date since many staff and children did not 
return to the preschool in Jan 2021.  During the Covid-19 pandemic emergency, the 
Governor’s Emergency Proclamation suspended eligibility and other requirements for 
family units that were impacted by an emergency and allowed for re-determinations of 
eligibility and monthly payment amounts until 6/30/21. 
 
SFY 2020 - 7/14/20  
• Only about a half-percent change for SFY 2020 from SFY 2019, which is not a significant 
variance.   
It is noted that while only about 30% of regulated child care facilities and homes chose to 
remain open during the Governor’s stay-at-home orders, DHS did continue to assist families 
participating in the POD child care subsidy program and pay to hold the child’s seat at their 
usual preschool provider so that families had child care arrangements set when parents 
returned to their places of employment.   
 
SFY 2019 - 8/7/19  
• The decrease in number of children being served in SFY 2019 is due to the decrease in 
the number of applications the Preschool Open Doors program received, as DHS 
conducted only two open application periods for the SFY 2019 POD service year, as 
opposed to three open application periods conducted for SFY 2017 and SFY 2018 POD 
service years.  DHS received almost 1,000 fewer applications total for the SFY 2019 POD

service year, and less children were enrolled for POD services for SFY 2019.  The third 
application period usually would be in October, and in 2018, CCPO had a vacant 
position, staff were out, and a batch of contract renewal agreements were past due.  So, 
the program specialist overseeing POD had to assist and focus on the contract renewals 
in order for the contractors to get paid, including the contract for POD case 
management services.  If there were no contract funds to support the organization 
(which holds several contract services with DHS BESSD CCPO), the organization would 
not be able to continue services on their own and there would be no contract staff to 
assist families, receive applications, and process disposition on applications for a third 
application period.  The application periods for the POD service year are always ahead 
of the service year itself.  So, the application period for SFY 2019 was conducted during 
SFY 2018.  Because of the way the POD program operates, application 
periods/applications received are always referred to which POD year (SFY) they apply to 
regardless of when the application periods occurred.

KPI #8 (Child Health) - 
 
SFY 2024 – 7/3/24 
• Note: Med-QUEST and health plans have been working on increased outreach to 
providers and members on the new periodicity schedule.  As a result, the number of 
screenings has increased since the year before.  MQD expects this to continue to 
increase in future years. 
 
SFY 2023 – 8/31/23 
• Note: Med-QUEST (MQD) updated its Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and 
Treatment (EPSDT)/Well-Child periodicity schedule in January 2022 to align with 
national recommendations.  The reason the percentage is low in SFY23 compared to the 
previous years is because the national recommendation has changed to increase the 
total number of required screenings.  MQD is seeing more screenings than in prior 
years, but the increase in screenings has not caught up to the national 
recommendations.  The number of scr

• ings increased by nearly 5% this year compared to the previous year.  MQD is working 
with Health Plans to conduct outreach and education to members and providers on the 
increased number of necessary screenings for each age group and expects this KPI to 
increase as members and providers adjust to the new periodicity schedule.  
 
SFY 2022 – 8/12/2022 
• Note: The Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment (EPSDT) data for 2022 
is always a year behind.  This metric is the percentage of children receiving an EPSDT 
visit in 2021 that MQD will report to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) 
in 2022. 
 
SFY 2021 - 7/21/21 
• Note: The Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment (EPSDT) data for 2021 
is always a year behind.  This metric is the percentage of children receiving an EPSDT 
visit in 2020 that MQD will report to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) 
in 2021. 
 
SFY 2020 - 7/21/20 
• Note: The Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment (EPSDT) data for 2020 
is always a year behind.  This metric is the percentage of children receiving an EPSDT 
visit in 2019 that MQD reported to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in 
2020.  This aligns with the number they report to us each year.

KPI #9 (Child and Adult Safety) - The variance for both a and b are too small to justify so there is 
no explanation. 
 
 
KPI #10 (Housing Stability) – 
 
SFY 2024 – 8/9/24 
a. 6389 people experiencing homelessness according to the 2024 statewide Point in Time 
(PIT) Count Report. 
i. 
4494 on Oahu and 1895 on all neighbor islands.  
ii. 
An increase of 2.6% for Oahu from 2023 
iii. 
A decrease of 13.7% for all of neighbor island from 2023 
iv. 
An increase of 2.66% statewide from 2023 
b. The total number of individuals served decreased from 10,112 in State Fiscal Year 2023 
(SFY23) to 7,971 in State Fiscal Year 2024 (SFY24), marking a reduction of 21.17%. This 
decline is primarily due to enhanced diversion strategies that prevent individuals from 
entering the homelessness system, the implementation of targeted and intentional 
services, and a decrease in available shelter beds. 
c. The total number of individuals who exited to permanent housing rose from 4,125 in 
State Fiscal Year 2023 (SFY23) to 5,701 in State Fiscal Year 2024 (SFY24).  This increase 
can be attributed to several key factors, including significant efforts on the neighbor 
islands, where the permanent housing exit rate exceeded 34% compared to Oahu's 9%.  
Additionally, the implementation of targeted and intentional services, enhanced 
outreach and engagement strategies, and a growing recognition of the benefits of stable 
housing for overall health and well-being have all contributed to this positive trend. 
d. The FAC-K was relocated and reopened in Maili on 3/18/2024.  Between the FAC on 
Oahu and the other in Puna they served a total of 119 households compared to 40 the 
year before. 
e. The relocated FAC in Waianae officially reopened on March 18, 2024.  From July 1, 2023, 
to June 30, 2024, the new FAC achieved a perfect record by transitioning all 8 families it 
served into permanent housing.  The center maintained a 100% placement rate, with 
families moving into permanent housing within an average of 77 days, or just under 
three months. 
From July 1, 2023, to June 30, 2024, the FAC of Puna successfully transitioned 20 of 33 
families into permanent housing, achieving a 61% placement rate.  Families were moved 
into permanent housing in an average of 77 days, just under three months, which 
represents a 12-day improvement over the previous year’s average.

i. 
4,028 on Oahu and 2195 on all neighbor islands.  
ii. 
An increase of 4.18% from 2022 
i. PIT Count Report includes people in homeless shelters.  There was a 
significant decrease in people served in homeless shelter programs due to 
the COVID-19 pandemic.  Homeless Shelter Providers were challenged with 
implementing and complying with CDC guidelines, shortage in personnel, and 
implementing changes in administering services with the community in 
consideration for everyone’s health and safety.  
b. Number of individuals served by HPP, SHEG, Outreach, and shelters increased slightly 
despite the Providers continued challenges with implementing and complying with CDC 
guidelines, shortage in personnel, and implementing changes in administering services 
with the community in consideration for everyone’s health and safety. 
c. Number of individuals who exited to permanent housing from HPP, SHEG, Outreach, 
and shelters showed a significant increase of 1,600 individuals or 63.37% from the 
previous year despite the on-going challenges with the COVID-19 pandemic. Providers 
continued to face critical shortage of affordable housing in each county, on-going 
challenges with implementing and complying with CDC guidelines, shortage in 
personnel, and implementing changes in administering services with the community in 
consideration for everyone’s health and safety.  
d. Number of households served at Family Assessment Centers (FAC), Kakaako and Puna: 
i. 
The FAC in Kakaako (FAC-K) transitioned its last family in February 2022.  
ii. 
The emergency proclamation that supported FAC-K ended, and the City could no 
longer allow for the park facility to be used as a homeless shelter. The City was 
working with DHS-HPO to identify another location to continue FAC-K services, 
however no location was identified.  
iii. 
In SFY20, HPO was able to add another FAC in Puna (FAC-P), Hawaii through Act 
209, SLH 2018. In its first year, FAC-P served 37 households. The FAC-P has 9 
units and is projected to serve approximately 32 households each year. The FAC-
P implemented and complied with CDC guidelines to ensure the health and 
safety of participants and FAC-P staff. 
iv. 
In SFY21, the total number of households served by the FAC-P was 47 which was 
an increase of 10 or 27.03% compared to the year before. This increase was 
possible even during the COVID-19 pandemic due to having individual units 
instead of a congregate setting. Households were safe in their own units and 
practiced social distancing while in common areas.  
v. 
In SFY22, the total number of households served by the FAC-P was 33 which was 
a decrease of 14 or 29.79% when compared to the year before but still exceeded

contract projections by one household. This decrease compared to the year 
before was due to on-going challenges with the COVID-19 pandemic such as less 
households seeking services, a critical shortage of affordable housing while the 
public demand remains consistently high, and limited staffing capacity 
experienced by the service provider. 
vi. 
In SFY23, the total number of households served by the FAC-P was 40 which was 
an increase of 7 or 21.21% when compared to the year.  
 
SFY 2022 – 8/9/22 
a. 5973 people experiencing homelessness according to the 2022 statewide Point in Time 
(PIT) Count Report. 
i. 
3,951 on Oahu and 2,022 on all neighbor islands.  
ii. 
A decrease of 20.37% from 2020 (there was no PIT Count in 2021). 
i. PIT Count Report includes people in homeless shelters.  There was a 
significant decrease in people served in homeless shelter programs due to 
the COVID-19 pandemic.  Homeless Shelter Providers were challenged with 
implementing and complying with CDC guidelines, shortage in personnel, and 
implementing changes in administering services with the community in 
consideration for everyone’s health and safety.  
b. Number of individuals served by HPP, SHEG, Outreach, and shelters remained the same 
as 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Providers continue to face challenges with 
implementing and complying with CDC guidelines, shortage in personnel, and 
implementing changes in administering services with the community in consideration 
for everyone’s health and safety. 
c. Number of individuals who exited to permanent housing from HPP, SHEG, Outreach, 
and shelters slowed and showed another decrease of 736 individuals or 22.56% 
decrease from the previous year due to the on-going challenges with the COVID-19 
pandemic.  Providers face critical shortage of affordable housing in each county, on-
going challenges with implementing and complying with CDC guidelines, shortage in 
personnel, and implementing changes in administering services with the community in 
consideration for everyone’s health and safety.  These challenges resulted in less 
individuals exiting to permanent housing. 
d. Number of households served at Family Assessment Centers (FAC), Kakaako and Puna: 
i. 
Number of households served by the FAC in Kakaako (FAC-K) showed a decrease 
of 9 or 34.62% less than the year before due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 
FAC-K has a maximum capacity of 15 households or 50 individuals. The FAC-K 
continued to comply with CDC guidelines which reduce capacity by half, serving 

Department of Human Services 
March 4, 2025 
Page 91 of 94 
 
AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY AGENCY 
 
up to 8 households at any point in time, which resulted in less households served 
during the year. 
i. In addition to the challenges described above, the FAC Kakaako stopped 
taking new households in December 2021 in preparation to close in February 
2022. The emergency proclamation that supported FAC-K ended, and the City 
could no longer allow for the park facility to be used as a homeless shelter. 
The City is working with DHS-HPO to identify another location to continue 
FAC-K services. 
ii. 
In SFY20, HPO was able to add another FAC in Puna (FAC-P), Hawaii through Act 
209, SLH 2018. In its first year, FAC-P served 37 households.  The FAC-P has 9 
units and is projected to serve approximately 32 households each year.  The FAC-
P implemented and complied with CDC guidelines to ensure the health and 
safety of participants and FAC-P staff. 
iii. 
In SFY21, the total number of households served by the FAC-P was 47 which was 
an increase of 10 or 27.03% compared to the year before.  This increase was 
possible even during the COVID-19 pandemic due to having individual units 
instead of a congregate setting.  Households were safe in their own units and 
practiced social distancing while in common areas.  
iv. 
In SFY22, the total number of households served by the FAC-P was 33 which was 
a decrease of 14 or 29.79% when compared to the year before but still exceeded 
contract projections by one household.  This decrease compared to the year 
before was due to on-going challenges with the COVID-19 pandemic such as less 
households seeking services, a critical shortage of affordable housing while the 
public demand remains consistently high, and limited staffing capacity 
experienced by the service provider. 
e. Percentage of households at the Family Assessment Centers (FAC), Kakaako and Puna 
who were successfully housed in permanent housing: 
i. 
The total number of households who exited to permanent housing from the FAC-
K was 13 out of 17 or 76.47% of the households who exited during the year. 
Although an 85.71% increase from the year before, the FAC-K was challenged 
with the COVID-19 pandemic, shortage in personnel and staffing patterns, and a 
critical shortage of affordable housing while the public demand remains 
consistently high. 
ii. 
In SFY20, HPO was able to add another FAC in Puna (FAC-P), Hawaii through Act 
209, SLH 2018.  In its first year, FAC-P housed 15 out of 30 or 50% of the 
households who exited the FAC-P.  
iii. 
In SFY21, the total number of households who exited to permanent housing from 
the FAC-P was 19 out of 39 or 48.72% of the households who exited during the 
year which is comparable to the year before.

iv. 
In SFY22, the total number of households who exited to permanent housing from 
the FAC-P was 5 out of 26 or 19.23%, a significant decrease from the two prior 
years.  As the COVID-19 pandemic persists, the more difficult it is to overcome 
challenges such as shortages of affordable housing and shortages in personnel 
and staffing patterns. 
 
SFY 2021 - 8/4/21 
a. In 2021, no unsheltered count was conducted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
i. 
The 2021 sheltered count showed an overall decrease of 318 fewer people in 
shelter compared to the prior year.  
ii. 
Decreases were primarily due to shelters reducing their capacity served by 
implementing and complying with CDC guidelines to reduce the transmission of 
COVID-19. 
b. Number of individuals served by HPP, SHEG, Outreach, and shelters showed a decrease 
of 2,561 or 19.2% less than the year before due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Providers 
are challenged with implementing and complying with CDC guidelines, shortage in 
personnel, and implementing changes in administering services with the community in 
consideration for everyone’s health and safety. Overall, less individuals reached out and 
engaged in a variety of services.  
c. Number of individuals who exited to permanent housing from HPP, SHEG, Outreach, 
and shelters showed a decrease of 1,702 individuals or 34.2% less than the year before 
due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Less households reached out and engaged in services, 
resulting in less individuals exiting to permanent housing. 
d. Number of households served by the FAC showed a decrease of 19 or 42.2% less than 
the year before due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  The FAC has a maximum capacity of 15 
households or 50 individuals.  To implement and comply with CDC guidelines the FAC 
needed to reduce capacity by half, serving up to 8 households at any point in time, 
which resulted in less households served during the year. 
e. The total number of households who exited to permanent housing from the FAC 
showed a decrease of 10 households or 58.8% less than the year before due to the 
COVID-19 pandemic.  Besides a decrease in households seeking services, the Provider 
was challenged with implementing and complying with CDC guidelines, shortage in 
personnel and staffing patterns, and implementing changes in administering services 
with the community in consideration for everyone’s health and safety.

a. Transitional housing (TH) is considered temporary housing (not permanent) and is 
not included in the count. 
2. Challenges throughout the fiscal year included lack of affordable housing inventory, 
unemployment, poverty, limited services for mental illness and substance abuse which 
were exacerbated with the current COVID-19 pandemic that started to affect Hawaii 
from March 2020.  
3. Other challenges Providers experienced over the last year includes: 
a. Implementation of the Coordinated Entry System (CES) by both Partners in Care 
(PIC) and Bridging the Gap (BTG).  CES makes referrals to housing resources such as 
Transitional Shelter, RRH, and PSH. Both CoCs working to improve efficiency of CES 
to meet the needs of the homeless population and homeless service providers.  
b. Reduced number of Transitional Shelter units.  
c. Reduced number of homeless households served due to COVID-19 pandemic. 
d. Reduced number of permanent housing units available due to COVID-19 pandemic.    
 
SFY 2019 - 8/13/19

a. Transitional housing (TH) is considered temporary housing (not permanent) and is 
not included in the count. 
2. Challenges include lack of affordable housing inventory, unemployment, poverty, 
limited services for mental illness and substance abuse. 
3. Other challenges Provider experienced over the last three years included: 
a. Staff turnover and changes, 
b. Provider expansion; Provider started two new contracted services which strained 
their resources, 
c. Training resources and opportunities were limited, 
d. Loss of flexible funding and support services, 
e. Poor internet connectivity at facility (FAC). 
 
 
KPI #11 (Food Access) – 
 
SFY 2024 – 8/22/24 
• As the State continues to define the new normal, residents continue to remain 
employed and ineligible for SNAP.  Staffing shortages remain a key factor in our 
timeliness rate.  Our highest rate was at 88.0% in February 2024; our lowest rate was in 
July 2024 at 78.0%.  Annual average was at 83.5%. 
 
SFY 2023 – 11/6/23 
• As the State finds a new normal, residents continue to remain employed and ineligible 
for SNAP.  Staffing shortages remain a key factor in our timeliness rate.  Our highest rate

was at 83.4% in October 2022; our lowest rate was in June 2023 at 73.0%.  Annual 
average was at 78.1%. 
 
SFY 2022 – 8/4/22 
• As situation starts to go back to normal after the expiration of the State’s public health 
emergency in March 2022, most households can find jobs and made them ineligible for 
SNAP benefits.  Others chose not to continue participation in the program.  Less staffing 
and issues with the telephone system (contacting clients and processing centers) 
contributed to backlog in case processing and decrease in application processing 
timeliness rate. The decrease in the timeliness rate started in September 2021, the 
lowest in February 2022.  June 2021 timeliness rate shows a big improvement- 89.5%. 
 
SFY 2021 - 8/5/21 
• Due to the pandemic, there were an increase of individuals who received SNAP benefits 
and a decrease in percentage of SNAP applications processed in a timely manner. 
 
SFY 2020 - 7/16/20 
• First eight months of SFY20 continued the slight declining trend from last year.  Then 
pandemic struck. 
SFY 2019 - 8/8/19 
• Number of individuals receiving Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) 
benefits declined over the past 3 years largely due to the economy. 
• Percentage of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) applications 
processed in a timely manner (stable for the last 3 years).

In Support of 
HB 300 
 
RELATING TO THE STATE BUDGET. 
 
 
Chair Yamashita, Vice Chair Takenouchi, and Members of the Committee, the 
Hawai‘i State Energy Office (HSEO) strongly supports HB300, which appropriates funds 
for the operating and capital improvement budget of the Executive Branch for fiscal years 
2025-2026 and 2026-2027. 
  
We respectfully seek your support of HSEO’s BED120’s budget requests to ensure 
HSEO is appropriately staffed and funded to carry out the State’s top priorities on the 
critical path to a secure, resilient, clean energy economy. 
The first request will appropriately fund the position of the Chief Energy Officer, 
established by the Legislature under Act 122, SLH 2019.  Additional funds are needed to 
cover a payroll shortfall from the salary amount currently provided for the position that 
places the agency’s statutory head among the lower half of paid positions in the agency. 
The requested salary adjustment will realign the budget with actual costs and allow the 
program to utilize OCE funds now covering the shortfall to support critical operational 
expenses.   
The second request is an increase in payroll for the salaries of six mission critical 
positions in the HSEO program to a market standard level.  Since January of 2023, 
HSEO secured approximately $102 million in federal grants that fund mission critical

programs and added 11 new federally funded positions to carry out the State’s energy 
strategy.  This expansion of programmatic activity to accelerate the energy transition 
has resulted in an increase in workload for the general funded positions specified in our 
budget request who provide oversight and support to the federally funded positions and 
programs.  These subject matter experts consistently perform above expectation, take 
on more responsibilities, and contribute to a well-coordinated agency effort that 
exponentially leverages the federal funds. 
HSEO respectfully requests your favorable consideration of these requests. 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify.

Chair Yamashita, Vice Chair Takenouchi, and members of the Committee: 
 
The Department of Law Enforcement (DLE) strongly supports House Bill 300, which 
appropriates funds for the operating and capital improvement budget of the Executive 
Branch for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027. 
 
As a relatively new department with growing responsibilities, adequate funding is critical 
to DLE's mission of providing comprehensive law enforcement services throughout the 
state. The DLE acknowledges the importance of sound fiscal planning in supporting our 
operational needs, including staffing, equipment, facilities, and training. Proper budget 
allocation enables us to fulfill our expanding jurisdictional responsibilities at airports, 
harbors, state facilities, and in support of county law enforcement agencies. The 
appropriations contained in this budget are essential for maintaining public safety and 
security across Hawaii.

The DLIR strongly supports HB 300, which includes the following budget requests 
critical to our department: 
 
• $2.9+ million to fund the maintenance and operation of the Disability 
Compensation Division’s (DCD) Electronic Case Management System, including 
associated licenses and cloud services. The funding provides the means for 
injured workers, employers, attorneys, and physicians to electronically file and 
access workers’ compensation and temporary disability cases in a secured cloud 
environment. To date, there’s been $16.7M invested in the project and without 
funding the Division would need to reinstitute paper-based claims and shut down 
the public portal.  
 
• $126,000 for two Human Resources Specialist IV positions to implement the 
Holo delegation and Act 186 hiring programs. The DLIR currently has 73 
designated classes of work delegated by DHRD, these two positions will facilitate 
implementing Act 186 and facilitate participation in Holo delegation.  
 
• Two Labor Law Enforcement Specialist positions to address the backlog of labor 
law complaints investigated by the Wage Standards Division.

In Support 
House Bill No. 300, RELATING TO THE STATE BUDGET 
 
 
Aloha Chair Yamashita, Vice Chair Takenouchi, and Members of the House Committee on 
Finance:  
 
The Statewide Oﬃce on Homelessness and Housing Solutions (SOHHS) supports H.B. 300, 
Relating to the State Budget. We respectfully ask for your favorable consideration of the 
Executive Biennium Budget. 
 
H.B. 300 will allow SOHHS to continue the implementation of Kauhale initiatives across the 
state.  Currently, we have 18 Kauhale active across the state and have a goal to establish 30 
kauhale villages by the end of 2026. This was made possible by the generous support of the 
Hawaiʻi State Legislature which appropriated $33 million for FY25 for kauhale initiatives.  
These projects directly support and house residents experiencing or at risk of homelessness. 
The request for $50 million in the Executive Biennium Budget will develop new Kauhale 
programs and maintain operations including critical wrap around services for our unsheltered 
neighbors statewide who. 
 
As the Governor’s Coordinator on Homelessness, I am honored to further the important work 
of this oﬃce and the administration for the state. In 2024, the Green Administration set out 
with an ambitious goal of housing and sheltering half of our unsheltered homeless population 
by the end of 2026. I am conﬁdent that with this request, SOHHS will further expand deeply 
aﬀordable housing inventory and supportive services for individuals experiencing homelessness 
through the state’s Kauhale Initiative.  
 
Currently, we have 18 Kauhale active across the state and have a goal to establish 30 kauhale 
villages by the end of 2026. This was all made possible by the generous support of the Hawaiʻi 
State Legislature which appropriated $33 million for FY25 for kauhale initiatives.  
More than just temporary shelter, Kauhale is a unique and innovative approach that strives to 
demonstrate a new, cost-effective model that centers housing as a critical component of 
healthcare. Our Kauhale communities pair personal spaces with shared living spaces, often

envisioned as tiny homes communities or repurposed commercial, hotel, or apartment 
buildings, that respond to the unique needs of subpopulations experiencing homelessness. The 
model is built on the foundation of fostering community and responsibility among residents. 
Residents of Kauhale are provided access to robust wrap around services, including case 
management and medical care to build healthy and resilient communities that help people stay 
successfully housed long-term. This is what makes Hawaii and our kauhale initiatives different 
and unique. 
 
SOHHS appreciates your consideration of our request to further our eﬀorts to reduce and 
prevent homelessness across the state. Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony in 
strong support on this measure.

HB 300 - RELATING TO THE STATE BUDGET  
LNR404, SEQ # 104-001 
 
Honorable Chair Yamashita; Vice-Chair Takenouchi, and committee members, 
The enhancements to Hawaiʻi’s climate and hydrologic monitoring capacity proposed in this bill will 
greatly assist us in fulfilling our mission as stewards and stakeholders associated with managing 
water and environmental resources effectively.  Therefore, the County of Hawaii, Department of Water 
Supply (DWS) strongly supports HB 300, LNR404, SEQ #104-001.  
 
Reliable, real-time weather data is essential for managing Hawaiʻi Island’s vast and diverse water 
systems. The Hawaiʻi County Department of Water Supply (DWS) depends on accurate climate 
monitoring to address the island’s highly variable rainfall, prolonged droughts, and extreme weather 
events. The Hawai‘i Mesonet provides the detailed environmental data necessary to safeguard our 
water supply, support conservation efforts, and strengthen infrastructure resilience. 
The Hawaiʻi Mesonet is critical to DWS operations, providing data that helps: 
• 
Enhance Water Conservation & Supply Management – Real-time rainfall and soil moisture 
data improve groundwater recharge assessments, ensuring responsible aquifer use and 
reducing unnecessary pumping. 
• 
Improve Drought Preparedness – Long-term precipitation and temperature trends inform 
adaptive water management strategies, helping DWS anticipate shortages and allocate 
resources effectively. 
• 
Support Infrastructure Resilience – Temperature and soil moisture data help identify areas 
where aging pipelines are at greater risk of leaks or breaks, allowing for targeted maintenance 
and upgrades. 
• 
Manage Wildfire Risk – Many of DWS’s sources and infrastructure are in fire-prone areas. 
Mesonet stations track wind, temperature, and humidity conditions, aiding in wildfire risk 
mitigation and emergency planning. 
 
With 27 Mesonet stations already operating on Hawaiʻi Island, this network has proven invaluable in 
monitoring changing weather patterns and protecting our water supply. Continued investment in the 
Hawaiʻi Mesonet will ensure that DWS has the data needed to plan for future challenges, maintain 
critical infrastructure, and safeguard water resources for generations to come.

SUPPORT OF HB300, RELATING TO THE STATE BUDGET 
 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify in SUPPORT of this important measure. The Act 
Appropriates funds for the operating and capital improvement budget of the Executive Branch 
for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027. 
 
The County of Maui, Department of Water Supply is in full support of the CWRM Budget 
FY2025-2027. It is essential to Hawai‘i’s comprehensive hydrological monitoring network and 
therefore critical to characterizing the consequences of climate change on water availability, 
while supporting the regulation and management of Hawai‘i’s water resources. These are critical 
in advancing additional water resources and adding reliability to the Department’s growing 
needs.  
 
The additional housing that is needed is directly affected by the decisions made by CWRM. 
Their ability to make these critical decisions are based on a budget that supports extensive water 
resource management.  
 
Mahalo for your consideration.

‭Dear Committee on Finance,                                     Testimony pertaining to HB 300‬
‭In Support: On behalf of ABC Group Hawaii (Autism Behavior‬
‭Consulting Group, Inc) serving individuals with autism in Hawaii,‬
‭we ask that you approve the funds allocated for rates to maintain as‬
‭part of the Governer’s budget.  Please approve funding in SB300,‬
‭which appropriates funds to make the temporary reimbursement‬
‭rates for ABA service providers PERMANENT.‬
‭Thank you for your consideration,‬
‭Rep. Kyle T. Yamashita, Chair‬
‭Rep. Jenna Takenouchi, Vice Chair‬
‭Ensuring an adequate provider network is established by offering appropriate rates‬
‭that are reflective of the costs of living, and reimbursement rate increases over time is‬
‭critical. The MedQuest Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) reimbursement rates in‬
‭Hawaii have experienced capitation for more than a decade: and those rates having‬
‭been set in 2015 after the passage of ABA Legislation. We should be reminded that‬
‭these rates selected in 2015 were set BASED ON 2002-2004 the publicly available‬
‭TRICARE rates from that time period.‬‭The rates we operate on today are not‬
‭dissimilar to those we accepted from TRICARE in 2004.  21 years later,‬
‭reimbursement rates remain generally unchanged, and not reflective of cost of living‬
‭increases or wage increases for technician level providers.‬
‭Capitation of rates, and increased costs of living >70% for Oahu alone since 2004 (US‬
‭Bureau of Labor Statistics), make it impossible to sustain the provision of high quality,‬
‭clinic based medically-necessary Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) treatment‬

‭2‬
‭programs for young children impacted by autism. Since 2015, wages have increased in‬
‭Hawaii over 30%, forcing providers like us to make difficult decisions without having‬
‭reimbursement rate increase as a reflection of the economic conditions or cost of‬
‭living increases in Hawaii.‬
‭The provider shortage is real, and we are tasked with training up providers who leave‬
‭soon after hire, for rates that are near double, within the Department of Education‬
‭(DOE) educational systems. Our long waitlist continues to grow, and the staffing‬
‭barriers have restricted our ability to reduce the length of our waitlist to change the‬
‭lives of Hawaii’s children diagnosed with autism. Our waitlist at ABC today consists of‬
‭60% MedQuest children who need intensive ABA treatment and are unable to access‬
‭that care in a timely manner, per Medicaid standards. This has caused us and other‬
‭providers to maintain long wait lists (some several years long!) for children who are in‬
‭dire need of services and appears to be in direct opposition to the requirements of‬
‭EPSDT and Medicaid.‬
‭The existing MedQUEST rates were increased‬‭TEMPORARILY‬‭for 2025 to reflect‬
‭the increased cost of providing services, per the Milliman Study conducted and the‬
‭Legislature adopted at the lowest reimbursement recommendation level.‬
‭As indicated below, other states with similar costs of living have‬‭PERMANENT‬
‭rates (orange) more in line with economic forces and cost of living. Further, recent‬
‭CMS guidance from SHO 24-0005 was consistent with these concerns: “Although‬
‭adequate provider rates are not, in and of themselves, enough to ensure a sufficient‬
‭network, without them, any steps a state might take to improve the provider‬
‭workforce likely will be less effective.”‬

‭3‬
‭According to the most recent estimates from the Centers for Disease Control, 1 in‬
‭every 36 children are diagnosed with Autism.  This indicates that more than 2.78% of‬
‭Hawaii’s children on Medicaid have Autism . MANY of these young children are‬
‭unable to access the most basic, evidence-based, medically-necessary treatments to‬
‭ameliorate symptoms of their diagnosis and in some cases, change the trajectory of‬
‭their lives.‬
‭We greatly appreciate the efforts taken in 2024 to include funding for increased rates‬
‭for MEDQUEST funded ABA treatment. These funds were nonrecurring, only‬
‭providing an increase for 2025, therefore it is imperative we pass additional legislation‬
‭in the 2025 session to maintain these rates beyond 2025.‬
‭On behalf of ABC Group Hawaii (Autism Behavior Consulting Group, Inc) serving‬
‭individuals with autism in Hawaii, we ask that you approve the funds allocated for‬
‭rates to maintain as part of the Governer’s budget.  Please approve funding in SB300,‬
‭which appropriates funds to make the temporary reimbursement rates for ABA‬
‭service providers PERMANENT.‬
‭Thank you for your efforts to ensure all MedQUEST beneficiaries, including children‬
‭with autism, have access to the life-changing, evidence-based care called ABA.‬

Dear Chair Yamashita, Vice Chair Takenouchi, and Members of the Committee on Finance, 
I represent Responsive Caregivers of Hawaii, a nonprofit organization supporting individuals with 
Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (I/DD) through the Medicaid 1915(c) Home and Community-
Based Services (HCBS) Waiver, administered by the Department of Health’s Developmental Disabilities 
Division. 
We strongly support the following budget item in HB 300, scheduled for hearing on March 5, 2025 at 
9:00AM HTH 501 – Developmental Disabilities,) Page 24-25, Item NO. 18. 
  
HTH 501 includes the addition of $10,100,000 for FY 26 and $21,400,000 FY 27 to increase urgently 
needed services through the Medicaid 1915(c) Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) Waiver for 
Individuals  with I/DD and their families.  
Why This Funding is Critical 
• 
Severe Workforce Shortage: Providers cannot offer competitive wages to Direct Support 
Professionals (DSPs), leading to a crisis in care. 
• 
Inadequate Reimbursement Rates: Rates have not kept pace with rising costs, putting services 
at risk. 
• 
Rate Study Findings: After the 2026 minimum wage increase, service costs will be 24% higher 
than current reimbursement rates. Federal Medicaid requires sufficient rates to ensure access to 
care. 
• 
Access & Equity: Funding supports workforce development, improves access on neighbor 
islands, expands employment opportunities, and increases residential options. 
• 
Preventing Service Cuts: Without funding, providers may reduce services or serve fewer 
individuals, leaving families without support. 
• 
Avoiding Institutionalization: Families should not have to choose between placing a loved one 
in a facility or leaving the workforce to provide care. 
• 
Cost-Saving Measure: HCBS services save the state $77,000 per person annually compared to 
institutional care. Medicaid Waiver funding also brings a $0.48 federal match per state dollar 
invested, saving taxpayers $300 million annually. 
 
This funding is essential to keeping families together, preventing unnecessary institutionalization, and 
ensuring individuals with I/DD receive the support they need to live independently. 
Hawai‘i’s I/DD HCBS Waiver program serves 3,000 of our most vulnerable individuals each year, 
supported by 1,900 DSPs who help them fully participate in the community. 
Mahalo for your time and consideration, and for the opportunity to testify in support of HB 300 
HTH 501.

HB300– Appropriates funds to increase the funding for applied behavioral 
analysis services for persons with autism.  
 
Representative Kyle Yamashita, Chair, Representative Jenna Takenouchi, Vice 
Chair, and Members of the Committee 
 
Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony supporting HB300, which 
seeks appropriate funding for the Med-Quest Division to address non-covered or 
under-covered behavioral health services for Med-Quest beneficiaries. 
 
I am the President of Behavior Analysis No Ka Oi, Inc., a Kaka’ako-based clinic 
that has been providing services to individuals with autism for over 15 years. Our 
clinic specializes in applied behavior analysis (ABA), an empirically validated, 
medically necessary treatment for children diagnosed with autism and related 
disorders. While the passing of Luke’s Law in 2015 was a significant milestone, 
requiring health insurance coverage for autism diagnosis and treatment, the 
Medicaid fee schedule for ABA services has remained unchanged. 
 
Over the past decade, operational costs have risen significantly. Expenses related 
to rent, employee health insurance and benefits, and mileage reimbursements for 
employees commuting to homes and community sites have all increased. Despite 
these rising costs, the lack of increases to the Medicaid fee schedule has severely 
impacted our ability to recruit and retain qualified providers. 
 
We cannot offer competitive wages compared to school-based services, which are 
reimbursed at higher rates. This has led to challenges in hiring the best providers 
and retaining experienced staff. Many of our qualified professionals have 
relocated to the mainland, where the cost of living is lower, and fee schedules are 
more favorable, or leave the field completely. As a result, our clinic now has a 
waitlist of approximately three years for services. While the passage of Luke’s 
Law was a monumental advancement in securing services for the people of 
Hawai’i, it is not impactful if those it was meant to serve cannot find providers.  

2 
 
In conclusion, additional funding for the Med-Quest Division is essential to 
address the gap in non-covered or under-covered behavioral health services. This 
funding will ensure that medically necessary ABA services are accessible to 
individuals with autism in Hawai’i and help clinics like ours recruit and retain 
qualified providers to meet the growing demand for services.

Comments:  
I am writing as the President of the board of directors at Pakolea Support Services, a non profit 
ABA company on Kauai serving children with autism.  There is a huge need for ABA services 
for kids with autism and our company has struggled the past 4 years to hire and retain sufficient 
service providers leaving a wait lists of 2 years or more before children can receive needed 
support.  The QUEST reimbursement rates have remained stagnant and inflation has resulted in 
our inability to pay livable wages.  As a result, we have seen a significant reduction in our work 
force since 2021. 
Over 80% of the clients we serve get their medical insurance through QUEST.  Please keep the 
funds allocated for QUEST ABA services in the budget.  I would strongly support making the 
QUEST ABA rates permanent as this has the potential to greatly expand the ABA service field in 
Hawaii.  
On behalf of children with autism and their families, I ask that we give them the support and care 
they deserve, now and into the future. 
With aloha,

Re:   
Support for HB 300, Relating to the State Budget

The Hawai‘i Oral Health Coalition, a program of the Hawai‘i Public Health Institute1, is in support of HB 
300, which appropriates funds for the operating and capital improvement budget of the Executive Branch 
for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027.  
 
The mission of the Hawai‘i Oral Health Coalition (HOHC) is to improve the overall health and well-being 
of all Hawai‘i residents by improving access and equity in oral health care through collaborative 
partnerships, advocacy, and education. HOHC is a community-driven organization comprised of members 
representing organizations and individuals from diverse sectors across Hawai‘i.  
 
Oral health is essential to the overall physical, psychological, social, and economic well-being of Hawai‘i’s 
residents. Yet, our residents suffer from poor oral health:  
• 
Hawai‘i has among the highest prevalence of dental decay in children and adults compared to 
other states.  
• 
Low-income families, intellectually and developmentally disabled residents, kūpuna, Native 
Hawaiian and Pacific Islander populations, and neighbor island residents are disproportionately 
impacted by poor oral health. 
• 
Lack of an in-state dental school, geographic isolation, lack of community water fluoridation, and 
societal inequities are significant contributors to our poor oral health status. 
 
Forty-two states maintain dedicated public dental health staff responsible for assessing and monitoring 
the population’s oral health status, community needs, and infrastructure; informing and educating the 
public about the importance of oral health; and working to reduce barriers to dental care. Funding for the 
state public oral health program was cut in 2009, with limited funding to sustain the Hospital and 
Community Dental Services Branch only, which has been positioned under the Developmental Disabilities 
Division since then. 
 
1 Hawai'i Public Health Institute (HIPHI) is a hub for building healthy communities, providing issue-based advocacy, education, and 
technical assistance through partnerships with government, academia, foundations, business, and community-based organizations.

According to HRS §321-61 - 63, the Hawaii State Department of Health must study and appraise the 
State's dental health needs and resources, and shall foster the development and expansion of dental 
health services to the people of the State. To accomplish this the department requires adequate resources 
to: 
• 
Conduct research, investigations, experiments, demonstrations, and studies relating to the 
incidence, causes, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of dental diseases; 
• 
Supervise, provide, and direct clinical dental health services for adults and children in the State; 
• 
Develop and conduct a program of dental health education of the public; 
• 
Provide information and education relating to dental health to public health nurses, teachers, 
social workers, and others who deal in a professional capacity with the public, through 
publications, seminars, institutes, and other appropriate means; and 
• 
Provide training for professional personnel to staff state and local dental health programs. 
 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently only provide funding to 20 states and one US 
territory2. Hawai‘i is not among these states. Furthermore, the extent to which federal funding will reach 
Hawai‘i for oral health programming in the future is more uncertain than ever. 
 
It has been more than 10 years since the most recent statewide oral health assessments of Hawai‘i 
residents. Key findings indicate that Hawai‘i’s keiki experience the highest rates of tooth decay in the 
nation3. The state continues to see high rates of emergency department (ED) utilization for preventable 
oral health conditions, with the greatest rate of ED visits occurring on neighbor islands, and among 
Medicaid patients4. Additionally, Just over half of children with Medicaid (54.3%) are receiving preventive 
dental services5. 
 
It is imperative that we invest resources to re-establish the state’s oral health program to better 
understand the full scope of oral health needs, resources, infrastructure, and to identify evidence-based 
best practices, which can best address the barriers and gaps in our existing oral health care systems. 
dedicated staffing under the Department of Health is necessary to identify and develop the strategies 
that address the critical needs of our communities, provide ongoing assessment of oral health trends and 
systems, and work with stakeholders to develop effective approaches to improving oral health outcomes 
for all Hawai‘i residents.  
 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify.

Testimony Supporting HB 300
HTH 50] — Developmental Disabilities, Page 24-25, Item
No. 18
The Arc ol‘ Kona is a private non-prolit organization that provides
services to people with disabilities that encourage personal growth
and quality of life through empowerment and choice throughout
the Island ofllawaii. We support individuals with Intellectual and
Developmental Disabilities (I/DD) through the l\/ledicaid l‘)l5(e)
Home and Community Based Services (HCBS) Waiver
administered by the Department ofllealth, Developmental
Disabilities Division. As the President/CHO ofthe Are ol‘ Kona, l
am writing on behalf of our organization and the people and
liamilies we serve to strongly support budget item number 18
HTH 501 — Developmental Disabilities on page 24-25 of HB
300.
llTll 501 includes the addition ol‘$l0,l00,000 for FY 2026 and
$21,400,000 FY 2027 to increase urgently needed services through
the Medicaid l‘)l5(c) Home and Community-Based Services
(I ICBS) Waiver for people with l/DD and their lamilies.
Why This Funding is Critical
-
Severe Workforce Shortage: Providers are unable to ()llCl
competitive wages to l)ireet Support l’rol’essionals (DSl’s),
leading to a crisis in care.
-
Inadequate Reimbursement Rates: Rates have not kept
pace with rising costs, putting services at risk.
v
Rate Study Findings: Alter the 2026 minimum wage
increase, service costs will be 24% higher than current
reimbursement rates. l*ederal l\/ledicaid requires sulilicient
rates to ensure access to care.

~
Access & Equity: Funding supports workforce
development, improves access on neighbor islands,
expands employment opportunities, and increases
residential options.
o
Preventing Service Cuts: Without funding, providers may
reduce services or serve fewer individuals, leaving
families without support.
o
Avoiding institutionalization: Families should not have to
choose between placing a loved one in a facility or leaving
the workforce to provide care to their family member.
-
Cost-Saving Measure: HCBS services save the state
$77,000 per person annually compared to institutional
care. Medicaid Waiver funding also brings a $0.48 federal
match per state dollar invested, saving taxpayers $300
million annually.
This funding is essential in keeping families together, preventing
unnecessary institutionalization, and ensuring individuals with
l/DD receive the support and assistance they need to live
independent, self-determined lives.
llawai‘i’s l/DI) HCBS Waiver program serves 3,000 of our most
vulnerable individuals each year, supported by 1,900 DSPs who
help them fully participate in the community.
Thank you for your time and consideration, as well as the
opportunity to provide testimony in support of HB 300 llTll 501.

COMMENTS ON HB 300:  RELATING TO THE STATE BUDGET 
 
TO:  
House Committee on Finance 
FROM: 
Tina Andrade, President and CEO, Catholic Charities Hawai‘i 
Hearing: 
Wednesday, 3/5/25; 9:00 am; Room 308 or via videoconference 
 
Chair Yamashita, Vice Chair Takenouchi, and Members, Committee on Finance: 
Catholic Charities Hawai‘i provides comments on HB 300, the state budget bill, which 
appropriates funds for the operating and capital improvement budget of the Executive Branch for 
fiscal years 2025–2026 and 2026–2027. 
Catholic Charities Hawai‘i (CCH) has provided social services in Hawai‘i for over 77 years, 
assisting 40,000 people annually. Our services target the most vulnerable in Hawai‘i, including 
elders, veterans, children, families, houseless individuals, and immigrants. As a member of the 
Hawai‘i True Cost Coalition, we stand with over 70 organizations serving 500,000 residents. 
Community-based agencies deliver essential services but face severe funding challenges. State 
funding has remained stagnant for over a decade, and potential federal cuts threaten their ability 
to serve. Without action, critical services relied upon by Hawai‘i families are at risk, especially 
in the wake of crises like the Maui wildfires. 
We urge decisive action to secure funding for essential services through the Department of 
Human Services, the Department of Health, and the Judiciary. 
Catholic Charities Hawai‘i also strongly supports the following HB 300 budget items: 
• 
HMS 224: Fund core homeless services in the base budget of DHS, including Housing 
First, Family Assessment Centers, Homeless Outreach, Legal Services, and Rapid Re-
housing. 
• 
BED 160: Allocate $50 million annually to Tier 1 and $75 million annually to Tier 2 of 
the Rental Housing Revolving Fund. 
• 
GIA: Provide $175,000 to Lanakila Multi-Purpose Senior Center to support education, 
recreation, and social services that enable seniors to remain independent in our 
community. 
Catholic Charities Hawai‘i respectfully requests increased funding to reflect the true cost of 
sustaining health and human services for Hawai‘i residents. 
If you have any questions, please contact our Legislative Liaison, Betty Lou Larson, at (808) 
527-4813. 
 

 
 
Testimony on House Bill 300 
Relating to the State Budget 
Submitted by Dr. Steven Pine, DDS. 
March 3,2025 
 
 
The Honorable Representative Kyle T. Yamashita, Chair 
The Honorable Representative Jenna Takenouchi, Vice Chair 
Members of the Committee on Finance 
 
Re: Support for HB 300 – Relating to the State Budget 
 
Dear Chair Yamashita, Vice Chair Takenouchi, and Members of the Committee on Finance, 
 
I appreciate the opportunity to submit testimony in support of HB 300, which appropriates critical 
funding for the operating and capital improvement budget of the Executive Branch for fiscal years 
2025-2026 and 2026-2027. 
 
As the Chief Dental Officer for Hawai’i Island Community Health Center, I have witnessed firsthand the 
urgent need for sustainable funding for Hawai‘i’s public oral health programs. Oral health is inextricably 
linked to overall health and well-being, yet Hawai‘i continues to experience some of the highest rates of 
dental disease in the nation, disproportionately affecting low-income families, kūpuna, Native Hawaiian 
and Pacific Islander communities, and individuals with disabilities. 
 
Hawai‘i has been without a fully funded public oral health program since 2009. Currently, 42 states 
have dedicated public dental health staff to assess community needs, educate the public, and reduce 
barriers to care. However, Hawai‘i remains one of the few states without this critical public health 
infrastructure. The Department of Health (DOH) is mandated under HRS §321-61 - 63 to study and 
improve the state’s oral health, yet without sufficient resources, this statutory obligation remains 
largely unmet. 
 
The need for investment in oral health infrastructure is clear: 
• Hawai‘i’s children experience the highest rates of tooth decay in the nation. 
• Emergency department visits for preventable dental conditions remain alarmingly high, 
particularly on the neighbor islands and among Medicaid recipients. 
• Only 54.3% of children with Medicaid receive preventive dental services—far below national 
benchmarks. 
 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently funds state oral health programs in only 
20 states and one U.S. territory—Hawai‘i is not one of them. Without dedicated state investment, we 
cannot rely on federal funding to address these longstanding disparities. 

 
 
 
HB 300 represents an opportunity to restore the state’s public oral health program and allocate the 
necessary resources to: 
• Conduct statewide oral health assessments to understand the full scope of need. 
• Develop evidence-based prevention strategies to reduce dental disease. 
• Improve public education on oral health’s impact on overall health. 
• Strengthen the workforce pipeline to address shortages in dental professionals. 
 
Without action, we will continue to see worsening disparities, preventable suffering, and increasing 
healthcare costs due to untreated dental disease. Funding the restoration of a robust state oral health 
program is a cost-effective investment in public health, improving outcomes and reducing strain on 
emergency services. 
 
For these reasons, I urge the committee to support HB 300 and prioritize funding for the Department of 
Health’s oral health initiatives. 
 
Mahalo for your time and consideration. 
 
Sincerely,

Hearing Date and Time: March 05, 2025, 9:00am (Room 308) 
Re: 
 
 
Testimony of Holomua Collaborative – Support  
 
Aloha Chair Yamashita, Vice Chair Takenouchi, and members of the committee: 
 
Mahalo for the opportunity to submit testimony in support of HB300, Relating to The 
State Budget. In particular, Holomua Collaborative writes in support of three items in 
the budget: 
 
1. $1,000,000 for FY 26 for the Department of Human Resources Development 
(DHRD) to conduct a civil service position classification and compensation 
study; 
2. Adds $338,150 for FY 26 and $1,343,400 for FY 27 for consultant services to 
maintain Tax System Modernization (TSM) projects; and  
3. Adds 6.00 permanent positions and $294,796 for FY 26 and 7.00 permanent 
positions and $664,592 for FY 27 for the Department of Taxation (DOTAX) to 
establish a Tax System Modernization Office and integrate the Internal 
Revenue Services' Direct File Project with TSM. 
 
In October 2024, a survey1 gathering information about the day-to-day financial 
experience of local workers was released, and it suggests that the high cost of living 
and resulting outmigration is a growing crisis that has the potential to reach 
staggering levels. When nearly 1,500 local workers were asked if they may need to 
move to a less expensive state, only thirty-one percent answered a definitive “no,” 
while sixty-nine percent said “yes” or “unsure.” Each local worker and family we lose 
to the continent contributes to a loss of our economy, our culture, and our family. 
 
Many factors contribute to the high cost of living in the state, and Holomua 
Collaborative is devoted to finding ways to keep all local working families in Hawai‘i 
by making sure they can afford to stay. Each of the budget requests identified above 
represent a way to help families stay in Hawai‘i.  
 
Civil Service Position Classification and Compensation Study 
 
State government jobs are categorized and filled via 1,400+ civil service position 
classifications, which form the basis for 17,000+ position descriptions. This system and 
the 1,400 + position descriptions are outdated in terms of structure, requirements, and 
compensation, and need to be modernized to reflect current workforce needs and 
attract a broader pool of applicants. The DHRD budget request detailed above will 
accomplish this.

Page 2 of 2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As of November 2024, the State government had a job vacancy rate of 24%.2 with 
nearly 31% of employees eligible to retire within five years.3 The large vacancy rate 
contributes to less efficient government operations and services, including delayed 
delivery of services relied upon by neighbors in need, such as SNAP, MedQuest, and 
Unemployment Insurance. Furthermore, as long as the position classifications and 
compensation remain outdated, our local workforce will be less inclined to seek out 
and apply for State jobs over better opportunities on the continent. With so many 
vacancies available and the volume of outmigration we face, making State 
employment a competitive and attractive choice is an efficient investment that will 
pay dividends in our future. 
 
Maintain Tax System Modernization (TSM) projects, establishing a TSM Office, 
and Integrating the Internal Revenue Services' Direct File Project with TSM 
 
On average, taxpayers spend approximately 13 hours and $270 preparing their taxes 
each year.4 A significant number of these taxpayers are low-income workers using fee-
based tax preparers such as TurboTax and H&R Block. This reduces the amount of 
money they may get back in tax credits on preparation services. A free program from 
the Internal Revenue Service, Direct File, is currently available for families to prepare 
and file federal and/or state taxes in twenty-five states. The Department of Taxation 
(DOTAX) already uses the same vendor as the participating states.  
 
Including funding in the State budget for expanding access to Direct File for the use of 
residents to file their taxes could save Hawai‘i taxpayers $34.6M in filing fees annually 
and deliver $83.1M in total value to Hawai‘i taxpayers, between filing fees, the time 
cost of filing, and additional federal credits claimed.5 Including the funding for the 
maintenance of the Tax System Modernization (TSM) projects is necessary to have an 
e-filing option to integrate with Direct File. 
 
We urge you to support these budget requests to make life in Hawai‘i a little easier for 
all our neighbors.

Re: HTH 501 Developmental Disabilities 
We wish to comment on this Budget Request. 
Twenty years ago our office entered into a Settlement Agreement in a lawsuit that we brought 
against the Developmental Disabilities Division which obligates them to annually assess the 
needs of the DD population and make specific efforts to secure a Budget that will adequately 
serve them. 
We have reason to believe that they have failed to comply with the Settlement Agreement and 
have failed over the years to seek appropriate funding for the DD Home and Community Based 
Waiver. We say this in part because we have seen a growing decrease in the amount of services 
provided to waiver recipients as well as a tightening up of eligibility criteria. This has greatly 
impacted several of our clients. That would not occur if they were carrying out the terms of the 
Settlement. 
We note that while the current request seeks an additional 10 million dollars we have been told 
that this is allocated to pay higher rates to providers. While we have no issue with providing 
sufficient incentives to DD providers, what is needed are sufficient funds to properly serve the 
ID/DD population. 
We urge the Legislature to closely scrutinize the HTH 501 Budget Request and make necessary 
adjustments so that the State will comply with its legal obligation.

TESTIMONY ON HB 300  
(Opposing Funding for New Jail Construction) 
 
 
TO: 
 
Chair Yamashita, Vice-Chair Takenouchi & FIN Committee Members 
 
FROM: 
Nikos Leverenz, Board President 
 
DATE:  
March 5, 2025 (9:00 AM) 
 
 
Drug Policy Forum of Hawaiʻi, a member of the Reimaging Public Safety Coalition, strongly 
opposes additional expenditures to construct a new jail facility in Halawa, which is 
estimated to cost over $1 billion.  
 
A recent analysis by the Prison Policy Initiative noted that pretrial incarceration is overused 
in the state, undermining the presumption of innocence and negatively implanting public 
health and public safety. More jail beds would worsen lasting racial disparities in the state’s 
criminal legal system, with those who are Native Hawaiian, Pasifika, or Black subject to 
heightened levels of surveillance, arrest, prosecution, incarceration, and post-release 
supervision. Further, a new facility will not rectify the persistent staffing problems faced at 
facilities administered by the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.  
 
The memo observes that “people incarcerated at OCCC are overwhelmingly there for low-
level, non-violent charges, including technical violations of probation conditions, and there 
are a wealth of opportunities to decrease Hawaiʻi's jail population to the point where new 
jail construction may not be necessary.” As such, the state should endeavor to enact 
meaningful probation reforms, including limits on the use of technical violations as a basis 
for re-incarceration. As it stands, Hawaiʻi leads the nation in its average term of probation 
(59 months). 
 
Modification of pre-trial practices can help reduce jail populations and further justice by 
helping to ensure that people are not incarcerated before they are convicted of an 
underlying offense. A short list of modifications includes creating a presumption of release 
for all arrestees in statute; reducing or eliminating the use of cash bail; and ensuring due 
process protections for bail hearings.

The state should instead dedicate additional resources to providing behavioral health care 
services to those in need outside of the context of the criminal legal system, including 
outpatient mental health support, counseling for substance use problems, and treatment 
for substance use disorder.  
 
Modifications to underlying laws related to the possession of drugs for personal use, which 
is erroneously labeled “promotion” under current HRS provisions, and the repeal of the 
state’s drug paraphernalia statute would also help reduce jail populations as well as align 
state policy with the recommendations of the American Public Health Association, the 
American Medical Association, the Global Commission on Drug Policy, and other medical 
groups and non-governmental organizations.

SUPPORT HB300 RELATING TO THE STATE BUDGET 
  
Honorable Chair Yamashita, Vice Chair Takenouchi, and Members of the Committee, 
On behalf of the Hawaiʻi Association for Behavior Analysis (HABA), we sincerely thank you for 
including Medicaid rate increases for applied behavior analysis (ABA) services for children with 
autism in last year’s budget bill. After nearly a decade of stagnant rates, 2025 finally brings an 
increase—but the funds that were passed were nonrecurring, meaning they are only secured for 
2025. We urge you to maintain the appropriation for this included in the Executive Budget 
submitted for this year’s budget bill to maintain the increased rates and prevent disruptions in 
services for families who depend on them.  
ABA is a medically necessary service covered under QUEST for individuals under 21 with an 
autism diagnosis, as mandated by federal law through the Early and Periodic Screening, 
Diagnostic, and Treatment (EPSDT) benefit (Social Security Act §1905(r)). EPSDT ensures that 
children receive comprehensive and necessary healthcare services, including ABA, and 
remains a protected federal mandate. Given its focus on children, EPSDT funding is unlikely to 
face federal cuts if there are reductions to Medicaid. However, while the federal government 
requires coverage, states play a critical role in determining reimbursement rates and ensuring 
providers can continue offering services. Without adequate state funding, access to care 
remains limited, and families face significant barriers to obtaining the support their children 
need. 
As noted in the recent ABA rate study (DC233), providers continue to face workforce 
shortages due to low reimbursement rates, leading to long waitlists and limited access to 
services, particularly on neighbor islands. Some providers have even stopped accepting 
QUEST due to unsustainable rates. Without competitive reimbursement, families will continue to 
struggle to access the services their children desperately need.  

 
 
The Legislature took an important first step by increasing rates last session, but these were 
just made available on 01/01/2025 and many providers are still working on their updated 
contracts with the QUEST health plans therefore not yet able to bill the increased rates. 
However, we know that without maintaining these adjustments, providers will not be able to 
offer competitive pay and will likely lose staff, resulting in families facing uncertainty about their 
children’s care or being unable to access care at all. Investing in ABA services now ensures 
children receive early intervention, reducing long-term costs and allowing them to reach their 
full potential. 
We urge you to maintain funds for QUEST ABA rates in the DHS budget appropriations to 
secure a sustainable future for ABA services in Hawaiʻi. Thank you for your time and 
consideration.

TESTIMONY FOR HB 300 RELATING TO THE STATE BUDGET 
 
Hawai‘i Friends of Restorative Justice (HFRJ) supports the appropriations in this bill for the 
Department of Education and the Office of Hawaiian Affairs. We strongly oppose the Department of 
Corrections and Rehabilitation’s request for $30 million for a bigger O‘ahu jail. The state has already 
spent about $45 million on planning incarceration in the last decade.  
Instead of investing more in incarceration infrastructure, these funds should be redirected to 
education to address the root causes of crime that provide a more effective long-term solution for 
public safety. Incarceration has done little to reduce recidivism or improve community well-
being. Research consistently shows that investments in education—especially early childhood 
education, vocational training, and higher education—significantly reduce crime rates by 
providing individuals with the skills and opportunities needed to succeed. Education reduces 
poverty, fosters economic growth, and strengthens communities, whereas jails perpetuate cycles 
of disadvantage, disproportionately impacting Native Hawaiians and other marginalized groups. 
Spending $30 million on planning a new jail is an irresponsible use of taxpayer dollars, 
especially when our schools face funding shortages, teacher shortages, and inadequate 
infrastructure, and we face federal funding cuts. Instead, we should prioritize expanding 
educational access, supporting after-school programs, and increase mental health resources in 
schools, all of which have been shown to prevent criminal behavior and improve social 
outcomes.  
Rather than perpetuating a punitive system that has failed to rehabilitate individuals or enhance 
public safety, we need to redirect our resources toward proactive solutions that uplift 
communities. Education is the most powerful tool to break cycles of incarceration, reduce crime, 
and ensure a more just and prosperous future for our state.  
We urge you to reject DCR’s request for additional jail planning funds and instead allocate these 
resources to education initiatives that will provide lasting benefits to our people. 
Mahalo for your service. Please contact me if you have any questions about our position.

Testimony of The Nature Conservancy 
Supporting HB300, Relating to the State Budget. 
Committee on Finance 
March 5, 2025 at 9am 
Conference Room 308 and via Videoconference 
 
Dear Chair Yamashita, Vice Chair Takenouchi, and Members of the Committee: 
 
The Nature Conservancy (TNC) Hawai‘i and Palmyra supports funding to enhance, protect, 
conserve, restore and manage Hawaii’s natural resources in HB300, especially the line items 
expressed below.  
 
1. TNC supports the DLNR and the Governor’s request for LNR401 Ecosystem Protection, 
Restoration, and Fisheries Management.  
 
These investments in programs to support our marine and coastal resources will ensure 
that the reefs that line our coasts, which are environmental, economic, recreational, and 
cultural treasures, will continue to support our island lifestyle and livelihoods. Each year, 
our reefs provide flood protection to people, property, and jobs valued at more than $836 
million, support nearshore fisheries worth $13.4 million, and contribute more than $1.2 
billion through reef-related tourism to the state’s economy. We must continue to make the 
vital investments to protect and sustainably manage our aquatic resources.  
 
2. TNC supports the DLNR and the Governor’s request for LNR404 Water Resources, which 
funds the Commission on Water Resource Management Hawai‘i Mesonet (SEQ# 104-001). 
The Hawai‘i Mesonet informs disaster preparedness and response, climate research and 
forecasts and long-term environmental monitoring through a network of sensing 
equipment strategically located throughout Hawai‘i. One such sensor is located at TNC’s 
Waikamoi Preserve and is linked directly to the National Weather Service. Accurate 
weather data, including wind, precipitation and humidity, directly informs management of 
Waikamoi Preserve. For example, our team uses this data to predict where the integrity of 
predator fencing may be compromised, which is critical to the overall health of the 
landscape. Long-term data is needed to track changes in climate that affect our forests and 
oceans, and the Mesonet network fills gaps that allow for climate and water modelers to 
make better predictions about our water resources.

3. TNC supports the DLNR and the Governor’s Message request for LNR407 Natural Area 
Reserves & Watershed Management.  
These funds provide critical funding that provides long-term conservation of watershed 
forests statewide. These investments help reduce erosion, prevent extinction of 
endangered species, increase carbon storage in native forests, and protect Hawai‘i’s fresh 
water. Forested watersheds provide Hawai‘i with drinking water, cultural resources, and 
are home to unique plants and wildlife found nowhere else in the world. Protection is 
needed to safeguard these invaluable resources in the face of threats such as invasive 
species and climate change. Continuing investment in these vital resources will have 
immense long-term impacts for our forests and far beyond. 
4. TNC supports the DLNR and the Governor’s Capital Improvement Plan request for 
$1,750,000 in FY 26 for Pohakea Fire Prevention and Suppression Infrastructure. 
Three watersheds including Pohakea, Waikapu, and Waiakoa all flow into Maʻalaea Bay, 
which once supported unique limu and coral reef habitat on the leeward Maui coastline. 
Stormwater infrastructure modifications, increased ungulate presence and fire have led to 
big mud slides entering the bay during storms. Hui o ka Wai Ola data show that the bay is 
impaired from turbidity, and working to protect the mauka watershed is key to restoring 
ecosystem health. Fire and erosion control at Ma‘alaea is needed to contain wildfires at 
this ignition hotspot and prevent them from spreading. The State’s proposal would 
leverage federal funds to replace high fuel load invasive vegetation with native plants 
adapted for riparian green belts. The strategic restoration of these fire-prone lands 
provides important cost-effective protections for life and property in nearby Ma‘alaea 
Village. The proposed improvements would hold back sediments from reaching the unique 
and valuable Ma’alaea coral reefs and harbor, thereby saving on future restoration costs.  
 
5. TNC supports DNLR and the Governor’s Operating Budget request for $3,000,000 in FY26 
for West Maui fire prevention: Ukumehame Wetland and Stream, Maui.  
Besides providing habitat for endangered water birds and other native plant and animal 
species, the Ukumehame Wetland serves as hazard mitigation for environmental threats 
such as lowland wildfire, coastal flooding and upland erosion, protecting coastlines and the 
precious 939-acre Olowalu coral reef system. These wetlands are degraded from sugar-era 
land use and draining, and once provided key habitat for wetland birds, plants, insects and 
fish, as documented through ‘olelo, photos, wetland surveys and historical maps. 
Restoration of Ukumehame Wetlands is positioned for success as the lands designated for 
the project are generally undeveloped and already under state jurisdiction, and the 
investment will unlock additional federal support critical to its completion. This is an 
excellent opportunity to expand the effective foot print of the wetland from 25 to 88 acres, 
replace high fuel load invasive plants with low stature native wetland vegetation, and

restore riparian buffers and fuel breaks at two gulches that feed to Ukumehame Wetland, 
Makiwa and Hana‘ula. 
These budget items contribute to the resilience, sustainability and continued health of our islands’ 
environment, economy, and quality of life. We thank you for appreciating the critical importance 
of protecting the lands and waters on which all life depends. 
 
Mahalo for the opportunity to testify in support of HB300. 
 
Guided by science, TNC is a non-profit organization dedicated to the preservation of the lands and waters upon which 
all life depends. The Conservancy has helped protect more than 200,000 acres of natural lands in Hawai‘i and Palmyra 
Atoll. We manage 40,000 acres in 13 nature preserves and have supported over 50 coastal communities to help protect 
and restore the nearshore reefs and fisheries of the main Hawaiian Islands.

Aloha 
As a working ranch and visitor destination, Kualoa Ranch depends on accurate, real-time 
weather data to ensure the safety of guests, staff, and livestock while managing diverse 
operations that include ranching, farming, conservation, and outdoor tourism. A Mesonet station 
installed within the ranch is already providing valuable data, helping to track rainfall, wind 
speeds, soil moisture, and temperature fluctuations that impact daily operations. 
Reliable climate data also supports long-term sustainability efforts, from watershed restoration 
to maintaining resilient agricultural practices that sustain both the ranch and the broader 
community. 
As climate variability continues to impact Hawaiʻi, the Mesonet provides essential data to 
mitigate drought, flooding, and wildfire risks. Continued investment in this network ensures that 
Kualoa Ranch and similar organizations can operate safely and sustainably while adapting to 
changing weather patterns. 
Funding for the Hawaiʻi Mesonet is an investment in the long-term resilience of Hawai‘i’s land, 
economy, and communities. Kualoa Ranch strongly supports continued funding through bill 
HB300, program number LNR404, for the Hawai‘i Mesonet, a vital resource that enhances 
environmental conservation, agriculture, and public safety across the state. 
Mahalo for considering this testimony.

SUPPORT HB300 RELATING TO THE STATE BUDGET 
  
Honorable Chair Yamashita, Vice Chair Takenouchi, and Members of the Committee: 
 
Mahalo for the opportunity to submit testimony in support of the budget appropriation 
for maintaining the QUEST rates for applied behavior analysis (ABA) submitted in 
the Executive Budget for DHS as part of HB300.  
BAYADA is a not-for-profit health care company committed to serving our community. 
We provide services across the state, with behavioral health services for QUEST 
members on Oahu and Maui.  
As a behavioral health service provider, we have struggled to meet the needs of 
children with autism on Med-QUEST due to the increased costs of operating a business 
without increased rates for our services. QUEST rates for the coverage of intensive 
behavioral therapy (IBT) for treatment of children under 21 years of age with autism 
spectrum disorder (ASD), also referred to as ABA, were set in 2015 and had not 
increased, despite the increased costs of living and increased costs for employers over 
the last 8 years. Wages have gone up nearly 30% since 2015 in Hawaiʻi, forcing 
businesses to shoulder the cost without proportionate rate increases, making it harder 
to attract candidates and businesses to the field of supporting individuals with autism 
and their families.  
We appreciate the efforts taken by this committee in 2024 to include funding for 
increased rates for ABA QUEST funded services. These funds were nonrecurring, only 
providing an increase for 2025, therefore it is imperative we pass additional legislation in 
this 2025 session to maintain these rates. 
ABA services are healthcare services for children mandated by Early and Periodic 
Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment (EPSDT) under Medicaid and are specific to 
children under 21, which will likely help in maintaining this program regardless of 
potential federal cuts. At this point, healthcare related payments, and specifically those 

 
 
 
for children, are not in the category of funds being targeted by the federal 
administration. 
Without the increased rates, we are not able to adequately serve the children with 
autism and their families who need us. As an organization, our values are compassion, 
excellence, and reliability; however, due to difficulties in attracting and retaining staff we 
find ourselves troubled that we cannot consistently deliver these values to our clients.  
Currently, we must maintain a waitlist for clients to access services because there is 
more demand than we are able to meet with our current providers. At our Oahu location, 
40% of those on our waitlist are QUEST members. At our Maui location, 66% are 
QUEST members. We closed our Big Island and Kauai insurance-based services, 
despite ongoing community need, due to losses based on unsustainable rates in 2018. 
These waitlists are only representative of our organization and are similar across 
providers.  
The increased rates approved in last year’s legislative session were published by Med-
QUEST for use beginning 01/01/2025 but then required each provider work with the 
managed care organization (MCO) administering the QUEST benefit to members to 
work out these new rates within their provider contracts. At this point, we have just 
started services under the increased rates for two of the health plans (three remaining) 
and therefore cannot yet report on data from the anticipated positive impact to staff 
hiring and retention and increased access to services for families on our waitlists.  
We respectfully request the Committee maintain funds for QUEST ABA rates in DHS’s 
budget as part of this bill.

House Bill No. 300 - RELATING TO THE STATE BUDGET 
 
To the Honorable Chair Kyle T. Yamashita, Vice Chair Jenna Takenouchi, and Members of the Committee: 
 
Kauaʻi Island Utility Cooperative (KIUC) is a not-for-profit utility providing electrical service to more than 34,000 
commercial and residential members. 
 
KIUC strongly supports continued funding through HB 300, program number LNR404, SEQ # 104-001 (Executive 
Request: Add Funds for Water Resources LNR404/GC), for the Hawai‘i Mesonet, a network of advanced weather 
stations providing real-time data essential for wildfire prevention, infrastructure protection, and public safety. 
 
As Kauaʻi’s electric cooperative, KIUC faces growing wildfire risks due to dry, windy conditions exacerbated by 
climate change. Reliable weather data is critical for assessing fire danger, managing vegetation near power lines, 
and making informed decisions about de-energizing lines when necessary. The 2012 Kōkeʻe wildfire, which 
burned over 3,000 acres, and recent brush fires in West Kauaʻi highlight the urgent need for better localized fire 
weather data. Hawai‘i Mesonet stations help track wind speed, humidity, and fuel moisture—key factors in 
wildfire behavior and prevention. 
 
Severe rainfall events also threaten our infrastructure. The historic April 2018 floods, which dropped nearly 50 
inches of rain in 24 hours, demonstrated the need for accurate precipitation and streamflow monitoring to 
protect substations, power poles, and hydroelectric facilities. 
 
The Hawai‘i Mesonet directly supports KIUC’s mission by enhancing wildfire prevention and response in a number 
of ways: 
 
• 
Enhancing Wildfire Prevention and Response: Real-time fire weather data helps KIUC assess risks and 
adjust power operations, reducing the need for precautionary shutoffs;  
• 
Protecting Critical Infrastructure – Advanced weather monitoring allows KIUC to anticipate and mitigate 
flooding impacts on substations and power lines; and  
• 
Supporting Renewable Energy Planning – Data on wind speeds, cloud cover, and precipitation informs 
efficient integration of Kaua‘i’s renewable energy resources.

As Kauaʻi moves toward a more resilient and sustainable energy future, accurate weather data is essential to 
safeguarding our grid. We urge the Legislature to support continued funding for this vital program.

House Committee on Finance 
Wednesday, March 5, 2025 
9:00 am 
Conference Room 308 
 
Aloha Chair Yamashita, Vice Chair Takenouchi, and Committee Members: 
 
Hawaii Dental Service (HDS) strongly supports HB 300, Relating to the State Budget, 
speciﬁcally to re-establish the mandated State Oral Health Program which was cut in 2009.  
 
Hawaii is one of eight states that does not maintain dedicated public dental health staﬀ 
responsible for assessing and monitoring the population’s oral health status, community 
needs, and infrastructure; oral health education; and working to reduce barriers to dental care 
as required by HRS §321-61 – 63. This statute states that the Hawaii State Department of 
Health must study and appraise the State's dental health needs and resources and shall foster 
the development and expansion of dental health services to the people of the State. 
 
Hawaii’s last statewide oral health assessment was conducted a decade ago in 2015, with 
Head Start data showing the highest rates of childhood tooth decay in the nation. It is 
imperative that we continue to assess the state of oral health in Hawaii so that we can develop 
eﬀective programs to help improve oral health outcomes, especially for our keiki.  
 
Preventable dental issues continue to drive high emergency room visits, and only half of 
Medicaid-enrolled children receive preventive care. Investing in oral health will improve access, 
reduce costs, and create lasting change. 
 
Dedicated oral health staﬀ and resources at the Department of Health will help address the 
longstanding gaps in access to dental care and education and would provide the necessary 
expertise to drive targeted solutions, prioritize oral health, and improve outcomes for all 
Hawai‘i residents. 
 
HDS and the HDS Foundation urge your support for funding to restore the State Oral Health 
Program and help Hawaii residents achieve healthier smiles.

RE: HB 300 - RELATING TO THE STATE BUDGET
Dear Chair Yamashita and members of the Committee,
The Special Education Advisory Council (SEAC), Hawaii’s State 
Advisory Panel under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, 
supports HB 300 relating to EDN 150 - funding for Special Education.
This bill appropriates funds for the operating and capital improvement 
budget of the Executive Branch for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-
2027.
SEAC received a budget briefing on February 14th by the Department’s 
Budget Branch and agreed with the priorities of the Office of Student 
Support Services for additional funding in the following areas:
•  $10 million each year for contracted skilled nursing services,
•  $1.8 million in FY 27 for 20 licensed Mental Health 
Interventionists  to support students at risk of suicide and needing 
intensive educational settings, and
•  $1.7 million for surveys and electronic platforms to capture data 
critical to managing student mental health.
While general education has seen a gradual decline in enrollment 
for K-12 students since the beginning of the pandemic, the special 
education population has remained stable.  These students are struggling 
to make up learning losses related to distance learning necessitated by 
the pandemic and often are experiencing higher rates of anxiety than 
their non disabled peers.   We ask your Committee to appropriate the 
necessary funds to enable them to experience academic and socio-
emotional growth.

Dear Chair Yamashita and Finance Committee Members, 
 
The Reimagining Public Safety in Hawai’i Coalition opposes provisions in the current 
budget bill that would appropriate $30 MILLION for planning relating to the proposed new jail 
to replace OCCC, $10 MILLION for a 10-year Department of Corrections Statewide Master 
Plan, and MILLIONS more for jail and prison expansion and maintenance. 
 
Hawai'i is at a crossroads. Lawmakers must make a critical decision about public safety and 
fiscal responsibility: spend $1 billion on a new jail to replace O’ahu Community Correctional 
Center (OCCC) or implement more cost-effective solutions that address the real issues at the 
heart of the crisis we see on our streets. 
 
Our criminal justice issues are primarily driven by an affordable housing and public health crisis. 
Currently, at least 40% of people in Hawaii's jails are homeless and many more are suffering 
from mental illness and substance addiction. Around 60% of the jail population are held pretrial, 
many because they cannot afford bail set as low as $50.  
 
This is also an issue of racial justice—30% of the OCCC population is Native Hawaiian. Failures 
to make reform are disproportionately borne by Native Hawaiians. 
 
Department of Corrections’ (DCR) top officials have bluntly stated that our overcrowding 
problem is primarily driven by the fact that most people sitting in jail right now shouldn’t be 
there. They also say that locking up people with mental illness is the least effective, most 
expensive option.  
 
Even our Governor has acknowledged we cannot arrest and jail our way out of these problems.  
 
The Solution to Overcrowding is Investing in Diversion Infrastructure, not a Bigger Jail 
 
In recent years, Hawaii’s key justice system actors, including police, prosecutors, public 
defenders, judges, and service providers have been convening to jointly identify ways to reduce 
incarceration. There’s clear consensus: diversion to housing and services will significantly 
reduce the jail population and recidivism, not to mention save millions in taxpayer dollars. 
Unfortunately, this robust mandate is currently falling far short due to severe underfunding of 
diversion infrastructure in Hawai’i. “Divert to where?”  is a common refrain by law enforcement 
and judges. Hawai’i County has no residential treatment center, residents have to fly to O’ahu. 

2 
Instead of an unnecessary new $1 billion super jail, the state must prioritize investing in a 
historic expansion of community based mental health treatment and a range of supportive 
housing—group homes, clean and sober beds, and permanent supportive housing.  
We also need big investments in the diversion workforce. For example, Hawai'i island has just 
one staff member conducting daily cell block assessments for diversion, leaving Kona 
completely neglected. 
 
Invest in What is Proven to Work and is Fiscally Responsible 
 
It costs $112,000 per year to incarcerate one adult in Hawai’i. Compare this to $30,000 a year to 
provide someone with supportive housing with wrap around services including mental health. 
 
By investing in services like supportive housing, we can improve rehabilitation. According to 
local non-profit Partners in Care, the recidivism rate is only 13% for people who receive 
supportive housing versus 50% for those that do not. 
 
Simply put, the state cannot afford both a $1 billion jail and adequate diversion infrastructure. 
The notion that jails will somehow become centers of rehabilitation while systematic diversion 
remains unfunded is fundamentally flawed.  
 
More affordable alternatives exist. Fulton County in Georgia recently abandoned plans for a 
similar $1.7 billion jail project, choosing instead to renovate their existing facility for $300 
million.  Hawai'i could pursue a similar path, either renovating OCCC by building a smaller 
facility at its current site or a Community Diversion Center that will help people actually solve 
the problems that bring them to court. 
 
Can we trust DCR to create a "rehabilitative" super jail? 
 
The Hawai'i Correctional System Oversight Commission recently sent a letter to Governor Green 
calling for a pause in jail planning, citing serious concerns about DCR’s record of ignoring their 
recommendations to address deficient rehabilitative programming and healthcare. The 
Commission stated that a new facility alone will not fix these systemic issues. 
 
We should not entrust almost a billion dollars of taxpayer money to a Department that refuses to 
accept oversight, and has already spent millions planning a jail unsuited for rehabilitation.   
 
Care First, Jails Last 
 
Pausing the DCR’s current plan doesn’t mean we stop progress—it means refocusing on what 
will actually help: reducing the jail population through bail reform and investing in diversion. 
 
We must invest in evidence-backed solutions rather than repeat failed approaches that are 
ineffective and reduce our ability to enact meaningful reforms moving into the future. Now is the 
time to turn the page to a care first, jails last approach to public safety.

Parents and Children Together (PACT) supports HB 300 Relating to the State Budget. 
We submit this testimony as a member of the Hawai‘i True Cost Coalition – over 70 community-
based non-profit organizations fighting to sustain essential social services for our communities 
and as an organization concerned about our community, especially those struggling with 
systemic inequities. 
 
Service providers work under the most challenging circumstances and must have specific skills 
to both engage individuals and navigate complex systems. They must be supported by high-
quality organizations that are sustainable and state funding is an important part of that. State 
contracts that do not increase over time as operating costs increase make this important work 
unsustainable. Now is the time to invest in services that help people in vulnerable situations 
attain safety, economic security and good health. The social safety net needs your robust 
support. 
 
Founded in 1968, PACT is a statewide community-based organization providing a wide array of 
innovative and educational social services to families in need.  Assisting more than 15,000 
people across the state annually, we help identify, address, and successfully resolve challenges 
through our 20 programs.  Among our services are early education programs, domestic violence 
prevention and intervention programs, child abuse prevention and intervention programs, 
childhood sexual abuse supportive group services, child and adolescent behavioral health 
programs, sex trafficking intervention, poverty prevention and community building programs.

Re:  
The Imperative of Allocating Adequate Funding to Protect Natural Resources  
 
 
Support HB300, Relating to the State Budget  
 
Aloha kākou, 
 
On behalf of our coalition’s leadership committee, we are writing in support of HB300, relating to the 
State Budget. We are voicing our strong support for funding for natural resource protection and 
restoration. The Care for ‘Āina Now Coalition is on a mission to conserve our cultural and natural 
resources and invest in our ʻāina to keep our community safe.  
 
The health of Hawai‘i’s environment is inextricably linked to the health of our people, communities, and 
future generations. Our natural and cultural resources provide over $6 billion in value to our economy 
each year, and stewardship of these resources have been underfunded for decades. It’s been estimated 
that we currently face a conservation funding gap of $560 million per year. Today, this underinvestment 
continues to be a liability and risk to public safety. The more time that passes without healing our 
environment, the more lives, places, and communities are at risk of being harmed. 
 
Our primary focus is adequate, permanent funding for the Department of Land and Natural Resources 
and community organizations to support stewardship and restoration of our natural resources. There are 
simple ways our State can safeguard our ʻāina and people including passing legislation that ensures 
allocation of funds for wildfire prevention and ecosystem resilience.  We will continue to advocate for 
measures that generate new funding sources to complement the expenditures the legislature will 
approve in the budget. 
 
This coalition, which works on the frontlines of natural and cultural resource management across the 
State, applauds the legislature for continuing to consider these solutions. We urge you to consider the 
crucial need for sustainable, broad-based investment to meet the immense challenges our environment 
faces, offset the impact left by nearly 10 million annual visitors, and invest in the long-term health of our 
communities. Hawaiʻi’s natural resources are invaluable to the livelihoods of our local residents and 
integral drivers of our statewide economy as well as our visitor industry. 
 
Mahalo for the opportunity to testify on this important measure.

RE: Public Comment re: HB 300 
 
Dear Chair Yamashita, 
Essential Access Health (Essential Access) welcomes the opportunity to comment on HB 300, 
and the importance of investing in reproductive health and family planning services, consistent 
with Gov. Green’s proposed budget. 
Essential Access advances reproductive equity and champions quality sexual and reproductive 
health care for all. We take a multidisciplinary approach to expanding options and pathways for 
accessing high-quality, patient-centered care through distributing public funding, policy 
advocacy, research, youth and community empowerment, and training and capacity building for 
the health care workforce. 
Essential Access has been a Title X federal family planning program grantee since the program 
was established in 1970, and re-introduced the Title X program to Hawai‘i in collaboration with a 
diverse network of providers and community partners in 2022. Title X has been a foundational 
part of our health care safety net for more than fifty years, primarily serving people with low 
incomes with critical health services like birth control, STI prevention and treatment, adolescent 
services, pregnancy options counseling, and lifesaving cancer screenings.  
The current Hawai‘i Title X network is the most robust and geographically diverse statewide 
provider network in the state’s history with the program and includes 13 health care agencies 
that receive Title X funding and 31 health centers that deliver services on Kauaʻi, Oʻahu, Lanai, 
Maui, and Hawaiʻi Island. The network consists of federally qualified health centers, Native 
Hawaiian Health Centers, rural health centers, the University of Hawai‘i, and Planned 
Parenthood. The network serves ten thousand patients annually – though this number is likely 
under-representative, as health centers become accustomed to Title X reporting systems. Forty 
percent of patients identify as Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, and nearly half are 
teenagers and young adults. 
We urgently ask you to support additional state investments in reproductive health and family 
planning services, consistent with Governor Green’s proposed budget. The hostile regulations 
during the first Trump Administration caused Hawai`i to leave the Title X program. Since 
reintroducing Title X funds and services back to the islands in 2022, we have been able to build 
back the Hawai`i Title X provider network and expand access to essential health care. But, in 
the current Trump Administration we expect swift and severe cuts and changes to the program, 
with the possibility of funding to Title X or the program itself being eliminated altogether. State 
investments will be critical to keep Hawai`i’s Title X network whole and sustain essential family 
planning and preventive services and culturally responsive outreach and education activities 
that are critical for linking community members to time sensitive care.  

 
Even with the current level of Title X funding ($2.1 million), there continue to be substantial 
unmet needs for equitable, affordable, and confidential sexual and reproductive health services 
in Hawai`i, particularly among teens, residents of Hawaiʻi with lower incomes, and individuals 
who live in rural regions. Access barriers contribute to health inequities, including significantly 
higher than average national rates of unintended pregnancy, teen birth rates, and maternal and 
infant mortality, particularly among Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander populations.  
Hawaiʻi has a longstanding history of expanding access to health care, but additional action and 
funding is needed to ensure that everyone in Hawaiʻi can get the reproductive health care they 
need. With a new federal government hostile to all forms of sexual and reproductive health care, 
state funding is urgently needed to protect the family planning safety net. 
Please contact me directly at Shovis@essentialaccess.org with any questions. Thank you. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Shannon Oliveri Hovis 
Vice President of Public Affairs

Hearing Date/Time: Wednesday, March 5, 2025 
Place: Hawaiʻi State Capitol, Rm. 308 and videoconference 
Re:  Testimony of Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates – Hawaiʻi in support of funding for sexual and 
reproductive health care 
  
Dear Chairs and Members of the Committee, 
Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates urges you to support sexual and reproductive health care in the 
budget and continue our state’s legacy of leadership of protecting access to family planning services and 
abortion care. Patients and providers are relying on lawmakers to hold the line. To maintain patients’ 
access to safety net family planning services, we request the 2025-27 operating budget general funds 
includes $3 million in sustainability funding to Planned Parenthood and $4.4 million to backfill Title 
X should the Trump Administration reimplement the domestic gag rule ($7.4 total over the 
biennium). We also encourage the legislature to prepare for potential additional devastating cuts from the 
Trump Administration and Congress, including banning federal Medicaid funds for gender affirming care 
and for Planned Parenthood. 
Safety net family providers are facing the perfect storm of rising health care and labor costs, workforce 
shortages, and increased patient volumes. Providers across the state are struggling to keep up, leading to 
clinic closures, layoffs, and reduction of services. Safety net providers continue to face financial losses that 
have only deepened since the fall of Roe v. Wade, and we anticipate the Trump Administration will make a 
dire situation worse.  
 
PPAA is requesting $3 million over two years to support PPGNHAIK’s Oahu and Maui health 
centers with sustainability funding to help our health centers stay afloat. Planned Parenthood is the 
leading safety net family planning provider in Hawai’i, and our clinics are facing significant financial 
losses every year due to low reimbursement rates, inadequate family planning funding over the past 
decade, COVID and the related loss of savings, and inflation and rising costs across the board in the health 
care sector. Our patient mix also means we often are serving patients who are low income or underinsured 
and receive discounted or free care, which we often offset and subsidize. With current funding levels, we 
lose approximately $250 for every patient who walks in our doors. This funding would allow us to 
maintain patients’ access to care, competitive wages for our staff, health center maintenance, invest in our 
expanded telehealth program, and maintain other logistical support. 
In the coming months, we also anticipate the lawmakers in Washington, D.C. will take dramatic action to 
gut access to sexual and reproductive health. These attacks include reimplementing the domestic gag rule 
and forcing Hawaiʻi providers out of the Title X family planning program; barring Planned Parenthood 
from serving Medicaid patients; banning federal Medicaid coverage of gender affirming care; and 
attempting to ban or severely restrict abortion nationwide. These are existential threats to safety net 
family planning providers and patients, even here in Hawaiʻi. Other providers would be unable to 
absorb the thousands of patients who rely on safety net providers for care, leading to increased unintended 

2 
 
pregnancies, higher rates of sexually transmitted infections, poorer health outcomes, and denied life-saving 
preventive care. 
Anticipating the reimplementation of the Title X gag rule, safety net family planning providers are also 
requesting $4.4 over two years to backfill lost federal Title X funding. Title X funds provide a broad 
range of discounted family planning services and some STI services to thousands of patients in our state 
under 250% of the Federal Poverty Level, with a sliding fee scale that slides down to zero. Title X is 
primarily for folks who fall into insurance gaps or are underinsured – this includes those who are ineligible 
for Medicaid but who cannot afford insurance or those who cannot use insurance for privacy reasons, like 
young people, military members, or survivors of intimate partner violence.  Family planning clinics that 
rely on Title X funds are often the main source of health care for people of color, LGBTQ+ individuals, 
and people living in rural or geographically isolated areas. 
Sexual and reproductive health care is one of the most powerful and cost-effective investments Hawaiʻi 
can make. For every $1 invested in family planning, our state saves at least $7 on unintended pregnancy 
costs and long-term social service costs that can be routed to other critical services. Safety net family 
planning providers cannot continue to serve patients at present levels without this continued investment. 
And any lack of investment in the family planning safety net care only exacerbates the disparities 
experienced by Medicaid patients, who are disproportionately Black, Indigenous and Native, and Latinx 
due to centuries of racist health care policies.  
 
Our state should invest in services that ultimately lower costs and protect our most historically 
marginalized communities. Our ability to ensure Hawaiʻi’s financial stability depends on making 
smart investments that support our communities and keep people healthy. Reproductive freedom is a 
clear value of Hawaiʻi, and our state must continue to lead by maintaining funding to keep safety net 
providers serving patients.

Re:  
Support, HB300, Relating to the State Budget  
 
 
Aloha Chair Yamashita, Vice Chair Takenouchi, and Members of the Committee,  
 
On behalf of the Hawai‘i True Cost Coalition, we are writing in support of HB300, Relating to the State 
Budget.  
 
The Hawai‘i True Cost Coalition (TCC) represents over 70 nonprofit organizations serving more than 
500,000 residents statewide. We advocate for sustainable government funding to cover the true costs of 
essential services provided by Hawai‘i’s community-based nonprofits (CBOs). 
 
HB300 is crucial to maintaining services for vulnerable populations, including kupuna, children, 
individuals experiencing homelessness, and survivors of domestic violence. Without adequate funding, 
critical programs—such as health care, housing assistance, and legal aid—are at risk due to recent 
federal funding challenges. 
 
This bill reinforces the state’s commitment to Hawai‘i’s safety net by increasing funding for essential 
programs through the Department of Health, Department of Human Services, and Judiciary. These 
investments will support behavioral health services, food security initiatives, housing programs, legal 
aid, and much more.  
 
Many CBO contracts have remained stagnant for over a decade, despite rising costs. Nonprofits have 
stretched their own limited resources to sustain these programs, but this is no longer sustainable. 
Increased state funding is necessary to ensure these services continue for those who rely on them. 
 
HB300 is an investment in Hawai‘i’s people and future resilience. Mahalo for your time and 
consideration.

From:  Early Childhood Action Strategy  
Re:  
House Bill 300, Relating to the State Budget 
 
Early Childhood Action Strategy (ECAS) is a statewide cross-sector collaborative designed to improve 
the system of care for Hawai‘i’s youngest children and their families. ECAS partners work to align 
priorities for children prenatal to age eight, streamline services, maximize resources, and improve 
programs to support our youngest keiki.  
We are writing to outline our support for specific funding requests in House Bill 300 that would expand 
early learning opportunities for local keiki. ECAS feels strongly that supporting local keiki by providing 
them with access to high-quality learning environments is a worthwhile investment in our community’s 
future. 
We would like to specifically note our support for the following items: 
• Funds & Positions to open 50 additional Executive Office on Early Learning (EOEL) Public 
Prekindergarten classrooms over the next two years (EDN700) 
• Funding for Family Child Interaction Learning (FCIL) Program contracts (EDN700) 
Expansion of these programs is a critical step toward providing more local children and their families 
with high-quality early learning experiences that would better prepare them to succeed in elementary 
school, secondary school, and beyond. 
For these reasons, ECAS strongly supports the inclusion of these items HB300. 
Mahalo for the opportunity to provide this testimony.

_________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
Hawai‘i Public Health Institute (HIPHI)1 and the Healthy Eating, Active Living2 
(HEAL) coalition is in support with amendments of HB 300, which appropriates 
funds for the operating and capital improvement budget of the Executive Branch 
for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027. 
 
Please increase funding for the number of SNAP processing positions within the 
Department of Human Services. 
 
One in three households in Hawai‘i face food insecurity.3 Federal Supplemental 
Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits are a lifeline to many of these 
residents. Local families in need receive over $600 million annually in SNAP 
benefits.4 Unfortunately, the state has made accessing these benefits incredibly 
difficult. The state needs to improve the enrollment process and ensure local 
SNAP-eligible residents can receive the federal benefits they need. 
 
One Additional Worker Could Provide $2 Million in Federal Benefits 
Our SNAP office enrolls over 60,000 households annually, with less than 300 staff. 
That is more than 200 applications per staff member. Given the extreme backlog, 
adding one extra person to our SNAP department could be the difference 
between 200 families receiving SNAP benefits or not. At an average benefit per 
household of over $9,600 annually, this worker could help provide these 200 
families in need with $2 million in total federal food assistance.

Difficulty Enrolling 
Local Hawai‘i residents face immense barriers when trying to enroll in SNAP. Wait times often exceed four 
hours, causing many applicants to abandon the process out of frustration.5 Physical office locations are 
frequently inaccessible, further compounding the issue. When residents call the Department of Human 
Services (DHS) at their scheduled time for the required interview, their calls often go unanswered, leaving 
them unable to complete the process. Days or weeks later, they receive a callback from an unrecognized 
number at an unscheduled time, making it difficult for many applicants to answer—especially if they are at 
work or attending to other responsibilities. As a result, their missed interview leads to a denial of their 
application, creating an unfair cycle that denies residents the support they need. 
 
Currently, only 62% of eligible residents participate in the program, with participation among kūpuna 
even lower at just 35%.6 Systemic challenges, including incorrect application denials and missed interview 
opportunities, leave many families without the critical support they need. 
 
SNAP Office is Understaffed Following Increased Demand 
In fiscal year 2023-2024, the SNAP department processed 90,000 applications—a 50% increase from 
60,000 in 2017-2018.78 Despite this dramatic rise in demand, staffing levels have remained stagnant at 
around 275 employees for several years. This lack of sufficient staffing has made the enrollment process 
so difficult. To adequately support residents, the state must increase staffing to match the escalating 
demand. 
 
With demand already on the rise, fifty thousand additional households have become eligible for SNAP this 
month as the net income threshold was removed from the eligibility test.9 The need for more staff is 
urgent now—and will become even more critical as more families apply.​
​
We must increase both the number of budgeted positions and the pay for these roles to ensure they are 
filled. Raising salaries will help attract and retain qualified staff, while expanding available positions across 
the board will allow for targeted recruitment in areas with low vacancy rates, ensuring equitable access to 
services statewide. 
 
During the height of the pandemic our state sprung into action to improve the unemployment office 
staffing situation. With over 100,000 eligible individuals currently missing out on SNAP benefits, we must 
take bold, urgent action to streamline the application process and ensure that every qualified person can 
access the support they need.

10:1 Return on Investment 
Our low SNAP participation rate means far fewer Hawai‘i residents are accessing critical federal benefits 
than they should. Since half of SNAP processing staff salaries are covered by federal funds, increasing 
staffing levels would require the state to contribute only half the investment.10 
 
Adding an additional $10 million for staff on top of the roughly $20 million we spend now would bring in 
an additional $10 million in funding from the federal government for those staff. If that can help raise the 
SNAP participation rate from 62% to just 75%, we could bring in over $100 million in additional federal 
funding annually. A $10 million investment now would give more than a 10:1 return on investment, with 
more than $100 million coming back to the state. 
 
By failing to hire enough staff to ensure a smooth and efficient application process, we are effectively 
leaving federal dollars on the table and missing an opportunity to better support our community. 
 
Variable Vacancy Rates 
Many staff locations face high vacancy rates, making it challenging to fill positions. However, some sites 
have lower-than-average vacancies, presenting an opportunity to quickly expand the workforce. By 
adding positions to these locations, we could bring in dozens of new employees to strengthen the 
department. 
 
Please increase funding for SNAP staff positions and pay to ensure that federal SNAP benefits remain a 
reliable and accessible lifeline for all eligible residents in need.

___________________________________________________________________ 
 
Commit to Keiki is a statewide, non-partisan, public-private collaborative to ensure a 
brighter start for Hawai‘i’s youngest keiki. Led by a diverse Steering Committee, 
Commit to Keiki’s mission is to increase Hawai‘i’s investments in its youngest keiki 
by collaborating with elected officials and serving as a trusted partner and reliable 
resource for information on issues related to early childhood. 
 
Commit to Keiki strongly supports inclusion of the following item in House Bill 
300: 
 
Funding for Family Child Interaction Learning (FCIL) Program contracts (EDN700) 
  
FCIL programs have a proven track record of providing children up to the age of five 
and their families with highly engaging learning environments that are literacy-rich, 
support a child’s social and emotional development, strengthen parent/caregiver skills 
and improve school readiness. These programs are both efficient and impactful. 
 
It should also be noted that FCIL programs utilize multi-generational, culturally 
responsive approaches that typically perform well in working-class communities in 
which parents often rely on extended family to assist in childcare. This is especially 
noteworthy in our statewide community as a sizeable portion of parents do not—or 
cannot—use center-based childcare options. 
 
For these reasons, Commit to Keiki strongly supports the insertion of this item 
into the HB300.

RE: HB 300 – Relating to the State Budget – SUPPORT 
 
Chair Yamashita, Vice Chair Takenouchi, and members of the Committee: 
 
Thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony in support of HB 300, which appropriates 
funds for the operating and capital improvement budget of the Executive Branch for fiscal years 
2025-2026 and 2026-2027. 
 
Hunt Development Group is in support of CIP Item No. 25.00 under the Hawaii 
Community Development Authority that seeks $1,000,000 to prepare a programmatic 
environmental impact statement to cover infrastructure projects, developments and master 
plan implementation in Kalaeloa Community Development District (KCDD). 
 
In 2022 and 2023, the Legislature appropriated funds for electrical improvements along Saratoga 
Avenue.  In order to continue improving infrastructure in Kalaeloa to support new development 
projects, renovation and improvements, critical infrastructure improvements are needed. 
 
Hunt Development Group, in connection with its 535-acre portion of HCDA’s 3,700-acre 
Kalaeloa Master Plan, has succeeded in working with Gentry Homes to bring the first 389 new 
for-sale homes for local families to Kalaeloa, as well as completed construction on the new, 
98,000 square foot state-of-the-art VA ALOHA medical clinic.  
 
These were made possible, in part, by Hunt Companies taking on the long-needed upgrades to the 
infrastructure and operations of the water utility in Kalaeloa, followed by launching more than 
$35 million of roadway and utility infrastructure that provide benefit to the entire region.   
 
There is much more to be done in terms of roadways, regional connections, utilities, and 
additional water and power infrastructure to make Kalaeloa the vibrant new addition for West 
Oahu families that is envisioned by HCDA’s Master Plan, and this capital improvement 
appropriation to prepare a programmatic environmental impact statement is a vital initial step to 
that dream becoming reality.   
 
We appreciate your efforts to help spur much needed infrastructure to support community 
development in Kalaeloa.

HOUSE COMMITTEE ON FINANCE 
  
TESTIMONY ON HB 300 
RELATING TO THE STATE BUDGET 
 
Conference Room 308 & Videoconference  
9:00 AM  
  
Aloha Chair Yamashita, Vice-Chair Takenouchi, and Members of the Committee: 
  
I am Brian Miyamoto, Executive Director of the Hawaiʿi Farm Bureau (HFB).  Organized 
since 1948, the HFB is comprised of 1,800 farm family members statewide and serves as 
Hawaiʿi’s voice of agriculture to protect, advocate, and advance the social, economic, and 
educational interests of our diverse agricultural community.   
 
The Hawaiʿi Farm Bureau respectfully submits testimony in support of HB 300, with 
a request for funding allocations that will support Hawaii’s agricultural industry. 
 
Hawaii’s agricultural industry faces increasing challenges, including high operational 
costs, labor shortages, and climate-related disruptions. Strategic investments in 
infrastructure, research, and economic support programs are essential to ensure local 
food production's viability, reduce import dependency, and enhance the state’s overall 
food security. 
 
HFB respectfully requests the inclusion of the following HFB funding priorities in the state 
budget: 
 
AGR 122: $19.8 million for the Biosecurity Program: Invasive species have become one 
of the most devastating problems impacting Hawaiʿi. Many invasive species are 
damaging Hawaiʿi’s environment and economy. Hawaiʿi’s farmers and ranchers face 
ongoing challenges from invasive pests such as the coconut rhinoceros beetle, little fire 
ant, coffee berry borer, two-lined spittlebug, macadamia felted coccid, and varroa mite. 
These pests cause significant damage to crops, increase production costs, and threaten 
the viability of local agriculture. Once established, invasive species are costly and difficult 
to control, making prevention and early intervention essential. 
 
Proper funding for DOA is critical for protecting Hawaiʿi’s environment and economy and 
the health and lifestyle of its people through the support of invasive species prevention,

control, research, outreach, and planning. Funding permanent biosecurity positions 
ensures that DOA has the necessary personnel to conduct critical inspections, enforce 
quarantine regulations, and implement pest management programs. A well-staffed 
biosecurity team improves the state’s ability to detect and mitigate threats before they 
cause irreversible harm to Hawaiʿi’s farms and ecosystems. 
 
BED 170: $2.5 million for the Waiahole Water System: The Waiahole Water System 
serves over 5,600 acres of agricultural land on Oahu, providing critical irrigation for 
diversified farming operations. This funding request seeks to pay off the bond debt service 
on the system and repair the aging adit 8 tunnel, which is essential to maintaining water 
delivery. Continued operation and maintenance of this system are necessary for long-
term agricultural viability in Central and Leeward Oahu. 
 
UH 100: $5 million for Waimānalo Research Station: As part of a statewide network of 
agricultural experimental stations, the Waimānalo facility plays a key role in agricultural 
research and farmer education. It supports research on specialty crops, tropical fruits, 
sustainable farming techniques, and organic production. Unfortunately, many of the 
station’s facilities are deteriorating and need repair. Without modernization, the station’s 
ability to support Hawaiʿi’s agricultural community will be severely limited. Upgrading 
critical infrastructure will enhance research opportunities, attract external funding, and 
improve outreach to local farmers and ranchers. 
 
UH 100: $6 million for Magoon Research Station: A demand exists to address the need 
for a comprehensive approach to controlled-environment agriculture (CEA) and building 
a state-of-the-art CEA research and demonstration facility. Controlled-environment 
agriculture (CEA) technologies—such as hydroponics, aquaponics, aeroponics, and 
vertical farming—offer efficient, sustainable, and climate-resilient solutions for food 
production in Hawaii. A dedicated research and demonstration facility will provide a hub 
for agricultural innovation, allowing scientists and farmers to test and refine new growing 
techniques, water conservation strategies, and energy-efficient production systems. 
Incorporating these funding requests into the state budget aligns with the Legislature’s 
priorities of supporting local agriculture, strengthening food security, and fostering 
economic sustainability. Each of these investments will contribute to a more resilient and 
self-sufficient agricultural sector, ultimately benefiting Hawaii’s economy, environment, 
and communities. 
 
AGR 192: $5 million for the Farm to Families Program: Hawaiʿi faces persistent food 
security challenges, with many families experiencing limited access to fresh, locally grown 
food. At the same time, local farmers and ranchers struggle with unpredictable markets 
and barriers to expanding food distribution. The Farm to Families program presents a win-
win solution by linking local food production with communities in need, ensuring that 
Hawaiʿi’s agricultural products are used to feed Hawaiʿi’s people. 
 
We appreciate the committee’s consideration of these critical funding requests. 
 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify on this matter.

Committee on Finance 
Hawaiʻi State Legislature 
Date: March 4, 2025 
Chair Yamashita, Vice Chair Takenouchi, and Members of the Committee, 
Hawaiian Electric strongly supports continued funding through bill HB300, program number 
LNR404, for the Hawai‘i Mesonet, a statewide network of advanced weather stations that 
provides high-resolution climate data that can improve wildfire prevention and response. In the 
wake of recent devastating wildfires across the islands, it is clear that Hawai‘i urgently needs 
better fire weather monitoring to protect lives, communities, and critical infrastructure. 
As recent events in Hawai‘i and California have demonstrated, dry, windy conditions, 
exacerbated by prolonged drought and strong downslope winds can have deadly consequences. 
A lack of timely, localized weather data makes it difficult for emergency responders to anticipate 
the potential ignition and spread of wildfires. In these and other events, timely, site-specific wind 
speed, humidity, and temperature data could have helped first responders, utilities, and 
emergency managers make better-informed, life-saving decisions. 
Hawai‘i’s fire risk is increasing as drought conditions intensify across the islands. While 
Hawaiian Electric is expanding its own weather monitoring network, we welcome and encourage 
the development of the Hawai‘i Mesonet. As part of potential funding through bill HB300, 
program number LNR404, Hawaiian Electric encourages Hawai’i Mesonet to enhance the data 
transmission frequency of its weather stations from 15 minutes to 10 minutes, which would 
allow the data to become more timely. Together, the data provided are critically important for: 
(1) Monitoring Fire Weather Conditions – Mesonet stations provide continuous, publicly 
accessible updates on wind speeds, humidity, and fuel moisture levels; (2) Guiding Wildfire 
Mitigation Strategies – Utilities need accurate wind and weather forecasts to assess whether 
power lines should be de-energized in high-risk areas during extreme fire weather conditions; 
and (3) Improving Emergency Response – data allows firefighters to anticipate potential fire 
weather conditions and allocate resources effectively. 
Hawaiian Electric is committed to minimizing wildfire risk and recognizes that better weather 
monitoring is essential to this effort. Investing in the Hawai‘i Mesonet will provide utilities, first

responders, and communities with additional tools necessary to mitigate future fire disasters and 
build a more resilient Hawai‘i. 
We urge the Legislature to support funding for this critical program.

Healthcare Association of Hawaii  
 
Re: 
Support 
HB 300, Relating to the State Budget 
 
The Healthcare Association of Hawaii (HAH), established in 1939, serves as the leading voice of 
healthcare on behalf of 170 member organizations who represent almost every aspect of the 
health care continuum in Hawaii.   Members include acute care hospitals, skilled nursing 
facilities, home health agencies, hospices, assisted living facilities and durable medical 
equipment suppliers.  In addition to providing access to appropriate, affordable, high-quality 
care to all of Hawaii’s residents, our members contribute significantly to Hawaii’s economy by 
employing over 30,000 people statewide. 
 
We are writing today to strongly support continued investment in essential workforce and 
healthcare programs.  In particular, we would like to highlight an additional two years of 
funding to continue proven healthcare workforce development programs for high school 
students and current nurses. This request is largely similar to funding that the legislature passed 
in Act 89, SLH 2024, which has already been deployed to support these innovative programs 
that are critical to addressing the persistent workforce shortages in healthcare. In our 
organization’s most recent demand survey, we found that there are nearly 4,700 openings for 
non-physician, patient-facing positions in the state’s hospitals, nursing homes, clinics, and other 
healthcare settings. The need for entry-level positions, especially certified nurse aides (CNAs), 
continues to grow as our population ages. 
 
In 2023, the high school certificate programs supported 105 students working to get certified as 
CNAs, phlebotomists, medical assistants, and patient service representatives at 14 schools 
across the state. Students in the program saw a 98 percent completion rate with a 74 percent 
employment rate, a significant improvement from previous years due to the heavy employer 
involvement and wrap-around services. Over the same time period, the CNA to LPN glidepath 
supported approximately 40 individuals to continue working full-time while pursuing their 
education and licensure as LPNs over a year-long course that allows them to increase their 
 LATE *Testimony submitted late may not be considered by the Committee for decision making purposes. 

 
 
salaries by 50 percent at the end and provide higher-level support in our long-term care 
facilities. 
 
Healthcare employers have invested heavily in these programs by providing clinicians to teach 
courses, investing in hands-on training opportunities for high school students, and offering 
stipends to participants, particularly in the glidepath program, to ensure they are compensated 
as if working full-time. Our organization has also provided significant staffing resources to 
recruit students, coordinate programs, and secure federal, state, and private funding to keep 
everything running smoothly. Importantly, for this program, there is a plan to fully fund the 
programs privately at the end of two years. This funding is needed to continue the momentum 
of the programs while ensuring that a permanent funding source is established through 
healthcare employers and other relevant stakeholders. 
 
We also support the loan repayment program, which is crucial for attracting and retaining 
healthcare professionals in Hawaii. The high cost of living and significant educational debt are 
major barriers for healthcare workers who might otherwise choose to practice in the state. By 
continuing to fund loan repayment programs, the legislature can help incentivize professionals 
to work in underserved areas and ensure that critical healthcare needs are met statewide. 
Another essential provision in this bill is the proposal to make permanent the increase in 
reimbursements to professionals billing under Medicaid to 100% of the Medicare rate. 
Medicaid plays a critical role in providing health coverage for a significant portion of Hawaii’s 
population, including half of the children in the state. Since the COVID-19 pandemic began in 
2020, Medicaid enrollment has risen significantly, with nearly one-third of all residents now in 
the program, highlighting its importance in ensuring access to healthcare for those most in 
need. 
 
However, many Medicaid recipients continue to face challenges in obtaining timely and 
adequate care, particularly from specialists. One of the primary barriers to care is the shortage 
of healthcare providers, especially in rural areas. In 2022, Hawaii faced a shortage of more than 
750 full-time physicians and nearly 4,000 patient-facing healthcare professionals, with the 
shortage particularly pronounced among specialists. A key factor contributing to these gaps is 
the disparity in reimbursement rates between Medicaid and other payers, such as Medicare 
and private insurance. Lower Medicaid reimbursement rates have discouraged provider 
participation, limiting the number of specialists who accept Medicaid patients. This lack of 
participation results in restricted access to specialized services, delays in care, and worsening 
health outcomes for Medicaid recipients. 
 
The legislature’s 2023 decision to increase Medicaid reimbursement rates to 100% of Medicare 
rates has already made a significant impact, helping to cover the costs of care for providers, 
especially in rural areas, and ensuring that more residents receive timely and needed care. This 
step also brought nearly $85 million in federal funds to support healthcare access in the state. 
Making this increase permanent is critical to addressing healthcare inequities, encouraging 
provider participation, and sustaining access to care for Medicaid patients. 
 

 
 
Additionally, we strongly support making permanent the ceiling for the nursing and hospital 
sustainability programs. These programs have been instrumental in stabilizing funding for 
hospitals and nursing facilities, which are critical to delivering care to communities across 
Hawaii. By maintaining these programs, the state demonstrates its commitment to 
safeguarding the healthcare infrastructure that so many residents depend on. While this 
provision is brief in its language, its impact is substantial, ensuring that these facilities can 
continue to operate effectively and meet the growing demands of patient care. 
 
It is also important to acknowledge that potential changes to the provider tax program could 
lead to reductions in funding for nursing facilities in particular. These facilities provide essential 
care for some of Hawaii’s most vulnerable residents, and any decrease in funding would have 
significant consequences for access to long-term care. Ensuring stable funding for nursing 
facilities must remain a priority to avoid service disruptions and protect the quality of care for 
elderly and disabled individuals. We are working with our members and our national affiliates 
to track this issue and can provide updates to this committee if needed.  
 
In summary, these provisions are not merely budgetary decisions—they represent strategic 
investments in the health and well-being of our residents. Making Medicaid reimbursement 
increases permanent, supporting the nursing and hospital sustainability programs, and 
prioritizing workforce initiatives are all essential to strengthening Hawaii’s healthcare system. 
We respectfully urge you to support these measures and pass the budget bill with these critical 
components intact. Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony, and I am happy to 
answer any questions you may have.

RE: 
HB 300 RELATING TO THE STATE BUDGET 
 
Hearing Date – March 5, 2025, at 9 a.m. 
 
Aloha Chair Yamashita, Vice Chair Takenouchi and Members of the Committee, 
Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to submit testimony in support our budget appropriation 
requests set forth in HB 300 for the 2026 and 2027 fiscal years. Act 103, SLH 2015, codified as HRS 
Chapter 323F, Part IV ("Act 103") provides for operating and capital subsidies for Maui Health System 
("MHS") in connection with its operation of the hospitals. Under HRS §323F-58 and the terms of the 
Transfer Agreement signed January 14, 2016 between MHS and Hawai'i Health Systems Corporation, 
the State of Hawai'i, and the Maui Region of Hawai'i Health Systems Corporation (the "Transfer 
Agreement"), MHS may request operating support payments annually based upon the amounts needed 
to cover any operating losses of the Hospitals plus a 2% margin, but the amount requested in any year 
may not exceed the amount appropriated to subsidize the operating costs of the Maui Regional System 
for the 2014 fiscal year, which was $38 million. Under HRS §323F-59 MHS may also request support 
payments for its capital expenditures during the first ten (10) years of MHS' operations of the hospitals 
in an amount not less than $6 million. 
As you may be aware, I officially joined MHS as the Chief Executive Officer on January 1, 2024. I 
have worked closely with our team over the last year to understand the terms of the Transfer 
Agreement and the current financial position of Maui Health. I am honored to be here and serving the 
Maui and Lana’i communities. 
We are grateful for the support provided by the Governor and the State Legislature in sustaining the 
health care system on Maui and Lana'i. Since our public/private partnership began, we have reduced 
our total state funding by over $125 million. 
Unforeseen challenges, including the global pandemic, the devastating wildfires on Maui and two 
labor strikes, have impacted the speed of our progress. While our pace has been slowed, the goal 
remains to provide high quality, reliable and accessible health care on Maui and Lana’i without 
taxpayer support. 
Each year we care for over 50,000 patients in our emergency departments across central Maui, 
upcountry Kula, and Lana'i. In addition, Maui Health is the sole provider of inpatient psychiatric care 
on the island and absorbs the cost of those services. Despite progress, we face ongoing economic 
challenges and seek your continued support as we continue to move towards economic self-reliance 
and sustainability.

C:\Users\ckr\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\INetCache\Content.Outlook\E5UQKU8Z\2025-03-4 MHS Testimony - FIN (2023479.1).docx 
Our commitment extends to caring for over 100 kupuna in long-term care and skilled nursing in Kula 
and Lana'i, managing both hospitals at near full capacity. Our team continues to work with our 
community partners to reduce the number of kupuna waiting for access to long-term care or skilled 
nursing beds but continue to have over 25 patients living in the hospital, utilizing an acute care bed 
when they need long term care. On Maui, adequate long term care beds are available but remain 
empty, reportedly because there are not staff available to provide care. We absorb approximately $4 
million in costs while awaiting long-term care availability. 
Extended lengths of stay for individuals without a safe discharge plan increase the cost of care in 
Maui by $7 million per year. These patients include those who are houseless, have co-occurring 
substance use disorders, under treated mental illness, those needing an inpatient hospice bed, short 
term rehabilitation or those who simply need access to life saving antibiotic infusions that are 
unavailable in remote eastern Maui. 
Looking ahead to State Fiscal Year 2026, hospital reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid and 
Commercial Insurance companies is increasing by less than 3% while the cost of labor, medical 
supplies and drugs are forecasted to continue to outpace reimbursement. These facts require that we 
become more efficient to continue to progress toward our goal. 
While these challenges are substantial, we believe they are solvable with sustained effort, funding, 
and collaboration with other agencies. Maui Health is committed to doing our part in this ongoing work 
to solidify health care services for our community. Your continued support is appreciated as we 
navigate these challenges and strive for a sustainable and self-reliant health care model. 
Given the information noted above, Maui Health respectfully requests the state's assistance in 
continuing to provide care to the people of Maui and Lana’i by providing an operating subsidy of $12 
million for Fiscal Year 2026 and $6 million for Fiscal Year 2027. We appreciate your consideration 
and will be available to answer questions at your request. 
In kindness and appreciation, 
 
Lynn Fulton 
Chief Executive Officer

Comments for HB300 - Relating to the State Budget 
House Committee on Finance 
Wednesday, March 5, 2025 at 9:00AM Conf. Rm. 308 and via Videoconference 
 
Aloha Chair Yamashita, Vice Chair Takenouchi, and members of the committee:​
 
Mahalo for the opportunity to provide comments on HB300, relating to the State Budget, establishing 
funding allocations for the operating and capital improvement budgets. 
 
As a research and advocacy organization focused on economic justice, affordable housing, transportation 
equity, and food security, Hawai'i Appleseed understands that robust funding for state sponsored 
services and projects form the foundation of economic stability for our community. As our communities 
face significant challenges due to anticipated federal funding reductions, state-level financial support has 
become increasingly vital to protect our most vulnerable residents. Our research has consistently 
demonstrated that key programs that provide basic needs offer individuals and families a pathway to 
build economic self-sufficiency and increased community resilience. 
 
The impending federal funding cuts across various sectors are expected to adversely impact essential 
programs serving low to moderate income households. These reductions will create critical gaps in 
services that have provided stability and opportunities for advancement to thousands of families across 
our state. 
Affordable Housing 
Although it is difficult to estimate the exact fiscal impacts and cuts in funding we are expected to see 
under the current administration, we can anticipate a significant loss in federal financial support for 
affordable housing that will have devastating impacts in Hawaii.1 
Payment assistance through housing vouchers is a critical support for households in our communities. As 
the new Congress works to finalize 2025 appropriations bills, proposed budgets would effectively freeze 
funding at 2024 levels. 
Housing vouchers are tied to rental costs and require annual, inflation-related funding increases to 
maintain service levels. Consequently, flat funding acts as a de facto cut, reducing the number of people 
served. With the proposed appropriations, nearly 4,000 Hawaii residents would lose their housing 
assistance through cuts to Senior housing vouchers and Housing choice vouchers. This estimate does not

account for additional residents at risk of losing housing by not expanding the program or those at risk 
due to potential cuts to project-based vouchers currently being discussed.2 
The current administration's directives also include mandating 50% reduction in HUD workforce. 3 
Terminating HUD staff will significantly impede the state’s ability to access approved federal investments 
needed to address our housing challenges, with additional funding cuts anticipated for operating and 
repairing public housing and homelessness assistance programs.4 There is also a risk that the 
administration will return to past proposals of cutting funds to critical affordable housing development 
programs, such as the HOME program, Community Development Block Grant, and Choice 
Neighborhoods initiative.5 
With nearly 4,000 Hawaii residents potentially losing housing assistance, the state faces a potential 
significant increase in our existing housing crisis, widespread housing instability across communities, and 
a substantial risk of escalating homelessness. The economic implications of this are profound. The state’s 
current rate of 2500 annual evictions lead to $30 million in public costs. Each instance of temporary 
homelessness due to evictions incurs substantial state expenses, encompassing emergency shelter costs, 
increased medical service utilization, and potential impacts on juvenile correction programs. 
Preventative measures—such as developing affordable housing and expanding rent assistance—are 
demonstrably more cost-effective. Every $1 spent on rent assistance saves the public $6 on homeless 
services.6 
Despite the grim federal funding outlook, we commend the legislature for supporting substantial housing 
investments in the state budget. Priority areas should include: 
1.​ Developing income-restricted affordable housing through: 
○​ Rental Housing Revolving Fund (RHRF) 
○​ RHRF Tier 2 program 
2.​ Increasing housing supply for moderate-income households through:

​
We recognize that funding constraints are significant, but reducing investment at this time of uncertainty 
is not the appropriate solution. The proposed infusions to the Rental Housing Revolving Fund (RHRF) and 
Tier 2 programs—totaling $125 million for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027—represent a 
substantial decrease from previous years' allocations. We strongly urge the committee to maintain 
funding levels consistent with prior years, specifically recommending a total appropriation of $200 
million to ensure continued support for critical housing initiatives. 
Transportation 
A major share of the state’s annual CIP budget is allocated to transportation infrastructure through the 
Hawai‘i Department of Transportation (HDOT). For example, in FY25, the transportation CIP budget was 
around 59 percent of the total state CIP budget, representing nearly $2.6 billion of $4.4 billion in total

spending.7 The largest funding source for state transportation projects (included in the state’s CIP 
budgets from FY19 to FY24) was federal funding.8 From federal fiscal year (FFY) 22 to FFY 25, there were 
241 transportation projects to receive federal funding in Hawaiʻi.9  
As such, changes in federal transportation policy could have major impacts to the construction and 
maintenance of transportation infrastructure in Hawai‘i. While implementation details remain unclear, 
recent executive orders signal that the USDOT may cut funding (including obligated funding) for public 
transit, safety, electrification and other climate resilience projects. Based on recent analysis from the 
Transportation for America, $131,963,319 of federal transportation funds could be at risk of being 
cancelled in Hawai‘i due to new memos implementing President Trump’s executive orders.10 
While the funding of pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure is always important, it is even more pertinent 
now given the strong likelihood that the state will lose discretionary federal funding to support active 
transportation and safety projects. As such, we urge the state legislature to increase funding for the 
state’s safe route to school special (SRTS) program fund, which is one of the few state funding sources 
dedicated specifically to pedestrian and bike infrastructure. While we are happy to see a FY26 request 
for $13,048,180 for the SRTS program in the Governor’s Budget Request – this only covers unused 
program funds from previous fiscal years. Ideally we would like to see additional monies dedicated to the 
SRTS program to maximize resources for pedestrian safety projects near schools.   
Economic Justice 
The proposed budget resolution from Republicans in Congress includes massive cuts to Medicaid: it calls 
for $880 billion in Medicaid cuts through 2034. In comparison, Hawaiʻi spent around $3 billion on 
Medicaid in fiscal year 2023, and 73 percent of that was covered by federal funds. As a result, a 
significant reduction in this federal funding would have immediate, life-threatening consequences for the

Comments for HB300 - Relating to the State Budget

403,000 Hawaiʻi residents—almost a third of the state’s population—who are enrolled in Medicaid or 
CHIP.   
Although we do not know exactly how much of the state’s Medicaid funding would be at risk, it is clear 
that Hawaiʻi would have to raise substantial revenue to compensate for the loss in federal funding. 
Otherwise, Hawaiʻi may be forced to radically reduce its spending on Medicaid. At the extreme end, if 
Hawaiʻi decided to drop its Medicaid expansion entirely, 58,000 local recipients could lose their 
insurance coverage.11 For the sake of the thousands who depend on government-subsidized health 
coverage in Hawaiʻi, we urge the legislature to pass the funds that have already been dedicated to 
Medicaid/Med-Quest in House Bill 300. In the event that more funds are required to maintain the 
program at its current level, the state has a number of revenue options at its disposal. 
Food Equity 
The proposed federal cuts are as high as $230 billion for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program 
(SNAP), which is one of the most critical public benefit programs in the nation.12 These cuts could cause 
all 160,000 Hawaiʻi users to lose some or all benefits, increasing food insecurity among our most 
vulnerable populations.13 At the state level, because of the recent rule change to eliminate net income 
limits for eligibility, there is expected to be an extra 14,000 households eligible for SNAP benefits later 
this year.14 With large increases in SNAP applications upcoming, it is more urgent than ever to strengthen 
our social safety nets. 
In states across the nation, schools are already bracing for proposed cuts and restrictions, including one 
that would take away free meals from 52 participating Hawaiʻi schools and over 27,000 students.15 While

we are still unsure of how exactly CEP and Title I funding will look for our schools, it is essential that our 
state prioritize our keiki being fed. 
Collectively, these proposed budget cuts could lead to increased hardship for millions of Americans, 
particularly those in low- to moderate-income brackets. The reductions in housing assistance, healthcare 
coverage, and food support are expected to exacerbate existing economic inequities and hinder access 
to essential services 
Hawaiʻi Appleseed urges the state legislature to secure the future of vital services that promote 
economic justice and opportunity for all of Hawai'i's people.

Testimony of HPM Building Supply in Support  
 
Dear Chair Yamashita, Vice Chair Takenouchi, and Committee Members: 
  
I would like to submit this testimony in support of HB300, Relating to the State Budget. Specifically, I 
support the following budget items: 
 
1. $1,000,000 for FY 26 for the Department of Human Resources Development (DHRD) to 
conduct a civil service position classification and compensation study; 
2. Adds $338,150 for FY 26 and $1,343,400 for FY 27 for consultant services to maintain Tax 
System Modernization (TSM) projects; and  
3. Adds 6.00 permanent positions and $294,796 for FY 26 and 7.00 permanent positions and 
$664,592 for FY 27 for the Department of Taxation (DOTAX) to establish a Tax System 
Modernization Office and integrate the Internal Revenue Services' Direct File Project with TSM. 
  
HPM Building Supply is a 100% employee-owned company serving Hawaii's home improvement 
market and building industry for over 100 years since 1921. With 18 locations across Hawai‘i and 
Washington State, HPM offers various services and products, including retail stores, building supply 
and lumber yards, home design centers, drafting and design services, and manufacturing facilities. 
HPM is dedicated to enhancing homes, improving lives, and transforming communities.   
 
Ensuring our state remains affordable for working families requires bold action to strengthen economic 
security. Today, thousands of state government jobs remain vacant, leading to reduced services and 
economic instability for our communities. By investing in a study to modernize our civil servant position 
classification and compensation can improve recruitment and retention efforts, which will help connect 
residents with stable, middle-class careers that offer competitive wages, benefits, and long-term 
financial security. Filling these positions will also improve essential services that working families rely 
on, from education to public safety. 
 
Additionally, implementing a state-level Direct File system would ease the financial burden of tax 
preparation, allowing families to file their taxes for free instead of paying costly private services. This 
initiative would put more money back into the pockets of hardworking residents—money that can go 
toward rent, groceries, and childcare instead of tax prep fees. Together, these programs will create 
pathways to economic stability. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
 
 
Jason Fujimoto 
Chairman & CEO

Statement of 
Meli James and Brittany Heyd 
Cofounders 
Mana Up  
 
HB300, Relating to The State Budget 
 
Aloha Chair Yamashita, Vice Chair Takenouchi, and Committee Members, 
 
We support HB 300, The State Budget Bill. In particular, we support funding: 
 
1. A civil service position classification and compensation study; 
2. Consultant services to maintain Tax System Modernization (TSM) projects; and  
3. Positions to establish a Tax System Modernization Office and integrate the Internal Revenue 
Services' Direct File Project with TSM. 
 
Mana Up is a statewide initiative that helps provide entrepreneurs in Hawai‘i with the resources and tools 
to grow their business and scale globally. As these entrepreneurs continue to grow, they also help 
contribute to our expanding our local economy. As part of our mission, we aim to sustain the local 
economy through economic diversification, local job creation, community giveback, investment, and a 
regenerative culture of entrepreneurship – providing a better future for generations to come here in 
Hawai‘i.  
 
These items provide critical funding to help reduce vacancies in state government jobs and implements 
the IRS Direct File program at the state level.  Filling vacancies in state employment will improve essential 
public services, while Direct File will eliminate filing fees and maximize tax refunds for families who need 
them most. 
 
At a time when families are struggling with rising costs, these items offer both immediate and long-term 
relief. A well-staffed state workforce means more efficient public services, from healthcare to housing 
assistance, reducing bureaucratic delays that can create financial hardship. Meanwhile, implementing the 
Direct File program ensures that every dollar earned by working families stays in their pockets, rather 
than being spent on tax preparation fees. Investing in these programs makes economic sense and 
strengthens the financial security of families across our state. 
 
Sincerely,

POSITION:  
SUPPORT WITH COMMENTS 
 
Aloha e Chair Yamashita, Vice Chair Takenouchi, and members of the committee, 
 
On behalf of Hawai‘i Children’s Action Network Speaks!, I am writing to express strong support 
for critical investments in early learning opportunities for Hawai‘i’s keiki. Expanding access to 
high-quality early learning is one of the most effective ways to improve educational equity, 
support underserved families, and build a foundation for lifelong success. A comprehensive 
approach that includes both classroom expansion and programmatic funding is necessary to fulfill 
the state’s commitment to universal early learning. 
 
To achieve this, we urge your support for the following essential funding priorities: 
 
• Funding and positions to establish 50 additional Executive Office on Early Learning 
(EOEL) Public Prekindergarten classrooms over the next two years (EDN700): 
o Expands access to high-quality early learning, prioritizing enrollment for 
underserved keiki 
o Strengthens efforts to achieve universal early learning for three- and four-year-
olds 
o Enhances Kindergarten readiness and long-term academic success 
 
• Funding for Family Child Interaction Learning (FCIL) Program contracts (EDN 700): 
o Broadens early learning opportunities to meet the diverse needs of working 
families 
o Emphasizes a multi-generational, culturally responsive approach to early learning 
o Empowers families to play an active role in their children’s cognitive, social, and 
emotional development 
o Provides essential parent education alongside early learning experiences

• Additional funding for the Hawai‘i School Facilities Authority (SFA) to continue 
Prekindergarten classroom development and construction: 
o Address the urgent need for affordable, high-quality early learning opportunities 
for more than 8,000 underserved keiki 
o Builds on the SFA’s recent progress in completing 56 prekindergarten classrooms, 
creating over 1,000 new preschool seats 
o Ensures that the expansion of prekindergarten seats continues without delay by 
closing a $60 million funding gap 
o Prevents at least a two-year delay in seven major preschool projects that would 
impact more than 600 keiki 
 
These interconnected investments will expand access to early learning opportunities across 
Hawai‘i, ensuring that keiki enter school prepared to succeed. Without continued funding, we 
risk delaying critical progress toward universal preschool access, leaving thousands of our keiki 
without the necessary foundational education.  
 
For these reasons, I respectfully urge you to include this funding in the House Draft of the budget. 
Mahalo for the opportunity to provide testimony and for your consideration in supporting early 
learning opportunities for Hawai‘i’s keiki and families.

Re: 
Testimony of the ACLU of Hawai‘i offering COMMENTS 
on HB300 Relating to the State Budget  
 
Dear Chair Yamashita, Vice Chair Takenouchi, and Members of the Committee: 
The ACLU of Hawaiʻi offers comments on HB300, which appropriates funds for the 
operating and capital improvement budget of the Executive Branch for the biennium.  
 
The ACLU of Hawai’i believes the budget reflects our collective values and priorities. As 
such, we strongly oppose provisions included in the bill funding the planning, 
development, and construction of a new jail facility in Halawa. The price tag for this 
new jail is currently estimated at over $1 billion. 
 
HB300 proposes to grossly expand the current carceral system at a time when the state 
may be facing significant funding shortfalls because of the new federal administration. It 
is short-sighted to continue funding a project that is unnecessary.  
 
Currently, nearly 70% of the population at the Oahu Community Correctional Center 
(OCCC) is “pre-trial.” This means, simply, that they have not been convicted yet of any 
crime. What’s more, a report recently published by the Prison Policy Initative (PPI), 
highlighted that “[p]eople incarcerated at OCCC are overwhelmingly there for low-
level, non-violent charges, including technical violations of probation conditions, 
and there are a wealth of opportunities to decrease Hawaii's jail population to the 
point where new jail construction may not be necessary.”1  
 
The State currently spends more than $90,000 per year for each and every incarcerated 
adult, while spending less than $10,000 per year on to educate a keiki in our public 
schools. This imbalance does not reflect our values nor our priorities. 
 
Among the appropriations to which we strongly object is $30 million to the Department 
of Corrections and Rehabilitation (DCR) for “[p]lans, land aquisition, design, and 
construction for the project management support and financial participation by the State 
of Hawaii to fund and construct the new [OCCC]...” While DCR continues to oppose any 
meaningful reforms to reduce the jail population, we believe this cost is both premature 
and unnecessary. 
 
Further, the bill appropriates an additional $10 million to DCR for numerous planning 
projects, including a new 10-year master plan. We believe all funds for a new OCCC

should not be appropritated, at a minimum, until DCR has completed its 10-year master 
plan. The “current” plan was completed more than 20 years ago. 
 
It is also unclear why these various planning projects have a $10 million price tag, which 
is just one reason why we are calling for a forensic audit of DCR and the Department of 
Accounting and General Services (DAGS). DCR has already expended more than 
$20 million on the new jail project with nothing to show for it, expect receipts from 
consultants and public-relations firms. 
 
Criminal justice reforms have proven successful in other states by significantly 
reducing the pretrial population by 30-50% and the total number of incarcerated 
people, without compromising public safety and while saving taxpayer dollars. 
Eliminating our cash bail system or reforming it – is one way of diverting people from 
incarceration by 20-50%, as demonstrated in other states. 
 
Before the State spends another penny on planning and constructing an expanded bed 
capacity jail, we must pause.  The State should carefully review Prison Policy Initiative’s 
latest report with specific recommendations to OCCC and await the findings of the 10-
year master before issuing an RFI and RFP.  We must take more aggressive steps 
toward real criminal justice reforms, including bail reform. And we must adjust our 
spending to prioritize truly affordable housing solutions, health care, mental health 
treatment, education, youth afterschool programs and work force development.  
 
We urge the committee to amend HB300 to reflect our collective values and build safe, 
healthy, thriving, and equitable communities.

Comments:  
Aloha Members of the Committee, 
My name is Christina Libby, I am a business owner, mother, and Board Certified Behavior 
Analyst. I am writing to express my strong support for HB300, which would ensure the 
permanency of increased QUEST rates for Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) services for 
children with autism. These rate increases have been vital in ensuring that children receive the 
crucial healthcare treatment they need. 
The increased rates have made it possible to retain qualified providers, expand access to essential 
ABA services, and reduce waitlists for children who rely on these therapies for meaningful 
progress. Without these rates, families face increased barriers to care, and providers struggle to 
sustain services. If HB300 is not passed, the rates will revert in 2026, creating significant 
disruptions in care for some of our most vulnerable children. 
I respectfully urge your continued support with the Finance Committee to ensure that the funds 
allocated for making these rate increases permanent remain in the budget bill. This is our one 
opportunity to secure the future of ABA services for children in need, and I hope we can see this 
through to the finish line together. Thank you for your time and commitment to this critical 
issue.  
Respectfully,  
Christina Libby, M.S., BCBA, LBA

Please maintain the current 2025 provided Medicaid rates to support children with autism. This 
action does not increase the budget from year to year and reaps the benefits of the rate study that 
was completed in 2024. It helps increase wages for local employees while supporting a 
vulnerable population. This is a win win with no increased financial impact from 2025 to 2026 
and beyond.

As a provider of ABA services here in Hawaii, I am submitting written testimony in 
strong support of maintaining QUEST ABA rate increases in the budget to help children with 
autism. While the rate increases for 2025 provide significant support for provider organizations 
to continue to providing medically necessary ABA services, it would only be a temporary relief 
if rates decrease back to previous rates in 2026.

Aloha, practicing ABA in the Aloha State is a privilege made possible by the rates presently 
afforded to providers. Even with rates as they are, retention is already difficult for certain roles, 
such as with RBTs. Ensuring rates do not decline will at least ensure that ABA services needed 
as they are by so many in our state remain extant, and do not go extinct. Thank you to all who 
are able to consider voting in favor of allocating funds for Quest ABA services such that these 
temporary rates become permanent, so that children with autism diagnoses may keep the medical 
services that they deserve.

Aloha Chair, Vice Chair, and Members of the Committee, 
I am writing to express my strong support for the inclusion of funds in HB300 to maintain the 
QUEST Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) rate increases. These rates are critical to ensuring 
children with autism in Hawai‘i continue to receive the quality care and therapeutic services they 
need to thrive. 
ABA services play a vital role in helping children with autism develop essential communication, 
social, and adaptive skills. Maintaining adequate reimbursement rates allows providers to sustain 
high-quality programs, retain qualified professionals, and ensure that services are accessible to 
families who rely on QUEST coverage. Without this funding, families across Hawai‘i could face 
service reductions, long waitlists, or complete loss of access to care — further widening the gap 
in essential services for some of our most vulnerable keiki. 
I urge you to support this funding to protect access to life-changing services for children with 
autism in Hawai‘i and to ensure that providers can continue to meet the needs of our 
communities. 
Mahalo for your time and consideration, and for your commitment to supporting the well-being 
of children and families across our state. 
Respectfully, 
Kaitlin Preciado

FROM:   Ann S. Yabusaki, Ph.D. 
RE: 
HB300 
 
 
I am writing to advocate for an increased budget for the Developmental Disabilities 
Council to at least $1M.  They work to find and create support for individuals and families 
affected by developmental disabilities.   
 
I work with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FAS), neurodevelopmental disabilities 
associated with prenatal alcohol exposure.  There are few if any services for people and their 
families impacted by FASD.   
 
Working with the Council to address the needs, including awareness of the prevalence 
of these disorders, has been a blessing.  As a volunteer and psychologist finding the proper 
support has been difficult.  Many of my clients drop out of school or are expelled, must enter 
residential programs off-island because of the lack of resources, and those who are 
incarcerated lack the support to remain out of the criminal justice system. 
 
I strong urge you to increase substantial support for the DD Council (HTH 905, p. 414) 
and for individuals with developmental disabilities (HTH 501, p. 378).

Aloha Chair Yamashita, Vice Chair Takenouchi, and Committee Members:  
 My name is Eileen Keane Hurtt and I live in Kailua. I'm a high school teacher, have two school-
age children, and have been living on Oahu since 2008. I’m testifying in opposition to provisions 
in HB300 that expand mass incarceration and the building of a new $1 billion super jail. 
I am absolutely against HB300. Budgets reveal what and who we care about. For example, 
instead of focusing on helping people get off the streets, we put barriers on benches and 
medieval-looking stones or spikes in places where the weary may try to rest. What does this 
illumate about our community? The proposed budget includes an appropriation for the building 
of a new OCCC, but we don’t need a new, $1 billion jail. Instead, we need to fund youth and 
education programs, affordable housing, job training, family strengthening and violence 
interruption programs, community-based health, treatment and reintegration programs rooted in 
evidence-based practices, and restorative justice to help us build communities that are safe, 
healthy, and equitable. Instead of the $1 billion jail, we should focus on programs within the 
existing correctional facilities and in our communities to reduce crime, provide job skills, 
encourage community service, educate against drug use, and education programs for those who 
are incarcerated.  
 Please consider putting out monies toward youth education programs that keep people out of jail 
in the first place, and programs that help those who are incarcerated gain skills (job and social) 
and tools (mental health, recovery, etc.) to rejoin society as healthy, contributing members. Let's 
put our tax dollars into programs/projects that help communities thrive.  
Mahalo for your time and consideration,

Aloha, 
My name is Luanna Peterson and I live in Niu Valley. I am testifying in strong opposition to the 
provisions in HB300that expand mass incarceration and allocate funding for the construction of 
a $1 billion super jail. 
I come to this issue not only as a community organizer, educator, and advocate for justice, but 
also as someone who has personally experienced the harms of our incarceration system. I come 
from a family where every male relative has been brutalized by police, incarcerated, or struggled 
with addiction and trauma—not because they were inherently dangerous, but because they were 
caught in a system designed to criminalize poverty, mental health struggles, and survival. I, too, 
was incarcerated as a youth. And I know firsthand that locking people away does not make us 
safer—investing in our communities does. 
Budgets reveal what and who we care about. Instead of spending $1 billion on a new OCCC, we 
need to invest in youth and education programs, permanent supportive housing, job training, 
family strengthening initiatives, community-based healthcare, treatment and reintegration 
programs, and restorative justice approaches—all of which have been proven to reduce harm and 
create real safety. We cannot continue to pour money into cages while refusing to address the 
root causes of incarceration. 
I urge you to reject this appropriation and instead prioritize evidence-based, community-driven 
solutions that foster true safety, healing, and equity for Hawaiʻi’s people. 
Mahalo for your time and consideration, 
Luanna Peterson

My name is Lewis Glenn and I live in Kailua Town.  I’m testifying in opposition to provisions 
in HB300 that expand mass incarceration and the building of a new $1 billion super jail. 
Budgets reveal what and who we care about. Do we care more for a new billion-dollar jail than 
we do for the people of our great state?  Is a billion-dollar jail the easy "fix" for our neglect for 
our neighbors?  Does the jail address root causes of crime, or merely put the unfortunate and 
underserved away from sight so that we can get on with "business as usual"? The proposed 
budget includes an appropriation for the building of a new OCCC, but we don’t need a new, $1 
billion jail. Instead, we need to fund youth and education programs, affordable housing, job 
training, family strengthening and violence interruption programs, community-based health, 
treatment and reintegration programs rooted in evidence-based practices, and restorative justice

Please, let's get this right.  Hawaii is smarter and more compassionate than this.

My name is Pam Elders . I live in Laupahoehoe on Hawaii Island. I’m writing to express my 
opposition to provisions in HB300 that expand mass incarceration and the building of a new $1 
billion super jail. 
The proposed budget includes an appropriation for the building of a new OCCC, however, it is 
my firm belief that a new, $1 billion jail is not needed. Instead, we need to invest in youth and 
education programs, affordable housing, job training, family strengthening and violence 
interruption programs, community-based health, treatment and reintegration programs rooted in 
evidence-based practices, and restorative justice to help us build communities that are safe, 
healthy, and equitable. 
My career in education has shown me that prevention is the best investment for long-term 
sustainability.

Support of Bill HB1431 HD1 (HSCR793): Relating to Oral Health/Oral Health Task Force  
I am writing in support of HB300 which includes requested funds to re-establish the state’s DOH Oral 
Health Program. As an oral health professional, I support all efforts that can support and improve the 
oral health of community members. This bill can serve to augment and complement support of HB1431 
HD1 (HSCR793) establishing an Oral Health Task Force.  
I am grateful and was very supportive of the 2022 effort to reinstate Medicaid Adult Dental Health 
benefits in Hawaii.  As Hawaii continues to grow in supporting access for dental care, we have also 
learned there is much more to be done.  Hawaii will benefit with a coordinated approach to the complex 
issues surrounding unmet oral health needs in Hawaii.

My name is Katlyn Vogl and I live in Honolulu, Hawaiʻi. I’m testifying in opposition to 
provisions in HB300 that expand mass incarceration and the building of a new $1 billion 
super jail. 
Where we decide to allocate money is evidence of our morals as a community. The 
proposed budget includes an appropriation for the building of a new OCCC, but we don’t 
need a new, $1 billion jail. There are so many programs that need that money so much 
more. The last thing we need to do is expand the prison industrial complex, which operates 
on racist values, and disproportionately incarcerates Kānaka Maoli. Instead, we need to 
fund youth and education programs, affordable housing, job training, family strengthening 
and violence interruption programs, community-based health, treatment and reintegration 
programs rooted in indigenous and evidence-based practices, and restorative justice to help 
us build communities that are safe, healthy, and equitable.

My name is Dianne Deauna and I live in Mānoa. I’m testifying in opposition to provisions in 
HB300 that expand mass incarceration and the building of a new $1 billion super jail. 
Budgets reveal what and who we care about. The proposed budget includes an appropriation for 
the building of a new O'ahu Community Correctional Center, but we don’t need a new $1 billion 
jail.  
Hawai’i is not safe when many people struggle to meet their basic needs—many face 
homelessness, low wages coupled with a high cost of living, and a lack of access to the diversion 
infrastructure and critical mental health services they need. Hawai’i is not safe when billion-
dollar jail expansion projects are prioritized over access to healthy foods, decent jobs, and safe 
and stable housing. 
This current version of the State budget bill would appropriate $30 MILLION for planning 
relating to the proposed new jail to replace OCCC, $10 MILLION for a 10-year Department of 
Corrections Statewide Master Plan, and MILLIONS more for jail and prison expansion and 
maintenance. What’s more, the State is pushing for a Public-Private-Partnership (P3) to 
finance, design, construct, and maintain the new jail. This will make taxpayers poorer, not 
safer!  
Instead, we need to fund youth and education programs, affordable housing, job training, family 
strengthening and violence interruption programs, community-based health, treatment and 
reintegration programs rooted in evidence-based practices, and restorative justice to help us build 
communities that are safe, healthy, and equitable. 
I fully support ACLU Hawai'i's opposition to this bill, in the name of reimagining public safety. 
Mahalo for your time and consideration.

My name is Elizabeth Winternitz, and I live in Kula, Maui. I’m testifying in deep opposition to 
provisions in HB300 that would commit significant resources towards constructing a new $1 
billion jail. 
Nearly a decade ago, House Concurrent Resolution No. 85, H.D.2, S.D.1 (2016) requested the 
Chief Justice of the Supreme Court make recommendations to the legislature on ways to improve 
Hawaii’s correctional system. The primary recommendation in response to that request was: 
“[T]hat Hawaii immediately begin to transition from a punitive to a rehabilitative correctional 
system. Evidence from other states and countries confirms that the rehabilitative approach is the 
only sustainable way to make our community safe mass incarceration does not work.” (Final 
Report of the House Concurrent Resolution 85 Task Force on Prison Reform to the Hawaii 
Legislature Regular Session, 2019) 
The intervening decade has proven the prescience of this recommendation; yet, as written, HB 
300 continues to support significant expenditures to expand mass incarceration. 
I respectfully request members of the Committee reject any version of a State budget that fails so 
grievously to align with Hawai'i State values of mutual caring, and respect for our common 
existence. 
Please invest our tax dollars in programs like youth and education programs, affordable housing, 
job training, family strengthening and violence interruption programs, community-based health, 
treatment and reintegration programs rooted in evidence-based practices, and restorative justice 
to help us build communities that are safe, healthy, and equitable.  
Mahalo for your time and consideration.

My name is Colleen Rost-Banik and I live in Honolulu. I'm also a Sociology Instructor at the 
University of Hawaii, Manoa. I’m testifying in opposition to provisions in HB300 that expand 
mass incarceration by building a new $1 billion super jail. 
I have taught in the Women's Community Correctional Center for the past seven years and have 
heard many stories about OCCC. Even though OCCC is overcrowded, as you know, the entire 
female population formerly housed at OCCC, has now moved to WCCC. Further, roughly 30% 
of people at OCCC were houseless upon entry. Significant numbers of people at OCCC are also 
struggling with mental health issues and substance addiction. 
Suffice it to say that not only does OCCC not need to house nearly as many people as are 
currently there, but moreso, it definitely does not need ot house as many people as the  expansion 
has planned for. Rather, we need to fund youth and education programs, affordable housing, job 
training, family strengthening and violence interruption programs, community-based health, 
treatment and reintegration programs rooted in evidence-based practices, and restorative justice 
to help us build communities that are safe, healthy, and equitable. We don't need to fund $1 
billion jail. 
Budgets reflect our values and priorities. Please join me in prioritizing people's basic needs, not 
in expanding incarceration.

Dear Representative Yamashita and members of the House Finance Committee,  
I am a resident in the State of Hawaii and I am writing to your to provide my written testimony 
in support of HB300 that outlines the allocation of funds for the upcoming years.  
I think that the bill is critical in the funding of our future and decides the future of key state 
programs, infrastructure, and essential public services. I strongly support this bill because it 
ensures that there is a continued investment in the people of Hawaii with these budgets being 
allocated into educational programs, healthcare, afforable housing and more. It is vital that we 
maintain an adequate budget for these programs because it helps to keep "Hawaiian Lands in 
Hawaiian Hands," not only now but it influences future generations too. If we want to better our 
communities it is essential to invest in them and give them resources and tools they need to 
succeed. It is key to maintain a budget that benefits the residents of Hawaii to cultivate a better 
Hawaii.  
Thank you for your time and consideration. I appreciate the opportunity to submit testimony on 
HB300, and I respectfully urge that this bill be passed not only to benefit the now but also the 
future of Hawaii.

Budgets reveal our priorities—what and who we truly care about. The proposed budget includes

need to invest in the well-being of our communities by prioritizing funding for youth and

Evidence-based restorative justice approaches provide a far more effective path toward building 
safe, healthy, and equitable communities.

Hello! 
As an ABA provider serving primarily Medicaid families in Hawaii, the temporary rates from 
2025 have been SO necessary for us to provide a competitive wage to behavior technicians 
caring for vulnerable children and families. I fully support maintaining the QUEST rates for 
ABA services. Doing so will enable us, and other providers, to support Medicaid families in 
receiving medically necessary services. Returning rates to their lower level before will make it 
incredibly challenging to hire and maintain staff. Please support this bill!

To Whom This May Concern, 
 
With over 10 years of experience in the administrative side of the ABA field, working with three 
different ABA providers, I have been honored to witness the systemic changes that support and 
increase access to care for individuals affected by ASD. Bills like this one are critical in 
supporting providers to ensure the delivery of quality care. Adequate reimbursement rates are 
essential for sustaining operations, allowing providers to stay in business, pay staff competitive 
living wages, and ensure that providers feel valued. This, in turn, helps businesses stay open and 
continue to serve the community. The increase in rates has been pivotal in allowing us to expand 
our services and better support the families who rely on us.

Comments:  
am writing to express my strong support for HB300, which seeks to make the increased Med-
QUEST reimbursement rates for Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) services permanent. As a 
[your role, e.g., "Director of Talent Acquisition in the ABA field"/"concerned 
professional"/"parent of a child receiving ABA services"], I have witnessed firsthand the critical 
impact of ABA therapy on individuals with autism and other developmental disabilities. 
Ensuring adequate reimbursement rates is essential to maintaining access to these vital services 
for Hawai‘i’s most vulnerable populations. 
Since the increase in Med-QUEST ABA reimbursement rates, providers have been able to retain 
qualified professionals, reduce waitlists, and expand services to underserved communities. 
However, if this rate increase is not made permanent, we risk reversing this progress, leading to 
staffing shortages, increased provider attrition, and reduced access to care. The reality is that 
lower reimbursement rates will make it financially unsustainable for many ABA providers to 
continue serving Med-QUEST members, forcing families to either seek private services—if they 
can afford them—or go without necessary therapy. 
Hawai‘i already faces significant challenges in recruiting and retaining Registered Behavior 
Technicians (RBTs) and Board Certified Behavior Analysts (BCBAs) due to the high cost of 
living and competition from other states with better reimbursement rates. Without competitive 
pay, we will continue to see high turnover, which disrupts continuity of care and negatively 
impacts patient outcomes. 
HB300 is not just about numbers—it’s about ensuring children and adults with autism and 
developmental disabilities receive the support they need to thrive. It is about making sure 
families do not face the devastating reality of losing access to essential therapy because providers 
can no longer afford to operate under unsustainable reimbursement models. 
I urge this committee to pass HB300 and ensure that Hawai‘i remains committed to supporting 
individuals with disabilities by maintaining adequate reimbursement rates for ABA providers. 
Thank you for your time and consideration. 
Sincerely, 
Niki Pollack

I am in STRONG OPPOSITION to HB300 as it does not focus on those community based 
services and housing options that are lacking in our state. Please do not invest in a billion dollar 
super jail that will divert much needed funds from the community. 
We need mental health services and supported housing options at all levels, low cost sober living 
homes, youth programs, and so much more. 
Again, please do not divert funds and focus away from what our community needs right now. 
Oppose HB300. 
Thank you.

RE: HB 300 
HEARING: Wednesday, March 5, 2025 
TIME: 9:00 a.m.  
ROOM: Conf. Room 308 and via video conference  
POSITION: Comment on funding for jail planning 
  
Chair Yamashita, Vice Chair Takenouchi, and members of the committee: 
In 2018, the HCR 85 Task Force on Prison reform warned the Legislature that building a 
new jail without addressing the factors driving up the jail population and keeping our recidivism 
rate above 50% was short sighed and a waste of money: 
Building new jails and prisons without fundamentally changing our 
approach to corrections would be short-sighted and a waste of money. The 
current system has been producing consistently poor outcomes for at least 40 
years, and it will continue to do so even with new facilities because the problem is 
not the facilities—bad as they may be—but our belief that locking people up 
under harsh conditions for long periods of time will make them better citizens. 
Until we recognize that our approach is wrong, our correctional outcomes will not 
improve and our communities will not be safer. What Hawai‘i needs at this 
critical juncture are to transition to a much more effective and sustainable 
correctional model that focuses on rehabilitation rather than punishment, and to 
adopt a strategic plan that addresses the many factors that are driving mass 
incarceration and keeping our recidivism rate above 50%.  
 
Before committing to the size, design, or location of a new jail, or any system, the 
State—working in a truly collaborative manner with stakeholders and the 
public—should focus on expanding programs that divert low-level offenders 
away from the criminal justice system, enact bail reform to reduce the number of 
pretrial detainees in the jail, create forensic treatment facilities for offenders who 
are mentally ill, expand community-based programs as an alternative to jail for 
misdemeanants, house HOPE Probation violators in community-based housing 
instead of jail, and reserve jail for the small number of individuals who are a flight 
risk and/or a danger to society.1

Task Force on Prison Reform to the Hawaii Legislature, 2019 Regular Session,”  December, 2018, pp. 62-
63. 
 

 
 
I apologize for the lengthy quotation, but the conclusion the Task Force reached, 
after two years of hard work studying Hawaii’s correctional system, is one of the most 
important pieces of advice Hawaii’s legislators have ever received with regard to criminal 
justice reform, and it has been totally ignored, which is why you now have before you a 
request for an additional $30 million to build a $1 billion jail that, as the Task Force said, 
will do nothing more than repackage all of the bad ideas of the old jail, and “create bad 
outcomes for the next half century or more.”2 
 
 
Worse yet, the plan is for the new jail to be acquired through a public private 
partnership, which means that it will likely be owned and maintained by a company with 
headquarters thousands of miles away, and whose employees do not live or work in 
Hawaii. And while the Department of Accounting and General Services (DAGS) has 
tried to put a positive spin on a privately owned jail (the only one in the country?) the one 
thing it has never discussed is the most important: How much will the lease rent be 
initially, what will it be over the life span of the jail, and can we afford the rent? And 
this begs the question: why is the administration asking for $30 million to plan a jail that 
we probably cannot afford.  
 
If the Legislature’s goal is to ultimately spend $1,000,000,000 of taxpayer money 
on a jail that is owned by private corporation and to lock the State into a 30 or 40-year 
lease for a jail we probably can’t afford, then by all means approve the $30 million in the 
budget for jail planning. 
 
  
But if the goal is to build a jail that we can afford, and that will make us safer and reduce 
recidivism, then you should follow the advice of the HCR 85 Task Force and plan a smaller and 
smarter jail.3 The recently issued report of the University of Hawaii Community Design Center 
(UHCDC) provides a roadmap for a better jail, and the State plan a jail that aligns with the 
UHCDC concepts and vision and is owned and operated by the State. Until there is a 
commitment to reducing the jail population and building a smaller jail, there should be no further 
appropriations for jail planning.  
 
 
Thank you for allowing me to testify on this matter.

As a Maui constituent, I am writing in support of the DHS budget appropriation for maintaining 
the QUEST rates for applied behavior analysis (ABA). I work with families with special health 
needs and have seen the positive impact access to ABA services has on children and their 
families, but unfortunately, have also seen the impact of provider shortages and the often long 
wait for QUEST families to be able to access care. 
I respectfully request you maintain these funds in the budget bill.

My name is  Sara Dinkelo and I am a board certified behvior analyst. I've been practicing as a 
behavior analyst for almost 10 years and I have been supporting individuals with developmental 
disabilities for well over 20. 
 
I am writing today in strong support of HB300. Specifically, I support ensuring the security for 
ABA services for children with autism by keeping the current funds allocated for QUEST ABA 
services in Hawaii. I am strong support of making the QUEST ABA rates permenent to ensure 
the sustainability of needed services.  
Throughout my career I have seen the impacts of low reinbursement rates on agencies who are 
trying to provided needed ABA services across the islands. Local companies are struggling 
because of continued difficulties with our funders. As a result we see more and more companies 
coming in from the continent who don't understand the culture here in Hawaii. Securing these 
rates will give local companies a fighting chance to continue to provide supports to families and 
individuals who need it most who are impacted by Autism or other developmental disorders. 
Mahalo for you time and for your continued work to support our communities.

RE: In Opposition to HB300 
  
Dear Chair Yamashita, Vice Chair Takenouchi, and members of the Committee, 
  
My name is Scott Nishimoto, and I’m the Co-Executive Director of Ceeds of Peace – a local 
nonprofit organization whose mission is to raise peacebuilding leaders. I’m testifying in 
opposition to provisions in HB300 that expand mass incarceration and the building of a 
new $1 billion super jail. 
  
Specifically, I am concerned about the current budget bill’s appropriation of $30 million 
for planning related to the proposed new jail to replace OCCC and $10 million for a 10-
year Department of Corrections Statewide Master Plan.  
  
 LATE *Testimony submitted late may not be considered by the Committee for decision making purposes. 

It is irresponsible to allocate this kind of money to “planning” for a prison expansion in a 
year in which we are facing unprecedented threats to public education and so many other 
services for vulnerable populations. Doing so, while also failing to fund important 
initiatives like HB754 (Community Schools) and HB757 (Universal School Lunch), would 
reveal that our state is choosing to prioritize mass incarceration over our most vulnerable 
keiki. 
  
Currently, 40% of all people in jail in Hawai’i are houseless. Over 50% are Native 
Hawaiian and Pacific Islander. It is clear to us that this would not be the case, and we 
would not need more prison beds, if we were to simply divest in the carceral system and 
instead make historic investments in the continuum of care – public education, supportive 
housing, and mental health care, just to name a few. 
  
Please pass a budget that prioritizes the safety and well-being of our entire community. We 
are opposing HB300 because it fails to do so. 
  
Sincerely,  
Scott Nishimoto 
Co-Executive Director, Ceeds of Peace

RE: Public Comment re: HB 300 
Dear Chair Yamashita, 
I appreciate the opportunity to submit comments on HB 300 and the critical need to invest in 
reproductive health and family planning services, aligning with Governor Green’s proposed 
budget. 
As a health care provider working directly with patients in our community, I have seen firsthand 
the impact of Title X family planning funds, which were reintroduced in Hawai‘i in 2022 
through a partnership with Essential Access Health.  
Family planning services provide patients with a full range of birth control options, STI testing 
and treatment, pregnancy testing and options counseling, and cancer screenings. Title X funding 
is essential in supporting over 30 health care sites across the state, strengthening the healthcare 
workforce, ensuring same-day contraceptive care, and delivering essential health education. 
The health center I work for provided family planning to over 4,000 unique patients thanks to 
Title X funding. This included over 7,000 STI tests and contraceptive care for over 3,700 
patients. The consequences of reduced funding would be devastating for those who rely on these 
essential services. We would see an overwhelming surge in STI transmission rates and 
unplanned pregnancies. 
With ongoing threats to the Title X program, state funding is critical to supplement federal 
dollars and safeguard these essential services. 
Despite Hawai‘i’s strong commitment to expanding access to care, additional action and funding 
are urgently needed to ensure that all residents can obtain the reproductive health services they 
need. While federal funding has helped rebuild family planning programs, it is not enough to 
fully meet the demand. With ongoing threats to the Title X program, state funding is critical to 
supplement federal dollars and safeguard these essential services. 
Thank you for considering this testimony.

HB 300 – RELATING TO THE STATE BUDGET 
Chair Yamashita, Vice Chair Takenouchi, and members of Finance Committee: 
I currently serve as the Dean of the College of Engineering at the University of Hawaiʻi 
at Mānoa; however, submitting this testimony in my individual capacity. 
 
Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments and to make a request for 
consideration in HB 300. We are requesting for an extension of funds for the University 
of Hawaiʻi to develop wildfire susceptibility and vulnerability maps for the State of 
Hawai‘i.  
 
We received funds from the State Legislature in fiscal year 2024-2025 to generate 
wildfire susceptibility and vulnerability maps. However, the funds were released to the 
University of Hawai‘i with only a 6-month duration remaining in the fiscal year and thus 
will not be able to fully utilize the appropriation and complete this project on time. We 
request an extension of the lapse date for these funds for this project and re-
appropriation for the fiscal year 2025-2026. 
 
Wildfire susceptibility and vulnerability maps 1) help identify areas that are more 
susceptible to wildfire hazard, 2) allow decision-makers to prioritize high-risk areas for 
targeted risk reduction strategies, and  3) assist in the development of adaptation 
policies that lessen the disastrous impacts of future wildfires. Decision-makers can use 
wildfire vulnerability maps to guide zoning regulations to reduce the impact of wildfires 
on communities. Moreover, authorities will be more informed about policies allowing 
construction in vulnerable areas and locating essential facilities (e.g., hospitals, schools, 
and firefighting stations) in areas that are less vulnerable to wildfires.  
 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify on this measure.

As an Ob/Gyn physician, I personally have to take care of pregnant patients who are as young as 
14. I can testify that delivering a baby at age 14-18 carries serious consequences for a teenage 
girl. It often results in the teen not completing her self identified goals of finishing high school, 
attending college, apprenticeship, starting work, living independantly, achieving financial 
security. Teen pregnancies cause alot of the stress in the relationship and most don't survive, 
resulting in single mom teen households. Free, same day contraception is a highly effective 
strategy to reduce teen pregnancies. Title X supports this strategy in our community.

My name is Patrick Uchigakiuchi, and I live in Honolulu, Hawaii. I am testifying in opposition 
to provisions in HB300 that expand mass incarceration and the building of a new $1 billion super 
jail. 
  
We don’t need a new, $1 billion jail. Hawai’i can create true safety for all by more accurately 
meeting the needs of the many individuals currently overcrowding our jails. This involves 
greater emphasis on the Judiciary and community-based diversion programs and ensuring 
sufficient funding to our presently under-funded community-based social services and 
health/mental health care programs. More specifically, research clearly shows that we can reduce 
the need for bigger jails by providing affordable housing, job training, family strengthening and 
violence interruption programs, community-based health, treatment and reintegration programs 
rooted in evidence-based practices, including restorative justice and culture-based programs that 
strengthen personal, family, and community well-being to help us build communities that are 
safe, healthy, and equitable. This also includes prevention and early intervention programs to 
prevent vulnerable youth and families from becoming impacted by social determinants that 
increase their vulnerability to involvement in our criminal justice system. 
  
Mahalo for your time and consideration. 
Sincerely, 
Patrick Uchigakiuchi

Aloha Chair Yamashita, 
 I appreciate the opportunity to submit testimony in favor of HB300 and express the vital 
need  to  invest in family planning and reproductive health as it aligns with Governor Green's 
proposal budget.  I work in a health care setting and directly with patients in our diverse 
community. I have witnessed the positive impact that Title X family planning funding, which 
was  introduced in partnership with EHA (Essential Access Health) The health center that I work 
at has been able provide family planning services to almost 5000 patients as a result of Title X 
funding. With the possibility of the loss of Title X funding, state funding is crucial in ensuring 
that these essential services are available to those who need it most. 
I  appreciate your consideration of this testimony. 
With sincere respect, 
Carla Blevins

Dear Chair Yamashita, 
I would like to emphasize the critical need to invest in reproductive health and family planning 
services, aligning with Governor Green’s proposed budget. 
Family planning services provide patients with a full range of birth control options, STI testing 
and treatment, pregnancy testing and options counseling, and cancer screenings. Title X funding 
is essential in supporting over 30 health care sites across the state, strengthening the healthcare 
workforce, ensuring same-day contraceptive care, and delivering essential health education. 
State funding is critical to supplement federal dollars and safeguard these essential services. In 
the West Hawaii community, one health center provided critical family planning services to over 
4,500 patients thanks to Title X funding. This included over 7,000 STI tests and contraceptive 
care for 3,700 patients. The consequences of reduced funding would be devastating for those 
who rely on these essential services. 
Despite Hawai‘i’s strong commitment to expanding access to care, additional action and funding 
are urgently needed to ensure that all residents can obtain the reproductive health services they 
need. 
Thank you for your time and consideration and your support

Reproductive and sexual health and rights are under attack in this country. Thus, in Hawaiʻi, we 
must ensure that safety-net family planning providers will continue to be able to provide 
essential healthcare services and have the necessary funding to do so. I believe that healthcare is 
a fundamental right for all people. Safety-net family planning providers (e.g., Planned 
Parenthood) ensure that essential reproductive and sexual healthcare can continue to be accessed 
by low income and underinsured individuals. These services include screenings for cervical 
cancer, STI testing and treatment, birth control services, and gender-affirming care. Thus, I 
strongly support increased funding in the proposed state budget (HB300) for family planning 
services.

Aloha Chair Yamashita, Vice Chair Takenouchi, and Committee Members: 
 My understanding is that HB300 contains language allowing for private involvement in the 
building and maintenance of a new prison.   There should never be private involvement in our 
detention system.   Incentivizing incarceration (ie-the more prisoners you have, the more money 
the private company makes)is immoral and unethical leading to innocent people being jailed 
and/or jailed for excessive terms.   Much like our health care system, this is a situation where the 
govenrment needs to be in full control of the system.    
Mahalo for your consideration

In Support of HB300 
Dear Chair Yamashita, 
I have worked in the health clinic setting, in the reproductive health specialty, for the last seven 
years. Over this time, I’ve witnessed firsthand the immense benefits that the Title X / Family 
Planning program has brought to our local community. The funding from this program is utilized 
daily in the reproductive health specialty, and it is essential for the continued success of these 
services. The health center I work for provided Family Planning services to over 4,500 patients 
in our community last year.  
Key aspects of the program include a wide range of services offered such as various 
contraceptive options, including emergency contraception, STI testing and treatment, pregnancy 
testing, and pregnancy options counseling. Importantly, these services include same-day 
contraceptive care. This program is especially crucial for our teenagers and patients who are 
either uninsured or underinsured by their insurance providers. 
Having accessible resources for patients to engage actively with their reproductive health rights 
is invaluable. These services not only provide immediate care, but they also have lasting positive 
effects on our community by allowing individuals to make informed decisions about their health 
and futures. 
The potential repercussions of cutting these services would be severe, leading to an increase in 
unplanned pregnancies and higher rates of STI transmission. This funding currently supports 30 
healthcare sites throughout Hawaii and has positively impacted thousands of lives. The 
continuity of these services is dependent on state funding, which is essential to supplement 
federal dollars and ensure that these reproductive health/ Family Planning services remain 
available to those who need them most. 
For the health and well-being of our community, I strongly urge the support of HB 300. 
 
Sincerely, 
T. Carvalho, RN, BSN

Aloha, 
For too long Hawaii has had the notorious record of having the highest rate of tooth decay in the 
nation. It also is too long for Hawaii to be without an Oral Health program for her people. It 
is time to invest in our children. By investing in oral health, we invest in their overall health. We 
need a proactive mindset, a proactive approach, a proactive program to change this shameful 
reality into a model of effective care that we can be proud of. It starts with passing HB300. 
Mahalo for your time and careful consideration, 
Lauren N. Bundschuh, DDS

As a taxpaying citizen concerned with wasteful expenditures, I write in STRONG OPPOSITION 
to provisions in HB300 that expand mass incarceration and the building of a new $1 billion super 
jail. 
The proposed budget includes an appropriation for the building of a new OCCC, but we don’t 
need a new, $1 billion jail. Instead, we need to fund youth and education programs, affordable 
housing, job training, family strengthening and violence interruption programs, community-
based health, treatment and reintegration programs rooted in evidence-based practices, and 
restorative justice to help us build communities that are safe, healthy, and equitable.

I am writing in support of using the money to build an updated version of the Oahu Community 
Correction Center (aka O.C.C.C). As it currently is, the O.C.C.C. is an outdated, unsanitary and 
inhumane facility.  It's time to be build a more updated, sanitary and humane facility for the 
inmates which will make it easier for them to access rehabilitative programs and eventually re-
enter normal society.   
Some opponents of the bill claim that "we don't need another jail". But there are some people 
who need to be in jail. We just got to ensure that the jail is updated, sanitary and humane for the 
inmates.

I oppose the appropriation of $1 billion dollars to build a new OCCC. We should be investing 
that monry into evidence based solutions that will get to the root of our issues. Those look like 
affordable housing, youth education, job training, diversion infrastructure, and community based 
health, treatment and reintegration programs.  
Mahalo.

Aloha Chair Yamashita, Vice Chair Takenouchi, and Committee Members: 
My name is Kristen Young, I grew up on O‘ahu and currently live in Makiki. In my individual 
capacity I participate as a member of the Reimagining Public Safety in Hawai‘i coalition and 
Faith Action for Community Equity which has advocated for housing and bail reform among 
other issues. I’m testifying in strong opposition to provisions in HB300 that expand mass 
incarceration and the building of a new $1 billion super jail. 
When I look around today at our islands, I am saddened by what I see. We have clearly not 
invested in the wellbeing of the people of this place. There are also things that much of the 
public does not get to see, such as our own neighbors locked up in jail/prison. According to 
Prison Policy Initiative, Hawai‘i’s incarceration rate stands out internationally, locking up a 
higher percentage of its people than almost any democratic country on Earth. Among those 
locked up, Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders, and Black residents are overrepresented. This 
should disturb all of us.  
People are not naturally criminals. We need to consider the conditions that can lead to someone 
being locked up in our legal system and address those. People don’t need to be locked up—
they need supportive housing, healthcare, treatment, food, community services and support. We 
CAN’T fund these things if we’re spending nearly $1 billion on a new jail and even more to then 
keep people in there. 
Budgets reveal what and who we care about. The proposed budget includes an appropriation for 
the building of a new OCCC, but we don’t need a new $1 billion jail. Instead, we need to fund 
youth and education programs, affordable housing, job training, family strengthening and 
violence interruption programs, community-based health, treatment and reintegration programs 
rooted in evidence-based practices, and restorative justice to help us build communities that are 
safe, healthy, and equitable. 
Last week, a bill that would provide universal free school meals for public school students was 
killed, not even given a hearing. I assume it was due to budget concerns. The fact that we (you) 
would not even entertain the possibility of feeding keiki while we proceed to lock up their 
caregivers is appalling and deeply concerning. 
 LATE *Testimony submitted late may not be considered by the Committee for decision making purposes. 

Investing in a new jail would be DIVESTING in infrastructure and services that could truly 
support our community and I believe this would increase harm in our communities. For this 
reason I oppose HB300. 
Please prioritize people, including the most vulnerable, in the budget. 
Mahalo for your time and consideration.

Aloha Chair Yamashita, Vice Chair Takenouchi, and Committee Members, 
I oppose provisions of the budget bill that expand mass incarceration and the building of a 
billion-dollar replacement for OCCC. How many people are in jail right now that don't need to 
be? According to our our DCR Director, too many. The recent report from Prison Policy 
Initiative demonstrates we don't need a billion dollar jail. We need to invest a fraction of those 
funds into decarceration measures (diversion programs, housing, etc.) and fully implement bail 
reform to ease overcrowding. If you build a bigger cage, which is the intention behind these 
additional appropriations, then you will fill it. As a constituent and taxpayer, I would rather you 
invest these funds into preventative measures, not a bigger and fancier cage.
