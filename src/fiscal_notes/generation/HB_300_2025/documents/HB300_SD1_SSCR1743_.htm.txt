ECONOMIC OUTLOOK
The Council on Revenues met to
forecast revenue growth for the general fund on March 12, 2025.
The Council on Revenues lowered its forecast
by 1.4% and 0.8% for fiscal year 2024-2025 and 2025-2026, respectively.
The forecast for fiscal years 2026‑2027,
2027-2028, 2028-2029, 2029-2030, and 2030-2031 was left unchanged at 2.9%, 2.5%,
2.6%, 1.9%, and 3.1%, respectively.
The revised forecast means a
decrease in revenues by $133,956,000, $213,280,000, $218,612,000, $224,296,000,
$228,557,000, and $235,642,000 for fiscal year 2024-2025, 2025‑2026,
2026-2027, 2027-2028, 2028-2029, 2029-2030, 2030-2031, respectively, totaling
$1,461,640,000.
The forecasts for the state general
fund tax revenues for fiscal year 2024-2025 through 2030-2021 are shown in the

Unexpected increases in individual
and corporate tax refunds resulted in reduced anticipated net revenues for the
current fiscal year.
A non-recurring
estate tax collection in the previous fiscal year increased the revenue base,
leading to a projected contraction in the upcoming fiscal year.
Federal action, including layoffs, cessation
of federal contracts and other federal funding, and implementation of trade
tariffs, threaten the State's economy.
According to the Economic Research
Organization at the University of Hawaii, near-term risks include federal
layoffs and funding cuts, which could fully nullify growth within the State.
The Governor's budget, as proposed, includes
federal funding in the amount of $3,875,555,199 for operating costs and 2,673.82
permanent and 572.93 temporary full-time equivalent positions in fiscal year
2025-2026; and in fiscal year 2026-2027, federal funding in the amount of $3,839,750,906
for operating costs and 2,673.82 permanent and 566.93 temporary full-time
equivalent positions.
The Economic
Research Organization at the University of Hawaii also suggests that new trade
tariffs and mass deportations imposed by the federal government could thwart
growth from our agriculture and construction sectors.
On January 25, 2025,
the U.S. House of Representatives passed a budget resolution that proposed a
potential $2,000,000,000,000 cut in federal spending impacting safety net
programs such as Medicaid, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP),
and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF).
On January 27, 2025, the Federal
Office of Management and Budget Memorandum No. M-25-13 was issued to the heads
of federal executive departments and agencies to require federal agencies to
identify and review all federal financial assistance programs and supporting
activities consistent with the President's policies and requirements, many of
which are outlined in the Executive Orders of the President, as noted in the
memorandum.
On January 29, 2025, the
memorandum was rescinded.
On February 13, 2025, Finance
Memorandum No. 25-03 was issued to conduct a survey of federal funds (means of
financing = "N") that each state agency has received or anticipates
receiving in fiscal year 2024-2025.
The
total amount of federal funds surveyed was $3,474,042,792.
The deadline for responses to the survey was
February 28, 2025, as detailed in the memorandum.
The memorandum also noted that a survey of
other federal awards (i.e. means of financing = "P") would be
conducted at a later date.
To date, no
survey results for means of financing "N" were published and no
survey for means of financing "P" was issued.
In March 2025, to prevent a
government shutdown, Congress passed a full-year continuing resolution that
extends federal funding through September 30, 2025, maintaining funding at
existing levels for most programs, including those targeted by the proposed
budget cuts, and thereby averting immediate reductions.
However, the continuing resolution also
includes a $13,000,000,000 decrease in non-defense discretionary spending and a
$6,000,000,000 increase in defense spending.
Your Committee finds that while the continuing
resolution provides temporary stability, it does not resolve the underlying
fiscal challenges, and the proposed substantial cuts to critical safety net
programs remain a looming threat to the economy.
​
In addition to fiscal challenges
presented by changes to federal policies, yet to be identified, the State must
fulfill the following obligations:
(1)
The State's obligation of the Maui wildfire
settlement in the amount of $882,500,000, including $75,000,000 pursuant to Act
10, Session Laws of Hawaii 2024, and $400,000,000 for fiscal year 2025-2026 and
$407,500,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027 pursuant to House Bill No. 1001;
(2)
Previously appropriated collective bargaining
amounts from prior acts, which total an additional $135,246,478 for fiscal year
2025-2026 and $161,185,454 for fiscal year 2026-2027 in general funds; and
(3)
The State's obligation to fulfill the
Employee's Retirement System, Employer-Union Health Benefits Trust Fund, debt
service, and Medicaid requirements for
fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027, which were included in the
Governor's proposed draft as detailed in the following table

$3,909,959,813
Your Committee finds that in the
face of economic uncertainty, the Governor proposed amendments that added
general fund appropriations to this measure, without making any reductions.
Your Committee must exercise its
constitutional mandate to adopt a balanced budget, upholding fiscal
responsibility to sustain essential public services that support residents and
drive economic stability.
PART III.
APPROACH TO THE SENATE DRAFT
Focusing on delivering impactful policies that uplift our
communities, fortify our economy, and protect Hawaii's agricultural innovations
and unparalleled natural resources, your Senate Majority has identified the
following priorities for the 2025 Regular Session:
(1)
Education and workforce development;
(2)
Housing, homelessness, and stabilizing Hawaii's
property insurance market;
(3)
General governance and constitutional rights;
(4)
Environmental sustainability and infrastructure;
and
(5)
Agricultural innovation and other revenue streams.
In accordance with the
priorities set forth by the Senate Majority, your Committee amended this
measure to advance meaningful solutions and continue providing the support our
communities need to thrive.
These amendments include changing
means of financing from general obligation bond funds to general funds for
certain capital improvement programs.
Cash-funded
capital improvement projects boost the construction industry, which helps to
stimulate the economy while directly combatting potential negative impacts from
adverse policy decisions made by the federal government.
Secondly, general-funded appropriations for
capital improvement projects provide flexibility for potential funding cuts in
the future.
To prepare for potential economic
downturns, the House Committee on Finance appropriated $200,000,000 in fiscal
year 2025-2026 for deposit into the emergency and budget reserve fund.
According to the Department of the Attorney
General, the following provision is recommended to execute the deposit:
"provided that of the general fund
appropriation to departmental administration and budget division (BUF101), the
sum of $200,000,000 or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year
2025-2026 shall be deposited into the emergency and budget reserve fund
established under section 328L-3, Hawaii Revised Statutes."
Your Committee finds that no such provision
was included in the measure, as received from the House Committee on Finance,
which calls into question the mechanics by which the proposed deposit can be
executed.
Furthermore, the most recent time
that the Legislature upheld its constitutional mandate to deposit funds into
the emergency and budget reserve fund, the Governor slashed that appropriation.
House Bill No. 40, Session Laws of
Hawaii 2024, as adopted by the Legislature, included a $300,000,000 deposit
into the emergency and budget reserve fund.
However, the Governor line-item vetoed the
$300,000,000 to just $1, pursuant to Governor's Message No. 1330, dated July 8,
2024.
In 2023, the Legislature similarly
attempted to deposit additional funds, in the amount of $500,000,000 for fiscal
year 2024-2025 into the emergency and budget reserve fund.
The same amount was line-item vetoed pursuant
to Governor's Message No. 1233, dated June 29, 2023.
Therefore, your Committee finds that the
Governor has not expressed a willingness to accept the Legislature's intent to
bolster reserves, thereby circumventing the Legislature's authority to
appropriate funds out of the emergency and budget reserve fund during times of
emergency, severe economic downturn, or unforeseen reduction in revenues.
Therefore, your Committee finds that funding
for the emergency and budget reserve fund, although fiscally responsible at
face value, is not an effective use of resources.
Taken together, your Committee has
set aside general funds in the amount of $262,200,000 for capital improvement
projects to provide a near-term stimulus for the economy while ensuring long‑term
flexibility in the face of fiscal uncertainty.
In accordance with the general
policies set forth by Finance Memorandum No. 24-10, your Committee amended this
measure to reduce positions vacant since July 1, 2020.
Finance Memorandum No. 24-10 states that positions
vacant since July 1, 2020, shall be deleted.
This measure, as proposed, was not consistent
in implementing this directive.
Your Committee received updated
lists of vacant positions from each department in March, which informed
amendments to reduce long-term vacancies in this proposed draft.
Excluded from these lists were positions
filled by any means or positions for which a qualified candidate has been
selected.
Position numbers from these
vacancy lists were utilized to extract information from Budget Journal Tables
provided by the Department of Budget and Finance, which provide specific
information on each budgeted position, including the means of financing and
budgeted salaries.
Budget Journal Tables
for the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands, Department of Land and Natural
Resources, Department of Law Enforcement, and the Department of Health-Hawaii
Health Systems Corporation were provided by the Department of Budget and
Finance on March 28, 2025, and therefore could not be utilized for this
analysis.
As such, your Committee amended this
measure to increase reductions from long-term vacancies to over 150.00
permanent and 120.00 temporary full-time equivalent general-funded positions,
resulting in nearly $15,000,000 in general-fund savings for each of fiscal years
2025-2026 and 2026-2027.
For all means
of financing, your Committee amended this measure to increase reductions from
long-term vacancies to over 500.00 permanent and 150.00 temporary full-time
equivalent positions, resulting in nearly $50,000,000 in savings across all
means of financing.
Finally, your Committee provided
funding in fiscal year 2025‑2026 only for most new programs to allow for
fiscal flexibility in the face of economic uncertainties caused by policies of
the federal administration.
PART
IV.
THE SENATE DRAFT
Your Committee highlights
the following changes that were incorporated in the House Draft that negatively
impact the safety, financial sustainability, and prosperity of the State:
(1)
A general fund reduction of $1,999,999 for
fiscal year 2025-2026 from $2,000,000 to $1 for irrigation systems;
(2)
A special fund ceiling reduction of
$49,500,000 for fiscal year 2025-2026 from $49,500,000 to $0 for the New Aloha
Stadium Entertainment District;
(3)
A general fund reduction of $99,999 and 1.00
permanent full-time equivalent position for fiscal year 2025-2026 and fiscal
year 2026-2027 from $100,000 to $1 for the Hawaii Community Development
Authority's ninety-nine year leasehold program;
(4)
A general fund reduction of $465,000 for
fiscal year 2025-2026 and fiscal year 2026-2027 from $465,000 to $0 for Public
Charter School teacher differentials; and
(5)
A reduction of $876,000 and 6.00 permanent
full-time equivalent positions for fiscal year 2025-2026 and fiscal year
2026-2027 from $876,000 to $0 for the Office of Wellness and Resilience's State
of Well-Being Project.
Your Committee received testimony from the
impacted departments that details some of the negative impacts of each of the
aforementioned adjustments included in House Bill No. 300, H.D. 1, as
amended by the House Committee on Finance.
Your Committee
received testimony from the Department of Agriculture to restore the $2,000,000
general fund appropriation for irrigation systems, as proposed.
The proposed general fund appropriation will
aid in keeping irrigation water rates affordable for users and supports
agricultural production.
The general
fund appropriation would help the State meet statutorily mandated food goals,
pursuant to sections 27-8 and 302A-405.6, Hawaii Revised Statutes.
Your
Committee notes that current irrigation costs are $0.50 per 1,000 gallons.
Failure to secure the proposed general fund
appropriation would result in irrigation costs of $1.11 per 1,000 gallons, a
significant cost increase.
The
restoration of the $2,000,000 general fund appropriation would minimize
projected cost increases, resulting in irrigation costs of $0.52 per $1,000
gallons.
Your Committee remains
steadfast in its commitment to support local farmers.
Therefore,
your Committee recommends supporting the proposed general fund
appropriation in the amount of $2,000,000 to assist local farmers.
Your Committee
received testimony from the Department of Business, Economic Development, and
Tourism to restore the $100,000 general fund appropriation and 1.00 permanent
full-time equivalent position for the ninety-nine year leasehold program, as
proposed, pursuant to Act 97, Session Laws of Hawaii 2023.
According to the Hawaii Community Development
Authority, the position is currently filled.
Therefore, failure to secure the proposed
general fund appropriation would result in a reduction in force and force one
person into unemployment.
After years of
adopting rules to execute Act 97, Session Laws of Hawaii 2023, the proposed
general fund appropriation will allow the Hawaii Community Development
Authority to deliver on plans for an affordable residential condominium
building.
Your Committee remains
steadfast in its commitment to support affordable housing.
Therefore, your Committee recommends
supporting the proposed general fund appropriation in the amount of $100,000
and 1.00 permanent full-time equivalent position for the Hawaii Community
Development Authority.
Your Committee
received testimony from the Department of Business, Economic Development, and
Tourism and the Stadium Authority to restore the $49,500,000 special fund
ceiling increase for the New Aloha Stadium Entertainment District, as proposed.
The proposed ceiling increase would
allow the Stadium Authority to expend funds previously appropriated by the Legislature,
as agreed upon by the House Committee on Finance, in Act 248, Session Laws of
Hawaii 2022, to advance the New Aloha Stadium Entertainment District.
Failure to increase the special fund ceiling
could delay the execution of the stadium development and operation agreement,
jeopardizing the millions of dollars already invested in this project by the
State.
Moreover, the proposed ceiling
increase would help to ensure the project's long-term sustainability and
positive impact on Hawaii's communities.
Your Committee remains steadfast in its
commitment to support economic resilience.
Therefore, your Committee recommends
supporting the proposed special fund ceiling increase in the amount of
$49,500,000 for the New Aloha Stadium Entertainment District.
Your Committee
received testimony from the Hawaii State Public Charter School Commission to
restore the $465,000 general fund appropriation for teacher differentials.
The proposed general fund appropriation would
cover the collectively-bargained differentials for teachers in hard-to-staff
geographic areas and Hawaiian immersion programs.
According to the Hawaii State Public Charter
School Commission, this includes over three hundred teachers across the State.
Your Committee remains steadfast in its
commitment to support teachers.
Therefore,
your Committee recommends supporting
the proposed general fund appropriation in the amount of $465,000 for the
Hawaii State Public Charter School Commission.
Your Committee
received testimony from the Office of Wellness and Resilience to restore the
$876,000 general fund appropriation and 6.00 permanent full-time equivalent
positions for the State of Well-Being Project, as proposed, pursuant to Act
106, Session Laws of Hawaii 2024.
The
proposed general fund appropriation enables the Office of Wellness and
Resilience to continue working on
Hawaii's
largest statewide health survey ever, as well as the largest dataset using the
Center for Disease Control's National Institute for Occupational Safety and
Health Worker Well-being Questionnaire.
The testimony states that the Office of
Wellness and Resilience has built partnerships with city, county, state, and
community stakeholders and that all six positions are filled.
Therefore, failure to secure the proposed
general fund appropriation would result in a reduction in force and force six
people into unemployment.
The testimony
further states that without the proposed general fund appropriation, the Office
of Wellness and Resilience will not be able to execute critical deliverables to
support the mental health and well-being of first responders, healthcare
providers, and school staff within communities of need.
Your Committee remains steadfast in its
commitment to support first responders, healthcare providers, and school staff.
Therefore, your Committee recommends
supporting the proposed general fund appropriation in the amount of $876,000
and 8.00 permanent full-time equivalent positions for the Office of Wellness
and Resilience.
Having received
testimony on the impacts of changes included in House Bill No. 300, House Draft
1, your Committee has worked in collaboration with each impacted department to
identify the resources needed to deliver critical programs and services.
Following the latest downward
forecast from the Council on Revenues and amidst ongoing economic uncertainty,
your Committee has adopted a budget that maintains essential services for the State's
most vulnerable populations and proactively expands the economy through
strategic investments in emerging sectors.
With potential cuts in federal funding and
policy changes that could result in broader economic challenges, your Senate
remains steadfast in its commitment to foster economic resilience and advance
meaningful solutions that Hawaii communities need to thrive.
This wholistic approach makes strategic
appropriations to promote system changes and implement priorities of the Senate
as follows:
Education and Workforce Development
•
Add 1.00 position and $55,068 in FY26 and
$110,136 in FY27 to advance financial literacy education initiatives statewide.
•
Add 2.00 positions and $220,272 for
educational programming for students in residential facilities and for
neglected and delinquent youth.
•
Add $1,450,000 in FY26 and FY27 to address
healthcare workforce shortages in collaboration with the Department of
