  "overview": "This bill amends state law to allow community members to protest the renewal of certain liquor licenses, specifically for establishments near schools or parks that sell liquor for on-site consumption. Previously, the law only permitted such protests for the issuance of new licenses, not renewals. The purpose is to provide communities an ongoing opportunity to address concerns about liquor establishments in their vicinity.",
  "appropriations": "This measure does not contain any appropriations. No state or county funds are allocated for its implementation. Any associated administrative costs are expected to be absorbed by the existing budgets of the respective county liquor commissions.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal analysis assumes a potential minor increase in administrative workload for county liquor commissions due to processing protests for license renewals. As the volume of future protests is unknown, a precise cost cannot be calculated, but it is presumed to be minimal. The methodology relies on the assessment that existing agency staff can manage the new procedural requirements within their current operational capacity.",
  "agency_impact": "The measure will primarily impact the liquor commissions of each county by adding the responsibility of processing and verifying community protests for license renewals. This will require agencies to adapt their administrative procedures but is not expected to necessitate additional staff or significant resource allocation. The impact is anticipated to be operational rather than budgetary.",
  "economic_impact": "This bill is not expected to have a direct, measurable economic impact on the state or counties. Indirectly, the denial of a license renewal could lead to a business closure, while successful protests may reduce negative externalities in communities near schools and parks. There are no anticipated cost savings or significant reductions in other government expenditures.",
  "policy_impact": "This measure amends Hawaii Revised Statutes ยง281-39.5 to expand local community input on the continued operation of liquor establishments. It removes the existing protection for current license holders from renewal protests, thereby strengthening local oversight. This aligns with a broader policy goal of balancing commercial interests with community well-being, particularly concerning minors.",
  "revenue_sources": "This bill does not introduce new revenue sources. The operations of county liquor commissions are primarily funded by license fees and county general funds. There is a potential for a minor decrease in license fee revenue if renewals are successfully protested and subsequently denied.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "Over a six-year period, this bill is not projected to have a significant fiscal impact on the State or counties. The county liquor commissions will incur minor, absorbable administrative costs related to processing an unknown number of renewal protests. These duties include verifying protestor eligibility and potentially conducting additional hearings. No new positions or significant increases in operating expenses are anticipated. The potential loss of revenue from denied license renewals is expected to be negligible to the counties' overall budgets. Therefore, no additional appropriations are deemed necessary to implement this measure over the next six years.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "A minor negative impact on county operating revenues may occur. If a liquor license renewal is denied as a result of a successful community protest, the county will lose the corresponding annual renewal fee revenue. The overall fiscal impact from this potential revenue loss is expected to be minimal.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "This measure has no impact on capital expenditures. It does not require any investment in facilities, major equipment, or technology infrastructure. The new procedural requirements can be managed with existing agency resources.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "Beyond the six-year period, the fiscal implications are expected to remain negligible. The administrative costs of handling renewal protests will become a permanent part of the baseline workload for county liquor commissions. No significant ongoing fiscal obligations or long-term costs are anticipated as a result of this measure.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "No previous fiscal note was provided for comparison."
