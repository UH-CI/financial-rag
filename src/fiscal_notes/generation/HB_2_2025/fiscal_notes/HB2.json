  "overview": "The purpose of this Act is to provide communities the opportunity to protest the renewal of certain liquor licenses. The legislature finds that section 281-39.5, Hawaii Revised Statutes, currently applies only to the issuance of new liquor licenses, but not the renewal of current licenses, thus creating a safe harbor for existing establishments. This bill amends section 281-39.5, Hawaii Revised Statutes, to apply to both the issuance of new liquor licenses and the renewal of existing liquor licenses for on-site sale and consumption by the drink.",
  "appropriations": "This measure does not contain any appropriations.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "This bill has no financial impact on the State General Fund, as it pertains to the administrative functions of county liquor commissions. Therefore, no assumptions or methodology for financial projections are required.",
  "agency_impact": "This bill will impact the Liquor Commission or other licensing agency of each county. These agencies shall deny the renewal of certain current liquor licenses upon receipt of sufficient protests. This expands their responsibility from only handling protests for new licenses to also managing protests for license renewals.",
  "economic_impact": "This bill is not expected to have a significant economic impact on the State. Its primary focus is to address how patrons leaving a liquor establishment can adversely affect neighboring residents and users of nearby public facilities. There may be an economic impact on establishments whose license renewals are successfully protested and denied, but the provided documents do not quantify this potential effect.",
  "policy_impact": "This Act amends section 281-39.5, Hawaii Revised Statutes, to apply to the renewal of existing liquor licenses, not just the issuance of new ones. Previously, the statute created a 'safe harbor for existing establishments seeking a renewal of their liquor license.' The policy change is intended to promote an environment in which alcohol imbibing patrons do not interfere with minors or other residents near establishments located near schools or parks.",
  "revenue_sources": "This measure does not generate any revenue, nor does it require any funding sources.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "This bill has no fiscal implications for the State of Hawaii. The administration of liquor licensing is a county function, and any potential increase in administrative workload or decrease in license renewal fee revenue would be borne by the respective counties. No state funds are involved, and no six-year fiscal impact is anticipated at the state level.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "This measure is not anticipated to have any impact on state operating revenues.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "This measure does not require any capital expenditures.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "There are no fiscal implications for the State of Hawaii after six years as a result of this measure.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "This is the first fiscal note for this bill."
