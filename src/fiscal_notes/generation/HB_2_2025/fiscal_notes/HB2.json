  "overview": "The legislature finds that patrons leaving a liquor establishment can adversely affect neighboring residents and users of nearby public facilities. [1] The legislature further finds that section 281-39.5, Hawaii Revised Statutes, currently applies only to the issuance of new liquor licenses, but not the renewal of current licenses, thus creating a safe harbor for existing establishments seeking a renewal of their liquor license.
