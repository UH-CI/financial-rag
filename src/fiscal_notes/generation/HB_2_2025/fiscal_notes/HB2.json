  "overview": "This bill amends state law to allow community members to protest the renewal of existing liquor licenses for establishments located near schools or parks. Currently, such protests are only permitted for the issuance of new liquor licenses. The purpose is to provide communities an opportunity to voice concerns about established businesses based on their operational history and impact on the neighborhood.",
  "appropriations": "This measure does not contain any appropriations. It is a statutory amendment focused on policy and does not create a new program or require funding for implementation. Any minor administrative costs incurred would be absorbed by the respective county liquor commissions.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "This fiscal analysis is based solely on the proposed statutory change outlined in the bill text. As the measure has no direct financial component, no quantitative assumptions or cost estimation methodologies were necessary. The assessment concludes there is no direct state fiscal impact, though a minor, unquantifiable workload increase for counties is anticipated.",
  "agency_impact": "This bill is expected to increase the administrative workload of county liquor commissions, which will now be required to process and hold hearings for protests against license renewals. This may result in additional staff time for investigations, notifications, and public hearings. The exact impact is indeterminate as it depends on the future volume of protests filed by community members.",
  "economic_impact": "This measure has no direct state economic impact and is not expected to affect the state's economy. However, it could have an indirect economic effect on individual businesses whose liquor license renewals are successfully protested and denied. Conversely, communities may benefit from reduced nuisance complaints and potential increases in property values near establishments that are denied renewals.",
  "policy_impact": "This bill amends section 281-39.5, Hawaii Revised Statutes, to expand the scope of public protests concerning liquor licenses. It removes the existing protection for current license holders by making renewals subject to the same community protest process as new applications. This policy change strengthens local community input into the ongoing operation of liquor establishments.",
  "revenue_sources": "No new revenue sources are created or required by this bill. The administrative costs incurred by county liquor commissions are expected to be absorbed within their existing operating budgets, which are funded through county funds and licensing fees. The bill does not alter existing license fee structures.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "Over the next six years, this bill is not expected to have any direct fiscal impact on the State of Hawaii's general fund. County governments may experience a minor and indeterminate increase in administrative costs associated with processing a new category of protests. These costs would be related to staff time for handling paperwork, conducting investigations, and holding public hearings for renewal protests. The frequency of such protests cannot be reliably predicted, making a precise cost estimate difficult. The workload increase is anticipated to be absorbed by existing staff and resources at the county liquor commissions. No new positions are expected to be required at the state or county level as a result of this bill. Therefore, the six-year fiscal implication is considered negligible for the state and minimal for the counties.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "There is no anticipated direct impact on state or county operating revenues. County revenues could experience a negligible decrease if a license renewal is denied, resulting in the loss of that specific license's renewal fee. This potential loss is considered incidental and not fiscally significant.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "This bill does not require any capital expenditures. The proposed changes are procedural and administrative in nature, affecting the process for license renewals. No new facilities, equipment, or technology infrastructure are needed for implementation.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The fiscal implications after the initial six-year period are expected to remain consistent with the initial outlook. There will be no direct fiscal impact on the state. County liquor commissions will continue to face a potentially higher, but likely minimal and absorbable, administrative workload due to the permanent change in protest procedures.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "No previous fiscal note was provided for comparison. This is the first fiscal analysis for this bill."
