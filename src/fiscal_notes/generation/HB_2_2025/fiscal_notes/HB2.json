  "overview": "This bill amends Hawaii Revised Statutes, section 281-39.5, to allow community members to protest the renewal of existing liquor licenses for establishments near schools or parks. The purpose of this Act is to provide communities the opportunity to protest the renewal of certain liquor licenses for on-site consumption, a right currently limited to new license applications. This change removes the safe harbor for existing establishments and subjects them to the same protest and denial process as new applicants.",
  "appropriations": "This bill does not contain any appropriations. No state or county funds are allocated for its implementation. All activities required under this measure are expected to be handled within the existing budgets of the respective county liquor commissions.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "No financial projections were calculated as the bill has no direct fiscal impact and includes no appropriations. The fiscal analysis assumes that any increase in administrative workload for county liquor commissions due to processing renewal protests will be minimal. This assumption is based on the procedural nature of the statutory change, which does not create a new program or require new resources.",
  "agency_impact": "The measure will primarily affect the liquor commission of each county by expanding the scope of their license review process to include renewals under the protest provision. This may result in a minor increase in administrative workload related to processing protests and conducting hearings for license renewals. It is anticipated that these additional duties can be absorbed within existing staff resources and operational budgets.",
  "economic_impact": "The economic impact of this measure is indeterminate and indirect. While it could potentially lead to the non-renewal of some liquor licenses, thereby affecting individual business revenues, it is not expected to have a broad economic effect. No cost savings or significant community-wide economic benefits are specified in the bill.",
  "policy_impact": "This bill amends state law to empower local communities by extending their right to protest liquor licenses from only new applications to also include renewals. It modifies section 281-39.5, Hawaii Revised Statutes, to ensure that existing establishments are subject to the same level of community scrutiny as new ones. This policy change enhances local governance and community input regarding establishments that sell liquor for on-site consumption.",
  "revenue_sources": "This measure does not create, require, or identify any revenue sources. It is a regulatory change with no associated funding. Any administrative costs incurred by county agencies are expected to be covered by their existing operational funds, which may include sources like general funds or license fees.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "This bill has no direct fiscal implications for the state or counties over the next six years. It does not appropriate any funds, authorize any new positions, or create a program requiring expenditures. The administrative impact on county liquor commissions from handling potential protests for license renewals is expected to be absorbable within their existing budgets. There are no projected costs, recurring expenses, or staffing changes resulting from this legislation. The fiscal outlook remains neutral as this is a non-financial, procedural amendment to existing law.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "This bill is not expected to have a material impact on operating revenues. While a county could lose a small amount of license fee revenue if a license is not renewed as a result of a protest, this potential loss is considered negligible. The measure does not introduce any new fees or change any existing revenue structures.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "There are no capital expenditures associated with this bill. The measure amends a statutory process and does not require any investment in facilities, equipment, or technology. No capital improvement projects or purchases are authorized or necessitated by this act.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The fiscal implications after six years are expected to remain nonexistent, consistent with the initial period. As a permanent procedural change to statute, it does not create any ongoing or future fiscal obligations for the state or counties. Any minor administrative costs will continue to be absorbed by the existing budgets of the relevant county agencies.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "No previous fiscal note was provided."
