  "overview": "The purpose of this Act is to provide communities the opportunity to protest the renewal of certain liquor licenses. [1] This bill amends section 281-39.5, Hawaii Revised Statutes, to apply to both the issuance of new liquor licenses, and the renewal of existing liquor licenses. [1] It provides that the Liquor Commission or other licensing agency of each county shall deny the renewal of certain current liquor licenses upon receipt of sufficient protests. [1]",
  "appropriations": "This bill does not contain any appropriations. [1] No funding amounts are specified for staffing, training, or any other operational costs associated with its implementation. [1] The measure does not allocate any financial resources. [1]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The provided legislative text does not contain any financial projections, assumptions, or a methodology for estimating costs. [1] The potential increase in workload for county liquor commissions is not quantified. [1] No data sources or comparable programs are referenced to determine the fiscal impact. [1]",
  "agency_impact": "This measure will affect the Liquor Commission or other licensing agency of each county. [1] These agencies will be required to handle protests for the renewal of existing liquor licenses, which is an expansion of the current law that applies only to new licenses. [1] This change may increase the administrative workload for processing protests and conducting related proceedings. [1]",
  "economic_impact": "The legislature finds that patrons leaving a liquor establishment can adversely affect neighboring residents and users of nearby public facilities. [1] The Act is intended to promote an environment in which alcohol imbibing patrons do not interfere with minors or other residents. [1] The bill does not specify any direct economic impacts, such as cost savings or revenue generation for the state or counties. [1]",
  "policy_impact": "This Act amends section 281-39.5, Hawaii Revised Statutes, by expanding its applicability. [1] The bill alters the existing statute which currently applies only to the issuance of new liquor licenses, but not the renewal of current licenses. [1] This removes what the legislature finds is a safe harbor for existing establishments seeking a renewal of their liquor license. [1]",
  "revenue_sources": "The bill does not identify any revenue sources to support its implementation. [1] No general funds, special funds, or fees are mentioned as sources of funding for the potential increase in administrative duties for county agencies. [1] The measure does not establish any new revenue streams. [1]",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The provided text does not contain specific information to determine the six-year fiscal implications of this measure. [1] The bill does not appropriate funds or authorize any positions. [1] Any fiscal impact would affect the respective county liquor commissions, not the state. [1] The costs would be contingent on the number of liquor license renewal applications that are protested by the community, which is an unknown variable. [1] An increase in protests would likely lead to increased administrative costs for processing applications and holding hearings. [1] As the volume of future protests cannot be predicted, the potential costs are indeterminate. [1] The bill does not provide projections for costs, staffing changes, or recurring expenses over a multi-year period. [1] Statutory material to be repealed is bracketed and stricken. [1] New statutory material is underscored. [1] This Act shall take effect upon its approval. [1]",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The bill is not anticipated to have a direct impact on state or county operating revenues. [1] No new fees, fines, or other revenue-generating mechanisms are established in the Act. [1] A potential indirect impact could be a loss of license renewal fee revenue for counties if a significant number of licenses are successfully protested and denied, but this is not specified in the text. [1]",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "This bill does not require any capital expenditures. [1] There is no mention of costs for facilities, equipment, or technology infrastructure. [1] The measure is a statutory amendment and does not include any provisions related to capital improvement projects. [1]",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The fiscal implications after six years are indeterminate but ongoing. [1] As the bill amends a statute without a sunset provision, the change allowing protests of license renewals will be permanent. [1] Consequently, any associated administrative costs for county liquor commissions would be recurring and depend on the level of community protest activity in any given year. [1]",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "No previous fiscal note was provided for comparison. [1]"
