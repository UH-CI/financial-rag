  "overview": "This bill proposes to amend section 281-39.5 of the Hawaii Revised Statutes concerning liquor licenses. The primary purpose is to extend the right of community members to protest the renewal of existing liquor licenses, a right currently limited to the issuance of new licenses. By removing the exemption for renewals, the measure allows the Liquor Commission of each county to deny a license renewal if sufficient protests are received from the community.",
  "appropriations": "This bill does not appropriate any funds. It is a statutory amendment that does not include any financial allocations. All activities resulting from this measure would need to be handled within the existing budgets of the respective county agencies.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "This fiscal note does not contain financial projections as the bill does not have a direct, quantifiable fiscal impact on the state. The analysis is based on the administrative and regulatory changes proposed in the bill's text. Any potential costs to county liquor commissions are considered absorbable within their existing operational budgets.",
  "agency_impact": "The measure will impact the Liquor Commission or other licensing agencies in each county by potentially increasing their administrative workload. These agencies will be required to process and verify protests for license renewals, which could lead to more contested hearings. This change will require agencies to adapt their procedures for license renewals to accommodate the new protest provisions.",
  "economic_impact": "The direct economic impact of this measure is indeterminate. While it could lead to the non-renewal of some liquor licenses, potentially affecting individual business revenues and employment, it may also address community concerns about public nuisance, which could have positive, though unquantifiable, effects on neighborhood quality of life and property values. No data is provided to estimate the net economic effect.",
  "policy_impact": "This bill amends state policy by empowering local communities with greater influence over the renewal of liquor licenses near sensitive areas like schools and parks. It modifies section 281-39.5, Hawaii Revised Statutes, to align the process for license renewals with that for new licenses regarding community protests. This change strengthens local control over liquor establishments and their impact on surrounding neighborhoods.",
  "revenue_sources": "This measure does not create a new program or require funding, and therefore, no revenue sources are identified or required. The bill focuses on amending regulatory procedures for liquor license renewals. Any associated administrative costs are expected to be covered by the existing budgets of the county liquor commissions.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "This measure is not expected to have any direct fiscal implications for the State of Hawaii over the next six years. The bill does not appropriate state funds or create a new state-level program. Any fiscal impact would be at the county level, affecting the workload of the respective liquor commissions. These county agencies may experience an increase in administrative costs related to processing protests and conducting additional hearings for license renewals. However, these costs are anticipated to be minimal and absorbable within the agencies' existing operating budgets. There are no projected costs, staffing changes, or recurring expenses at the state level resulting from this bill. The measure does not include provisions for program expansion or sunset clauses.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "This bill is not anticipated to have any direct impact on state operating revenues. County revenues could be minimally affected if the number of license renewal denials increases, resulting in a loss of renewal fee income. However, this potential impact is speculative and cannot be quantified based on the provided text.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "This measure does not require any capital expenditures. The bill is a statutory amendment that modifies regulatory processes. No investments in facilities, equipment, or technology infrastructure are necessary for its implementation.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "There are no anticipated fiscal implications for the state after the initial six-year period. The bill amends a regulatory process and does not establish any ongoing state programs or financial obligations. Any long-term fiscal impact would remain at the county level and would be limited to administrative costs, which are expected to be managed within existing budgets.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "No previous fiscal note was provided for comparison."
