  "overview": "The purpose of this measure is to increase the capital gains tax rate for individuals, estates, and trusts to nine percent and the alternative capital gains tax rate for corporations to five percent. [7] Your Committee has amended this measure by changing the capital gains tax rate for individuals, estates, and trusts and alternative capital gains tax rate for corporations to unspecified percentages. [7] This Act shall take effect on July 1, 3000. [6]",
  "appropriations": "This measure does not contain an appropriation. [7] Revenue generated from this adjustment could be used to support essential services, invest in affordable housing, or improve infrastructure, benefiting residents and strengthening Hawaii's economy. [5] This revenue is needed to help fund the ongoing critical needs of the state, including housing, education, health care, infrastructure, and programs to assist working families and others in need. [5]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "Based on a July 1, 2025 effective date, the Department of Taxation (DOTAX) estimates the revenue gain. [5] The estimates are broken down by Individual Income Tax and Corporate Income Tax over a six-year period. [5] The projections are based on the original proposal to increase the capital gains tax rate for individuals, estates, and trusts from 7.25 percent to 9 percent, and the alternative capital gains tax for corporations from 4 percent to 5 per cent. [5]",
  "agency_impact": "The Department of Taxation (DOTAX) offers comments regarding H.B. 476, H.D. 1, for your consideration. [5] DOTAX requests that the effective date of the bill be amended to apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024 (or to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025) to avoid the ambiguity and uncertainty that would arise from a change in tax rates in the middle of a taxable year. [5] Your Committee has amended this measure by changing the capital gains tax rate for individuals, estates, and trusts and alternative capital gains tax rate for corporations to unspecified percentages. [7]",
  "economic_impact": "Eighty percent of all long-term capital gains in Hawaiʻi are earned by the wealthiest group of taxpayers—those who have incomes of at least $400,000 (HB476_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_.PDF.txt). [5] Proponents state the generated revenue could be used to fund vital state priorities, such as public education, environmental preservation, health care, and mental health services. [5] Opponents believe a capital gains tax increase may act to discourage new capital investment coming into the State and that a tax increase of any magnitude in Hawaii’s fragile economy will have a negative impact. [5] [5]",
  "policy_impact": "This measure amends section 235-51(f), Hawaii Revised Statutes, which applies to individuals, estates, and trusts. [6] It also amends section 235-71.5, Hawaii Revised Statutes, concerning the alternative tax for corporations. [6] Your Committee has amended this measure by changing the capital gains tax rate for individuals, estates, and trusts and alternative capital gains tax rate for corporations to unspecified percentages. [7]",
  "revenue_sources": "The measure is designed to generate revenue for the General Fund. [5] The Department of Taxation's estimates, based on a July 1, 2025 effective date, project revenue gains from both individual and corporate income taxes. [5] Total estimated revenue gains range from $74.6 million (HB476_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_.PDF.txt) to $85.0 million (HB476_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_.PDF.txt) annually over the six-year forecast period. [5]",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "This Act shall take effect on July 1, 3000, and therefore has no fiscal implications within the next six years. [6] However, for reference, the Department of Taxation (DOTAX) provided estimates based on a July 1, 2025 effective date. [5] The estimated total revenue gain for FY2026 is $84.4 million (HB476_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_.PDF.txt). [5] For FY2027, the estimated gain is $85.0 million (HB476_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_.PDF.txt). [5] The estimate for FY2028 is $80.4 million (HB476_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_.PDF.txt). [5] The estimate for FY2029 is $74.6 million (HB476_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_.PDF.txt). [5] For FY2030, the projected gain is $82.2 million (HB476_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_.PDF.txt). [5] For FY2031, the estimated revenue gain is $85.0 million (HB476_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_.PDF.txt). [5] These estimates were based on the specific tax rate increases in H.D. 1. [5] Since the rates in H.D. 2 are now unspecified, the actual fiscal impact is indeterminate. [7]",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "Due to the effective date of July 1, 3000, this measure will have no impact on operating revenue in the foreseeable future. [6] As a reference, the Department of Taxation estimated a potential general fund impact for FY2026 of $84.4 million (HB476_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_.PDF.txt) and for FY2027 of $85.0 million (HB476_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_.PDF.txt). [5] The actual revenue impact is now unknown because the measure was amended to change the tax rates to unspecified percentages. [7]",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "This measure does not involve any capital expenditures. [7] The bill amends tax statutes and does not contain provisions for investments in facilities, equipment, or technology infrastructure. [6] This section remains unchanged from the previous fiscal note. [6]",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "This Act shall take effect on July 1, 3000. [6] Therefore, there are no fiscal implications for the period immediately following the next six years. [6] Any long-term fiscal impact is contingent on the effective date being changed and the unspecified percentages for the tax rates being defined in future legislation. [7]",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The most significant update is that the Committee on Finance has amended the measure by changing the capital gains tax rate for individuals, estates, and trusts and alternative capital gains tax rate for corporations to unspecified percentages. [7] The previous fiscal note was based on specific proposed increases to nine percent and five percent. [7] This note also incorporates new, detailed six-year revenue projections from the Department of Taxation, which replace older estimates; the new figures project a total revenue gain of $84.4 million (HB476_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_.PDF.txt) in FY2026, increasing to $85.0 million (HB476_HD1_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-24-25_.PDF.txt) in FY2031. [5] Although the effective date remains July 1, 3000, these new estimates serve as a more current reference for the potential fiscal impact of the originally proposed rate increases. [5]"
