  "overview": "The purpose of this measure is to increase the capital gains tax rate for individuals, estates, and trusts to nine percent and the alternative capital gains tax rate for corporations to five percent. [4] The bill amends section 235-51(f), Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS), by increasing the capital gains tax rate for individuals, estates, and trusts from 7.25 percent to 9 percent and amends section 235-71.5(2)(B), HRS, by increasing the alternative capital gains tax for corporations from 4 percent to 5 per cent. [2] Your Committee has amended this measure by changing the effective date to July 1, 3000, to encourage further discussion. [4]",
  "appropriations": "This measure does not contain an appropriation. [4] The bill is an act relating to capital gains tax. [4] Revenue generated from this adjustment could be used to support essential services, invest in affordable housing, or improve infrastructure. [2]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The potential fiscal impact of this measure is based on estimates made in 2021. [4] These estimates project revenue that would be generated by the same capital gains tax rate increases proposed by this measure. [4] The Committee notes these figures as a reference for potential fiscal impact. [4]",
  "agency_impact": "The Department of Taxation offered comments on the bill for consideration. [2] The Department requests that the effective date of the bill be amended to apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024 to avoid the ambiguity and uncertainty that would arise from a change in tax rate in the middle of a taxable year. [2] The committee subsequently amended the bill's effective date to July 1, 3000. [4]",
  "economic_impact": "Your Committee finds that eighty percent of all long-term capital gains in the State are earned by the wealthiest group of taxpayers, who have incomes greater than $400,000 (HB476_HD1_HSCR498_.htm.txt), exacerbating the State's income inequality. [4] Testimony in support suggests that revenue generated could be used to support essential services, invest in affordable housing, or improve infrastructure. [2] Testimony in opposition states that a higher capital gains tax could discourage business expansion and innovation and have a negative impact as costs soar due to higher taxes. [2] [2]",
  "policy_impact": "This measure amends section 235-51(f), HRS, to increase the maximum capital gains rate for individuals from 7.25% to 9%. [2] It also amends section 235-71.5, HRS, to increase the maximum capital gains rate for corporations from 4% to 5%. [2] This measure addresses the issue of income inequality by increasing the capital gains tax rate. [4]",
  "revenue_sources": "This measure does not appropriate funds from a specific revenue source. [4] Instead, it is intended to generate additional state revenue. [2] As a reference, the committee notes that estimates from 2021 project the measure would be generated as follows: (1) $53,700,000 (HB476_HD1_HSCR498_.htm.txt) for fiscal year 2025; (2) $55,500,000 (HB476_HD1_HSCR498_.htm.txt) for fiscal year 2026; and (3) $57,000,000 (HB476_HD1_HSCR498_.htm.txt) for fiscal year 2027. [4]",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "Your Committee has amended this measure by changing the effective date to July 1, 3000, to encourage further discussion. [4] As a result, this measure will have no fiscal implications within the next six years. [3] The Committee provided revenue estimates from 2021 as a reference for the potential fiscal impact if the measure were to become effective. [4] These estimates project revenue generation of $53,700,000 (HB476_HD1_HSCR498_.htm.txt) for fiscal year 2025. [4] The estimate for fiscal year 2026 is $55,500,000 (HB476_HD1_HSCR498_.htm.txt). [4] For fiscal year 2027, the estimated revenue is $57,000,000 (HB476_HD1_HSCR498_.htm.txt). [4] These figures are for reference only and do not represent actual fiscal impacts due to the amended effective date. [4]",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "Due to the amended effective date of July 1, 3000, this measure will have no impact on the State's operating revenue in the foreseeable future. [3] However, the Committee provided reference estimates of potential revenue that would be generated. [4] These estimates were $53,700,000 (HB476_HD1_HSCR498_.htm.txt) for fiscal year 2025, $55,500,000 (HB476_HD1_HSCR498_.htm.txt) for fiscal year 2026, and $57,000,000 (HB476_HD1_HSCR498_.htm.txt) for fiscal year 2027. [4]",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "This measure does not involve any capital expenditures. [4] The provided documents contain no provisions for investments in facilities, equipment, or technology infrastructure. [3] This remains unchanged from the previous fiscal note. [4]",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "This Act shall take effect on July 1, 3000. [3] Therefore, there are no fiscal implications for the period immediately following the next six years. [3] The fiscal implications detailed in the referenced revenue estimates would only begin after the effective date. [4]",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The primary update from the previous fiscal note is the amendment changing the bill's effective date to July 1, 3000, which postpones any fiscal impact indefinitely. [4] The new fiscal note includes potential revenue estimates provided by the committee as a reference, which were absent previously; these estimates project revenue of $53,700,000 (HB476_HD1_HSCR498_.htm.txt) in fiscal year 2025, increasing to $57,000,000 (HB476_HD1_HSCR498_.htm.txt) by fiscal year 2027. [4] This note also includes new context on the bill's purpose, citing the committee's finding that the measure addresses income inequality given that eighty percent of long-term capital gains are earned by taxpayers with incomes greater than $400,000 (HB476_HD1_HSCR498_.htm.txt). [4] Additionally, comments from the Department of Taxation regarding the implementation challenges of a mid-year effective date have been included. [2]"
