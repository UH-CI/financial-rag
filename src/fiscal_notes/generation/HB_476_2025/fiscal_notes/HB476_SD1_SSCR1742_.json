  "overview": "The purpose and intent of this measure is to amend the capital gains tax. [10] More specifically, this measure amends the capital gains tax rate for individuals, estates, and trusts from 7.25 per cent to an unspecified percentage, and amends the alternative capital gains tax rate for corporations from four per cent to an unspecified percentage. [10] This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2050, and shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024. [9]",
  "appropriations": "This measure does not contain an appropriation. [10] Revenue generated could support affordable housing, infrastructure, and essential public services—investments that improve quality of life and strengthen economic stability for working families. [8] In previous years, the Institute for Taxation and Economic Policy suggested that taxing capital gains at the same rate as ordinary income would bring in over $80 million (HB476_HD2_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-28-25_.PDF.txt) to state coffers. [8]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The bill includes unspecified tax rates and otherwise contains blanks for important information. [8] The bill cannot be scored for revenue gain/loss in its current form, and cannot be vetted properly unless numbers are inserted. [8] Your Committee has amended this measure by changing the effective date to July 1, 2050, to facilitate further discussion on the measure. [10]",
  "agency_impact": "The Department of Taxation (DOTAX) offered comments on H.B. 476, H.D. 2, which had a defective effective date of July 1, 3000. [8] DOTAX requested that the effective date of the bill be amended to apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024 (or to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025) to avoid the ambiguity and uncertainty that would arise from a change in tax rates in the middle of a taxable year. [8] Your Committee has amended this measure by changing the effective date to July 1, 2050, and specifying the taxable years to which the measure applies. [10]",
  "economic_impact": "Your Committee finds that the current tax code allows Hawaii taxpayers to either pay the top marginal rate of their income tax bracket or the capital gains rate of 7.25 per cent, whichever is lesser on capital gains. [10] As a result of Act 41, Session Laws of Hawaii 2024, the increases to the income tax brackets and decreases to the income tax rates allow taxpayers who earn less than $150,000 (HB476_SD1_SSCR1742_.htm.txt) to pay at the marginal rate, which will be lower than the current 7.25 per cent capital gains tax rate. [10] Therefore, any increases to the capital gains tax will not have a meaningful effect on the tax rates for working families, thus allaying any concerns that the measure would negatively impact working families. [10]",
  "policy_impact": "This measure amends section 235-51(f), Hawaii Revised Statutes, which applies to individuals, estates, and trusts, and section 235-71.5 for the alternative tax for corporations. [9] [9] If a Committee on Conference is convened on this measure, your Committee respectfully requests that the Committee on Conference consider amending the capital gains tax rate for individuals, estates, and trusts from 7.25 per cent to eight per cent. [10] The effective date has been changed to July 1, 2050, to facilitate further discussion. [10]",
  "revenue_sources": "The bill cannot be scored for revenue gain/loss in its current form because it includes unspecified tax rates. [8] Proponents suggest that taxing capital gains at the same rate as ordinary income could bring in tens of millions of dollars in new revenue. [8] Testimony from the Democratic Party of Hawaiʻi Education Caucus notes that in previous years, it was suggested that taxing capital gains at the same rate as ordinary income would bring in over $80 million (HB476_HD2_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-28-25_.PDF.txt) to state coffers. [8]",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2050, and shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024. [9] As such, there are no fiscal implications within the next six fiscal years. [9] The bill includes unspecified tax rates and otherwise contains blanks for important information, and cannot be scored for revenue gain/loss in its current form. [8] We assume that a tax rate increase is intended. [8] A tax increase of any magnitude in Hawaii’s fragile economy will, no doubt, have a negative impact as costs soar due to higher taxes. [8] As costs and overhead increase, employers must find ways to stay in business by either increasing prices to their customers or cut back on costs. [8] This may take the form of reducing inventory, shortening business hours, reducing employee hours, or even laying off workers. [8] A tax increase of any magnitude would send many companies, especially smaller ones, out of business taking with them the jobs the community so desperately needs at this time. [8] Testimony suggests that for those who made more than $400,000 (HB476_HD2_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-28-25_.PDF.txt) a year in 2022, long-term capital gains were 21% of the total taxable income of residents. [8]",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "Because this Act shall take effect on July 1, 2050, there will be no impact on operating revenue in the foreseeable future. [9] The bill cannot be scored for revenue gain/loss in its current form as the tax rates are unspecified. [8] A study from the Congressional Budget Office on how taxes affect the decision to realize gains concluded that such decisions are very responsive to changes in taxation, which could affect future revenue projections. [8]",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "This measure does not involve any capital expenditures. [9] The bill amends tax statutes and does not contain provisions for investments in facilities, equipment, or technology infrastructure. [9] This section remains unchanged from the previous fiscal note. [9]",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2050. [9] Therefore, there are no fiscal implications for the period immediately following the next six years. [9] Any long-term fiscal impact is contingent on the unspecified percentages for the tax rates being defined in future legislation. [10]",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The primary update from the previous fiscal note is the change in the measure's effective date from July 1, 3000 to July 1, 2050, to facilitate further discussion. [10] While the capital gains tax rates remain unspecified, the Committee on Ways and Means requests that a Committee on Conference consider amending the rate for individuals, estates, and trusts to eight per cent. [10] New analysis finds that as a result of Act 41, Session Laws of Hawaii 2024, taxpayers who earn less than $150,000 (HB476_SD1_SSCR1742_.htm.txt) will pay at a marginal rate lower than the current 7.25 per cent capital gains tax rate, meaning increases to the capital gains tax will not have a meaningful effect on these working families. [10] [10] Consequently, the six-year revenue projections referenced in the previous note, which were based on specific rate increases, are no longer applicable as the bill cannot be scored in its current form.
