Honolulu,
Hawaii
RE:
H.B. No. 476
H.D. 2
S.D. 1
Honorable Ronald D. Kouchi
President of the Senate
Thirty-Third State Legislature
Regular Session of 2025
State of Hawaii
Sir:
Your Committee on
Ways and Means, to which was referred H.B. No. 476, H.D. 2, entitled:
"A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO CAPITAL GAINS
TAX,"
begs leave to report as follows:
The
purpose and intent of this measure is to amend the capital gains tax.
More
specifically, this measure:
(1)
Amends the capital gains tax rate for
individuals, estates, and trusts from 7.25 per cent to an unspecified
percentage; and
(2)
Amends the alternative capital gains tax rate
for corporations from four per cent to an unspecified percentage.
Your Committee
received testimony in support of this measure from Activities and Attractions
Association of Hawaii, Inc.; Democratic Party of Hawaii Education Caucus; Hawaii
Alliance for Progressive Action; Hawaii Appleseed Center for Law and Economic
Justice; Hawaii Children's Action Network Speaks!; Hawaii State AFL-CIO; League
of Women Voters of Hawaii; and fifteen individuals.
Your Committee
received testimony in opposition to this measure from The Chamber of Commerce
Hawaii, Grassroot Institute of Hawaii, Hawaii Association of REALTORS, Hawaii
Patriot Republicans, Maui Chamber of Commerce, and numerous individuals.
Your Committee
received comments on this measure from the Department of Taxation, Hawaii Food
Industry Association, and Tax Foundation of Hawaii.
Your Committee
finds that the current tax code allows Hawaii taxpayers to either pay the top
marginal rate of their income tax bracket or the capital gains rate of 7.25 per
cent, whichever is lesser on capital gains.
As a result of Act 41, Session Laws of Hawaii 2024, the increases to the
income tax brackets and decreases to the income tax rates allow taxpayers who
earn less than $150,000 to pay at the marginal rate, which will be lower than
the current 7.25 per cent capital gains tax rate.
Therefore, any increases to the capital gains
tax will not have a meaningful effect on the tax rates for working families,
thus allaying any concerns that the measure would negatively impact working families.
If a Committee on
Conference is convened on this measure, your Committee respectfully requests
that the Committee on Conference consider amending the capital gains tax rate
for individuals, estates, and trusts from 7.25 per cent to eight per cent.
Your Committee has
amended this measure by:
(1)
Changing the effective date to July 1, 2050,
to facilitate further discussion on the measure; and
(2)
Specifying the taxable years to which the
measure applies.
As affirmed by the
record of votes of the members of your Committee on Ways and Means that is
attached to this report, your Committee is in accord with the intent and
purpose of H.B. No. 476, H.D. 2, as amended herein, and recommends
that it pass Second Reading in the form attached hereto as H.B. No. 476,
H.D. 2, S.D. 1, and be placed on the calendar for Third Reading.
Respectfully submitted on behalf
of the members of the Committee on Ways and Means,
