The Department of Taxation (DOTAX) offers the following comments regarding 
H.B. 476, H.D. 1, for your consideration. 
 
H.B. 476, H.D. 1, amends section 235-51(f), Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS), by 
increasing the capital gains tax rate for individuals, estates, and trusts from 7.25 percent 
to 9 percent, and amends section 235-71.5(2)(B), HRS, by increasing the alternative 
capital gains tax for corporations from 4 percent to 5 per cent. The bill has a defective 
effective date of July 1, 3000. 
 
DOTAX requests that the effective date of the bill be amended to apply to taxable 
years beginning after December 31, 2024 (or to taxable years beginning after December 
31, 2025) to avoid the ambiguity and uncertainty that would arise from a change in tax 
rates in the middle of a taxable year.

Dear Chair Yamashita, Vice Chair Takenouchi, and Committee Members,  
 
On behalf of Hawai‘i Children’s Action Network Speaks!, I am writing in SUPPORT with suggested 
amendments to HB 476 HD1. This bill Increases the capital gains tax rate for individuals, estates, and 
trusts to nine percent. Increases the alternative capital gains tax for corporations to five percent. 
 
Hawaiʻi is one of only nine states that allows capital gains—profits from the sale of stocks, bonds, 
investment real estate, art, and antiques—to be taxed at a LOWER rate than ordinary working people’s 
income.1 This tax break benefits those at the top, including non-residents who profit from investing in 
real estate in Hawaiʻi.  
 
 
 
As the Hawai‘i Department of Taxation states, “The capital gains are heavily concentrated in the high 
end of the income distribution especially for nonresidents. The higher the income of taxpayers the 
greater the share of capital gains in their taxable income in general,”2 
 
For those who made more than $400,000 a year in 2022, long-term capital gains were 21% of the total 
taxable income of residents, and more than half (56%) the income of non-residents.3

Looking at the federal capital gains tax rates and real business investment over time, there is no 
relationship between taxing capital gains and investment levels.4 As Warren Buffett said, “I have 
worked with investors for 60 years and I have yet to see anyone -- not even when capital gains rates 
were 39.9 percent in 1976-77 -- shy away from a sensible investment because of the tax rate on the 
potential gain."5 
 
 
 
However, by raising the capital gains tax threshold from 7.25% to 9%, this bill would increase taxes on 
middle-income taxpayers who have capital gains, while still giving a tax break to those at the top. 
Instead, we suggest amending this bill to simply tax wealth at the same rate as work – by eliminating 
the capital gains tax loophole entirely, as proposed in SB349. 
 
Mahalo for this opportunity to provide testimony. Please pass this bill with our suggested amendments.

RE: House Bill 476, HD1, Relating to Capital Gains Tax 
 
HEARING: Monday, February 24, 2025, at 10:00 a.m. 
 
 
Aloha Chair Yamashita, Vice Chair Takenouchi, and Members of the Committee: 
 
My name is Lyndsey Garcia, Director of Advocacy, testifying on behalf of the 
Hawai‘i Association of REALTORS® (“HAR”), the voice of real estate in Hawaii and its 
over 10,000 members. HAR opposes House Bill 476, HD1, which increases the capital 
gains tax rate for individuals, estates, and trusts to nine percent. Increases the 
alternative capital gains tax for corporations to five percent.  Effective 7/1/3000. 
 
A capital gain happens when one sells an investment for a profit, such as stocks, 
real estate, or businesses.  Hawaii has the 10th highest capital gains tax rate of all 50 
states and D.C.1  Additionally, 7 states have no capital gains tax and Washington 
exempts real estate from capital gains taxation. 
 
We believe attracting capital into the state is a necessary and critical component 
to solving our housing crisis for both renters and buyers. Unlike the federal capital gains 
tax rates, Hawaii does not make a distinction between short-term and long-term gains. 
As such, a capital gains tax increase may act to discourage new capital investment 
coming into the State.  
 
Additionally, HAR believes that Hawaii’s capital gains rate should be taxed at a 
lower rate than ordinary income to both factor in inflation and because a lower rate 
would factor in the high amount of risk it takes to start a business or invest in the stock 
market, where one could also lose a lot of money.  Furthermore, the capital gains tax 
has a disproportionate impact on our kupuna who may want to sell and downsize to a 
smaller home where they can age in place or rely on their investments to convert their 
assets to spendable income during their retirement, such as for medical expenses or to 
move into a care home. 
 
Mahalo for the opportunity to provide testimony on this measure.

HOUSE BILL 476, HD1, RELATING TO CAPITAL GAINS TAX  
 
FEBRUARY 24, 2025 · FIN HEARING 
POSITION: Support with amendments.  
RATIONALE: The Democratic Party of Hawai’i Education Caucus supports and suggests 
amendments for HB 476, HD1, which increases the capital gains tax threshold to nine percent 
and increases the alternative capital gains tax for corporations to five percent. 
Public education is the heartbeat of our democracy and our economy. Historically, however, our 
public school system has been dramatically underfunded, leading to reconsideration of whether 
or not to continue successful learning programs. Arts, Hawaiian cultural, career and technical, 
foreign language, and 21st Century elective programs have been slashed to maintain an 
unsustainable testing regime.  
Unfortunately, when our state’s education budget fails to keep pace with inflation, successful 
learning centers and categorical programming get placed on the chopping block, while the DOE's 
priorities shift from classroom support to programmatic savings. Put simply, when we fail to 
adequately fund our schools, the DOE must spend more time accounting for basic programs, 
crowding out concerns about the efficient allocation of funds for individual teacher and student 
needs, special education, career and technical education, wraparound services, and essential 
supports like student transportation, school meals, and mental health programs.  

2 
 
 
Increasing the capital gains tax would generate much-needed revenue into our state, which would 
help remedy our longstanding public education funding crisis. It is time for the wealthy to pay their 
fair share for crucial public services.  
That said, we urge your committee to amend this measure to tax capital gains at the same 
rate as ordinary income, which the House passed last year in HB 1660. Hawaiʻi is one of only 
nine states that taxes all capital gains—profits from the sale of stocks, bonds, investment real 
estate, art, and antiques—at a lower rate than ordinary income. This capital gains tax loophole 
privileges almost entirely high-income taxpayers, including non-residents who profit from investing 
in real estate in the islands. Moreover, taxing capital gains at the same rate as ordinary income 
will ensure that low- and middle-income tax payers do not pay a capital gains rate that exceeds 
their income tax bracket, but is rather in accordance with their annual income level.  
If Hawai‘i were to tax capital gains at the same rates as regular income, as most states do, we 
could bring in tens of millions of dollars in new revenue, 97 percent of which would be paid 

3 
by the top 5 percent of income earners in our state. The bottom 80 percent would pay nothing at 
all. That money could be used to fund vital state priorities, such as public education, environmental 
preservation, health care, mental health services, transportation infrastructure, and the 
establishment of tax credits for those in need.  
In previous years, the Institute for Taxation and Economic Policy suggested that taxing capital 
gains at the same rate as ordinary income would bring in over $80 million to state coffers. Last 
year’s passage of a comprehensive tax cut–including for the wealthy–likely diminishes those 
numbers, but enacting this measure would still produce significant sums for important state 
priorities, including public education.  
We cannot give up the quest for a fully funded school system. Our keiki’s and our community’s 
future depends on our resolve.

Hawaiʿi Health & Harm Reduction Center (HHHRC) strongly supports HB 476, HD 1, 
which increases the capital gains tax rate for individuals, estates, and trusts to nine 
percent and increases the alternative capital gains tax for corporations to five percent.  
 
Hawaiʿi one of a small number of states that tax capital gains at lower rates than ordinary 
income. Lower taxation of profits that are realized by the sale of stocks, bonds, real estate, 
art, and antiques is a windfall for higher-income taxpayers, including non-residents who 
benefit from speculative real estate investments. This revenue is needed to help fund the 
ongoing critical needs of the state, including housing, education, health care, 
infrastructure, and programs to assist working families and others in need. 
 
HHHRC’s mission is to reduce harm, promote health, create wellness, and fight stigma in 
Hawaiʻi and the Pacific. We work with many individuals impacted by poverty, housing 
instability, and other social determinants of health. Many have behavioral health 
problems, including those related to substance use and mental health conditions, and 
have also been deeply impacted by trauma related to histories of physical, sexual, and 
psychological abuse.

SUBJECT: NET INCOME, Increase Maximum Capital Gains Tax Rate 
BILL NUMBER: HB 476 HD 1 
INTRODUCED BY: House Committee on Economic Development 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: Increases the maximum capital gains tax for individuals to 9%.  
Increases the maximum capital gains tax for corporations to 5%. 
SYNOPSIS:   Amends section 235-51(f), HRS, to increase the maximum capital gains rate for 
individuals from 7.25% to 9%. 
Amends section 235-71.5, HRS, to increase the maximum capital gains rate for corporations 
from 4% to 5%. 
EFFECTIVE DATE: July 1, 3000.  
STAFF COMMENTS:   Under current law, capital gains are taxed as income.  A capital gain is a 
profit from the sale of a capital asset—such as a house, stock, bond, or jewelry— from the time 
that asset is acquired until the time it is sold. The price at which an asset is purchased is called 
the asset’s “basis,” and taxpayers pay tax on the difference between an asset’s basis and its sales 
price when they sell, or realize, that capital gain. 
In the federal system, for capital gains realized on assets held for less than one year (short-term 
capital gains), taxpayers pay taxes according to their ordinary individual income tax rate, ranging 
from 10 percent to 37 percent. For assets held longer than one year (long-term capital gains), 
taxpayers pay a reduced tax rate, ranging from 0 percent to 20 percent, depending upon a 
taxpayer’s income. Individuals with Modified Adjusted Gross Income surpassing $200,000 
($250,000 for married couples) pay an additional 3.8 percent tax on net investment income. 
Also, when a person dies and leaves property to an heir, the basis of that property is increased to 
its fair market value. This “step-up in basis” means that any capital gains that occurred during 
the decedent’s life go untaxed. When the heir sells that property, any capital gains taxation will 
be assessed based on the heir’s new basis. Step-up in basis reduces the tax burden on transferred 
property, as the total value of transferred property is already taxed by the estate tax. 
Presently, capital gains income is taxable at the federal level and in all 41 states that also tax 
wage income. The federal government offers a lower rate for long-term capital gains but taxes 
short-term gains at the ordinary rate. States tend to tax capital gains at the ordinary rate. 
This proposal is still a tax increase on individuals and corporations.  It would also be a tax 
increase on small businesses, since 75% or so of small businesses are organized as partnerships, 

Re:  HB 476 HD 1 
Page 2 
LLCs taxed as sole proprietorships or partnerships, or S corporations; all of those business forms 
do not (yet) pay income tax at the entity level but its owners pay tax on their respective shares of 
the entity’s business, primarily at the individual level. 
A tax increase of any magnitude in Hawaii’s fragile economy will, no doubt, have a negative 
impact as costs soar due to higher taxes.  As costs and overhead increase, employers must find 
ways to stay in business by either increasing prices to their customers or cut back on costs.  This 
may take the form of reducing inventory, shortening business hours, reducing employee hours, or 
even laying off workers.  A tax increase of any magnitude would send many companies, 
especially smaller ones, out of business taking with them the jobs the community so desperately 
needs at this time.

RE: HB476 HD1 — RELATING TO CAPITAL GAINS TAX 
 
Aloha Chair Yamashita, Vice-Chair Takenouchi and other members of the Committee,  
 
The Grassroot Institute of Hawaii opposes HB476 HD1, which would increase the maximum capital gains tax 
rate for individuals from 7.25% to 9% and the capital gains tax rate for corporations from 4% to 5%.  
 
Hawaii is already ranked among the worst states in which to start a business,1 and we are concerned a higher 
capital gains tax could discourage business expansion and innovation.  
 
There are a number of sound fiscal reasons for taxing capital gains at a lower rate than income, if they are to 
be taxed at all.  
 
For one, it reflects the fact that capital gains are not indexed for inflation, thus the lower rate is intended to 
offset the fact that some portion of the gain represents inflation rather than real returns.2  
 
In addition, high capital gains taxes create a “lock in” effect in which investors delay the sale of investments in 
order to avoid tax repercussions. This reduces economic growth by discouraging diversification and the 
movement of capital within the state.3   
 
That is why higher tax rates on capital gains could have the unintended effect of driving down investment and 
entrepreneurship in Hawaii.

Curtis Dubay, chief economist at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, wrote in 2021: “The economic models and 
past history all reach the same conclusion: When you significantly increase taxes on capital gains you get 
significantly less capital investment.”4 
 
In other words, investors and entrepreneurs would be less likely to conduct business in Hawaii as an increase in 
the capital gains tax would contribute to Hawaii’s already poor business environment. 
 
A 2021 study by the Baker Institute noted that “two decades of relatively slow economic growth call for 
increased innovation and faster diffusion of new technology, but higher capital gains tax rates will reduce 
innovation and technology diffusion.”5  
 
Hawaii residents, of course, need more innovation, not less, to prosper.  
 
In addition, higher capital gains taxes can discourage savings. The national Tax Foundation wrote in 2019: 
“When multiple layers of tax apply to the same dollar, as is the case with capital gains, it distorts the choice 
between immediate consumption and saving, skewing it towards immediate consumption because the 
multiple layers reduce after-tax return to saving.”6 
 
In terms of generating tax revenues, a 2021 economic model from the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton 
School found that a proposed hike in the federal capital gains tax rate would actually produce less revenue, 
since investors would be more likely to hold onto their investments so their heirs would inherit them at death, 
thus avoiding the increased capital gains tax.7 
 
In fact, Hawaii legislators should be skeptical of optimistic tax revenue projections achieved via a capital gains 
tax hike. A study from the Congressional Budget Office on how taxes affect the decision to realize gains 
concluded that such decisions are very responsive to changes in taxation.  
 
The study found a persistent elasticity of -0.79,8 which means that a 10% cut in capital gains taxes would 
increase realizations by 7.9%. Thus, a cut in the capital gains tax would have minimal or even a positive effect 
on tax revenues.  
 
In fact, in 2007 the IRS collected $122 billion at a 15% capital gains tax rate compared to only $26.7 billion in 
2007 dollars at the 40% rate in 1977, 9 This was a significant increase even after adjusting for inflation and 
other relevant factors.

Conversely, an increase in the capital gains tax would net significantly less in tax revenues than what might be 
calculated from a static model.  
 
In short, Hawaii’s residents and businesses need a break from new taxes, tax increases, fees and surcharges. 
This is not the time to make Hawaii a more expensive place to live and do business.

Aloha Chair Yamashita and Committee Members, 
The Hawaiian Islands Republican Women stand in STRONG OPPOSITION TO HB476. 
It is fiscally and ethically irresponsible to increase the capital gains tax. This will place a 
significant tax burden on our residents and have a greater impact on future generations. 
How does this measure up to the headlines in June 2024 where Governor Josh Green signed the 
largest income tax cut in state history into law? The new law gave final approval to a measure 
that should deliver bigger paychecks for many of Hawaii’s working people as early as the 
beginning of next year. 
Please do the right thing by voting NO on HB476. 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify.

Dear Chair Yamashita, Vice Chair Takenouchi, and Members of the Committee, 
 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify on behalf of Hawaiʻi Appleseed in support of HB 476, 
which would raise the capital gains tax threshold to 9 percent and the alternative capital gains tax 
for corporations to 5 percent. 
 
Capital gains are the profits an individual earns by selling their assets, including stocks, bonds, 
art, and antiques. The maximum capital gains tax for the state is 7.25 percent, which is much 
lower than the top 11 percent tax rate on income from regular jobs. This loophole means that 
individuals in the upper income brackets receive preferential treatment—they pay a lower tax 
rate on their income from capital gains compared to low- to middle-income workers, who often 
cannot afford to buy a large amount of assets. 
 
For example, local taxpayers with incomes over $400,000 make around 33 percent of their 
taxable income through capital gains. In comparison, local taxpayers in the $40,000 to $50,000 
range earn just 0.7 percent of their taxable income through capital gains.1 
 
Hawaiʻi’s low capital gains tax gives the wealthy an unfair advantage over people with lower 
incomes. Just like the rest of us, the wealthy should pay their fair share of the taxes that support 
our state’s programs, infrastructure, and services. Raising the capital gains tax is an opportunity 
for Hawaiʻi to generate consistent revenue by targeting high-income taxpayers, who can easily 
afford to pay more in taxes. 
 
Raising the capital gains rate is a step in the right direction. This increase would mainly affect 
wealthy individuals who can afford to pay higher taxes. In fact, 80 percent of all the long-term 
capital gains in Hawaiʻi are earned by the wealthiest group of taxpayers—those who have 
incomes of at least $400,000.

This bill would boost funding for our schools, infrastructure, government assistance programs, 
and affordable housing that Hawaiʻi’s residents need to thrive.  
 
In the long term, we would also encourage legislators to look at taxing capital gains at the same 
rate as ordinary income. This would completely eliminate the capital gains loophole, while 
generating even more tax revenue for the state.  
 
Mahalo for your consideration.

February 24,2025
TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF H8476 HD]. - RELATING TO CAPITAL GAINS TAX
Chair Yamashita, Vice Chair Takenouchi, and members of the committee:
The Hawaii State AFL-CIO is a state federation of 76 affiliate labor organizations representing
over 69,000 union members across Hawaii in industries including healthcare, construction,
hospitality, entertainment, transportation, and government. The AFL-ClO serves its affiliates by
advocating for the rights of working families, promoting fair wages, ensuring safe working
conditions, and supporting policies that strengthen Hawaii's workforce.
We are in support of H8476 HD1, which increases the capital gains tax threshold to nine percent
for individuals and raises the alternative capital gains tax for corporations to five percent.
Hawaii's current capital gains tax structure disproportionately benefits wealthier individuals and
corporations, exacerbating income inequality across the state. This measure will help create a
more equitable tax system by ensuring that capital gains are taxed at a level closer to ordinary
income, which is how most working families' earnings are taxed.
Revenue generated from this adjustment could be used to support essential services, invest in
affordable housing, or improve infrastructure, benefiting residents and strengthening Hawaii's
economy. Working families rely on these services to maintain their quality of life, and a fairer tax
system ensures those who benefit the most contribute their fair share.
This measure reflects Hawaii's commitment to addressing economic inequality and fostering a
tax system that supports working families and the broader community.

First you giveth away, and now you take away. Last year taxpayers were gifted with tax 
reductions. Now you want to increase some taxes. Nothing like bait and switch. Shame on you 
and especially my representative, Daniel Holt, who is one of the introducers. Many of us buy and 
sell securities to earn a profit, which helps pay our daily living expenses. It is not only the rich 
who take advantage of capital gains. Please put a stop to this today by deferring this ill advised 
bill. 
The Economic Development & Technology Committee Report, dated Feb. 12, 2025, says in part, 
“Your Committee finds that eighty percent of all long-term capital gains in the State are earned 
by the wealthiest group of taxpayers, who have incomes greater than $400,000, exacerbating the 
State’s income inequality.” The remaining 20% have a lower income. That being said, to protect 
the remaining 20% who use the capital gains to everyday expenses, and increase should apply 
only to those earning greater than $400,000. 
The federal government offers a lower rate for long-term capital gains. Hawaii should too.

Any slight capital gains break (such as a lower long-term investment rate) I may get is the 
*ONLY* tax benefit I have besides the Standard Deduction.    
After serveral years of submitting testimony for literally hundreds of bills that will help everyone 
but myself this really smarts.    Excuse the harshness but poorer people get dozens of beneficial 
programs and homeowners get 'rich people welfare' of  house-related tax deductions.  As an in-
betweener economically, I don't benefit from any of these and likely already pay more taxes than 
most of the people I know.  
Lastly: Individuals and corporations in the same bill??  This is too all-encompassing.   New bills 
can be submitted in future years for each of the tax categories specified.  
Thank you for the opportunity to rant.  This issue means a lot to me.

Many local people are moving away due to cost of living. Increasing capital gains tax on estates 
and trust to 9 % will have an impact. Many local residents their home is where family lived for 
awhile. The family may not have money to pay the capital gains tax for the estate or trust.  
Gov Green wants to looks to keep local people in Hawaii vs moving away. The increase to 9% is 
too high for an individual family and will cause hardship.

Investors, homeowners, and businesses with capital gains will pay higher state taxes on their 
profits. This will inturn make business less incentivize to invest in hawaii compare to other 
states. Businesses do not operate in a fantasy land where taxing them somehow makes them less 
greedy. In reality, these tax increases will be passed on to consumers and will discourage 
investment. A capital gains or corporate tax increase is one of the worst decisions a state can 
make because it makes no economic sense. Punishing businesses for creating capital and 
reinvesting in growth only discourages innovation, expansion, and job creation. I do not want 
hawaii to turn into the next California. Studies have shown that higher capital gains taxes 
discourage investment, as they increase the cost of capital and reducing the return on 
investments. Look at Texas; where in 2010 to 2019, more than 25,000 establishments moved to 
Texas, bringing over 281,000 jobs. Notably, California was a major 
contributor https://www.texastribune.org/2024/02/02/texas-relocating-businesses-jobs  
 
Hawaii should not follow in California’s footsteps. Instead of raising capital gains taxes, which 
will only drive investment away, we should focus on driving investment in like Texas.

Hawaii has one of the worst small business climates in America.  Our income tax rate is one of 
the highest in the nation.  It will take several years for last year's cut to take effect, and you are 
already trying to raise taxes in other ways.  
You should be lowering taxes, not raising them.

Comments:  
Dear Members of the Hawaii State Legislature, 
I write in vehement opposition to H.B. No. 476, which raises the capital gains tax from 7.25% to 
9% for individuals, estates, and trusts, and from 4% to 5% for corporations. This tax hike is an 
unacceptable burden on Hawaii’s residents and businesses, especially given the State’s well-
documented history of corruption and mismanagement. Nobody wants to pay more to fund a 
government that can’t be trusted. Below are the facts proving this bill must be rejected: 
• 
Taxpayers Already Overburdened: 
o Hawaii’s current 7.25% capital gains tax is the highest state rate in the U.S. (Tax 
Foundation, 2024), compared to the national average of 5.4%. Raising it to 9% 
would widen this gap, piling onto a 4.4% general excise tax—also among the 
nation’s steepest (DBEDT, 2023). 
o Residents face a cost of living 92% above the U.S. average (Council for 
Community and Economic Research, 2024), with median household income 
($83,000, U.S. Census 2023) barely keeping pace. A 24% tax increase (7.25% to 
9%) on gains squeezes families and investors already stretched thin. 
• 
Government Corruption Wastes Funds: 
o In 2023, Hawaii ranked 8th worst in the U.S. for public corruption convictions per 
capita (DOJ Public Integrity Section), with 12 officials indicted since 2020, 
including a $2 million bribery scandal in Honolulu’s permitting office (Hawaii 
News Now, 2022). 
o The State Auditor’s 2023 report flagged $350 million in “questionable” 
expenditures across agencies, yet H.B. 476 offers no accountability measures—
just more money for a leaky system. Why should we trust this revenue won’t 
vanish into corrupt hands? 
• 
Economic Damage Proven by Data: 
o States raising capital gains taxes see investment flight: California’s 13.3% rate 
drove a 15% drop in venture capital deals (NVCA, 2023), while Texas (0% rate) 
grew 20% in the same period. Hawaii, with $1.8 billion in annual capital 
investments (DBEDT, 2024), risks losing 10-15%—or $180-$270 million—if this 
passes. 
o Small businesses, 99% of Hawaii’s firms (SBA, 2023), rely on capital gains for 
reinvestment. A 25% corporate tax hike (4% to 5%) could cut their growth funds 

by $50 million statewide (extrapolated from IRS data), killing jobs—7,000 were 
lost after the 2018 tax tweaks (BLS). 
• 
Public Opposition is Overwhelming: 
o A 2024 Hawaii Poll found 68% of residents oppose tax increases, citing distrust in 
government (Honolulu Star-Advertiser). After the $10 billion HART rail fiasco—
$4 billion over budget due to mismanagement (GAO, 2023)—81% said “no more 
taxes without reform.” 
o Nationally, 62% of Americans reject capital gains hikes when corruption is a 
factor (Pew Research, 2023). Hawaii’s people won’t stomach this—especially 
with no sunset clause or oversight in H.B. 476. 
• 
No Justification, Just Greed: 
o The bill lacks a fiscal note or revenue goal—unlike S.B. 933’s clear $5 million 
aim (2025 session). Hawaii’s $10 billion general fund (DBF, FY 2024) grew 8% 
last year without this tax. Why the grab when 20% of 2023’s budget ($2 billion) 
went unspent or misallocated (State Auditor)? 
o Corporate tax revenue already rose 12% ($300 million) from 2022-2023 (TAX 
Dept.). A 5% rate isn’t “alternative”—it’s a cash cow for a government that lost 
$1.5 million in a 2021 Medicaid fraud scheme (HHS-OIG). 
• 
Call to Kill It: 
o This isn’t about funding needs—it’s about feeding a corrupt machine. Reject H.B. 
No. 476 outright. If revenue’s the goal, audit the $350 million in waste first—
don’t tax us for your failures. The 3000 effective date is a typo or a joke; either 
way, it’s dead on arrival. 
I demand you vote no on this outrageous bill. Taxpayers won’t bankroll more corruption—fix 
the system before you dare ask for more. Mahalo for hearing me out; I expect your response and 
a commitment to stop this now. 
Sincerely, 
Master Shelby "Pikachu" Billionaire, HRM 
Kingdom of The Hawaiian Islands H.I.

I strongly oppose HB 476, HD 1 and it be deferred this session.  Hawai'i residents and businesses 
need a break from new taxes, tax increases, fees and surcharges.  
As legislators, are you mindful that we have more and more local families leaving Hawai'i in the 
past years to more affordable states?  The cost of living for residents and businesses are difficult 
already and to increase taxes is another factor that more will leave the islands. 
This bill will contribute to a further exodus of Hawai'i residents, their families and businesses to 
permanently close or not expand their business to hire more workers. Please reduce taxes, fees, 
and surcharges; if we truly want to stop the population drain and support businesses to consider 
opening up in Hawai'i to build our economy.   
Thank you for the opportunity to testify in strong opposition of HB 476, HD 1.

Comments:  
As a committed citizen grounded in the belief that government should serve all people—not just 
the well-connected—I submit this testimony in strong opposition to HB476. This bill raises the 
capital gains tax to 9% for individuals, estates, and trusts, and 5% for corporations, a move that 
threatens Hawaii’s economic stability and fairness for working families. From a perspective 
rooted in prosperity for all, I urge you—Republicans and Democrats alike—to VOTE NO. 
Here’s why this bill fails our state. 
This Tax Hike Hurts Working Families, Not Just the Rich 
The stated intent may be to target high earners, but raising the capital gains tax from 7.25% to 
9% for individuals hits more than Wall Street tycoons. Retirees depending on investment 
income, small business owners reinvesting profits, and middle-class families saving for college 
or a home will feel this pinch. Democrats, you’ve long championed the working class—why 
impose a tax that burdens seniors and small entrepreneurs already stretched thin by Hawaii’s 
high costs? This isn’t progressive; it’s regressive in disguise. 
It Stifles Job Creation and Economic Growth 
Increasing the corporate capital gains tax from 4% to 5% doesn’t just affect big corporations—it 
deters investment across the board. Businesses need capital to expand, hire, and raise wages. 
When we tax gains at higher rates, we shrink the pool of money available for those jobs—jobs 
Democrats fight to protect for union workers and underserved communities. Data backs this: 
after the 2017 federal tax cuts, U.S. unemployment dropped to 3.5% by 2019, with gains for 
minorities and low-income workers. Raising taxes now risks reversing that progress here in 
Hawaii. 
It Undermines Fairness by Driving Investment Away 
Democrats often push for equity, but this bill creates inequity between states. Hawaii’s new 9% 
and 5% rates will push investors to places like Texas (0% capital gains tax) or Nevada (no state 
income tax), where capital stays and grows. That exodus means less revenue for schools, 
healthcare, and infrastructure—priorities you care about. The Tax Foundation notes high-tax 
states lose taxable income over time; California saw $17 billion in adjusted gross income leave 
in 2020 alone. Why set Hawaii up for the same fate? 

It Ignores Proven Alternatives to Fund Our Needs 
We all want better services, but hiking capital gains taxes isn’t the only way. President Trump’s 
tax plan showed that lowering rates can boost revenue through growth—federal receipts rose 
10% from 2017 to 2019 despite cuts. Democrats, you’ve pushed for closing loopholes and taxing 
offshore wealth—why not target those instead of broadly punishing local investors? This bill 
takes the easy road, not the smart one, and risks shrinking the pie we all depend on. 
It Betrays Our Shared Goal of Prosperity for All 
Committee members, we may differ on politics, but we share a goal: a thriving Hawaii for 
everyone. This bill, with its 9% and 5% tax hikes, betrays that by choking investment, jobs, and 
fairness. Democrats, you’ve fought for economic justice—don’t let this bill undo that by harming 
the very people you aim to lift up. VOTE NO on HB476. Reject this shortsighted tax grab and 
choose a path that grows our economy, not one that shrinks it. Hawaii deserves better—for all of 
us.

I strongly oppose the passing of this bill. The proposition of this bill is a clear indication that our 
elected officials are more concerned at a lower tax percentage for corporations over individual 
citizens. If the percentages were at least equal, I stil would be reluctant to support the progress of 
this bill and I wouldn't have such a strong opinion. However, I think this is a move in the wrong 
direction and it should be halted. 
I strongly oppose this bill.

**Testimony in Opposition to HB476 – Relating to Capital Gains Tax**   
Aloha Honorable Members of the House of Representatives,   
I am writing to express my strong opposition to HB476, a bill that seeks to increase the capital 
gains tax rate for individuals, estates, and trusts from 7.25% to 9%, and the alternative capital 
gains tax for corporations from 4% to 5%. While I recognize the state’s need to generate 
revenue, this proposed tax increase would impose an undue burden on Hawaii’s residents, 
businesses, and economy, ultimately undermining the financial well-being of our communities 
and stifling economic growth. Below, I outline my concerns regarding this legislation. 
First, raising the capital gains tax would disproportionately affect small business owners, 
retirees, and middle-class families who rely on investment income to build wealth and secure 
their financial futures. In a state with one of the highest costs of living in the nation, many 
Hawaii residents already struggle to make ends meet. Increasing the tax on capital gains—a key 
source of income for those who sell property, invest in businesses, or save for retirement—would 
erode their ability to plan for the future. For example, a homeowner selling a modest property 
after years of ownership could face a significantly higher tax bill, reducing the funds available 
for relocation, healthcare, or other critical needs. 
Second, this tax hike risks deterring investment and economic development in Hawaii. 
Entrepreneurs and corporations play a vital role in creating jobs and driving innovation, yet the 
proposed increase in the corporate capital gains tax from 4% to 5% sends a discouraging signal 
to businesses considering expansion or relocation to our state. At a time when Hawaii’s economy 
is still recovering from the impacts of past challenges, such as the pandemic and inflation, we 
should be fostering an environment that attracts investment, not one that penalizes it. Higher 
taxes on capital gains could prompt investors to seek opportunities elsewhere, reducing the 
capital available for local projects and job creation. 
Third, the cumulative effect of this tax increase, alongside Hawaii’s already high tax burden, 
could exacerbate outmigration. Families and businesses may feel pressured to leave the state in 
search of more favorable tax climates, a trend that has already strained our population and tax 
base. Retaining residents and encouraging economic participation should be a priority, and 
HB476 runs counter to that goal by adding yet another financial disincentive to staying in 
Hawaii.

Finally, while the bill’s effective date of July 1, 3000, appears to render it symbolic or theoretical 
at this stage, its introduction signals a concerning appetite for higher taxes that could materialize 
sooner if left unchallenged. I urge the Legislature to reconsider this approach and explore 
alternative revenue strategies—such as improving tax compliance or incentivizing economic 
growth—that do not place additional pressure on Hawaii’s hardworking individuals and 
businesses. 
In conclusion, HB476’s proposed capital gains tax increases would harm Hawaii’s residents, 
stifle economic opportunity, and weaken our state’s competitiveness. I respectfully request that 
you vote against this bill and prioritize policies that support financial stability and growth for all 
who call Hawaii home. Mahalo for your time and consideration. 
Sincerely,   
Tiare Smith
