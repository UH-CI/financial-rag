Comments:  
Aloha, Chair and members of the Ways and Means Committee.   
I strongly urge you to vote NO on this extremely unpopular bill.  Raising the capital gains tax for 
individuals and corporations to an "unspecified amount" is unfair and will have a negative effect 
on businesses and investors.  Hawaii is already noted to be one of the worst states in which to 
start a business.  This bill will discourage business and entrepreneurship which are both greatly 
needed here.    
Do not discourage economic growth by passing this bill.  The unintended consequences will 
have negative effects for years to come.   
Thank you for your consideration.

The Department of Taxation (DOTAX) offers the following comments regarding 
H.B. 476, H.D. 2, for your consideration. 
 
H.B. 476, H.D. 2, amends section 235-51(f), Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS), by 
changing the capital gains tax rate for individuals, estates, and trusts from 7.25 percent 
to an unspecified percent, and amends section 235-71.5(2)(B), HRS, by changing the 
alternative capital gains tax for corporations from 4 percent to an unspecified percent. 
The bill has a defective effective date of July 1, 3000. 
 
DOTAX requests that the effective date of the bill be amended to apply to taxable 
years beginning after December 31, 2024 (or to taxable years beginning after December 
31, 2025) to avoid the ambiguity and uncertainty that would arise from a change in tax 
rates in the middle of a taxable year. 
 
Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on this measure.

RE: House Bill 476, HD2, Relating to Capital Gains Tax 
 
HEARING: Friday, March 28, 2025, at 10:00 a.m. 
 
 
Aloha Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki, and Members of the Committee: 
 
My name is Lyndsey Garcia, Director of Advocacy, testifying on behalf of the 
Hawai‘i Association of REALTORS® (“HAR”), the voice of real estate in Hawaii and its 
over 10,000 members. HAR opposes House Bill 476, HD2, which amends the capital 
gains tax rate for individuals, estates, and trusts.  Amends the alternative capital gains 
tax for corporations.  Effective 7/1/3000. 
 
A capital gain happens when one sells an investment for a profit, such as stocks, 
real estate, or businesses.  Hawaii has the 10th highest capital gains tax rate of all 50 
states and D.C.1  Additionally, 7 states have no capital gains tax and Washington 
exempts real estate from capital gains taxation. 
 
We believe attracting capital into the state is a necessary and critical component 
to solving our housing crisis for both renters and buyers. Unlike the federal capital gains 
tax rates, Hawaii does not make a distinction between short-term and long-term gains. 
As such, a capital gains tax increase may act to discourage new capital investment 
coming into the State.  
 
Additionally, HAR believes that Hawaii’s capital gains rate should be taxed at a 
lower rate than ordinary income to both factor in inflation and because a lower rate 
would factor in the high amount of risk it takes to start a business or invest in the stock 
market, where one could also lose a lot of money. Furthermore, the capital gains tax 
has a disproportionate impact on our kupuna who may want to sell and downsize to a 
smaller home where they can age in place or rely on their investments to convert their 
assets to spendable income during their retirement, such as for medical expenses or to 
move into a care home. 
 
Mahalo for the opportunity to provide testimony on this measure.

RE:  HB476 HD2 Relating to Capital Gains Tax 
Position: Comments 
 
The Hawaii Food Industry Association is comprised of two hundred member companies 
representing retailers, suppliers, producers, manufacturers and distributors of food and 
beverage related products in the State of Hawaii.   
HFIA is in has concerns about how this measure may impact local businesses. Hawaii 
already has an extremely high tax burden for businesses, one of the highest in the nation. 
At a time when we are trying to grow the local economy, support local businesses, 
encourage startups and local entrepreneurs, and create a more diverse and resilient 
economy for our state, increasing the tax burden on local businesses seems 
counterproductive.  
Hawaii businesses already face a range of challenges. In recent years we have seen 
many local businesses move production to the mainland, or close because it is simply too 
expensive to do business in Hawaii. We encourage the legislature to continue to support 
our local businesses and not increase their tax burden. We thank you for the opportunity 
to testify.

SUBJECT: NET INCOME, Increase Maximum Capital Gains Tax Rate 
BILL NUMBER: HB 476 HD 2 
INTRODUCED BY: House Committee on Finance 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: Amends the capital gains tax rate for individuals, estates, and trusts. 
Amends the alternative capital gains tax for corporations. 
SYNOPSIS:   Amends section 235-51(f), HRS, to increase the maximum capital gains rate for 
individuals from 7.25% to [unspecified] %. 
Amends section 235-71.5, HRS, to increase the maximum capital gains rate for corporations 
from 4% to [unspecified] %. 
EFFECTIVE DATE: July 1, 3000.  
STAFF COMMENTS:  The bill includes unspecified tax rates and otherwise contains blanks for 
important information. The bill cannot be scored for revenue gain/loss in its current form, and 
cannot be vetted properly unless numbers are inserted.  We assume that a tax rate increase is 
intended. 
Under current law, capital gains are taxed as income.  A capital gain is a profit from the sale of a 
capital asset—such as a house, stock, bond, or jewelry— from the time that asset is acquired 
until the time it is sold. The price at which an asset is purchased is called the asset’s “basis,” and 
taxpayers pay tax on the difference between an asset’s basis and its sales price when they sell, or 
realize, that capital gain. 
In the federal system, for capital gains realized on assets held for less than one year (short-term 
capital gains), taxpayers pay taxes according to their ordinary individual income tax rate, ranging 
from 10 percent to 37 percent. For assets held longer than one year (long-term capital gains), 
taxpayers pay a reduced tax rate, ranging from 0 percent to 20 percent, depending upon a 
taxpayer’s income. Individuals with Modified Adjusted Gross Income surpassing $200,000 
($250,000 for married couples) pay an additional 3.8 percent tax on net investment income. 
Also, when a person dies and leaves property to an heir, the basis of that property is increased to 
its fair market value. This “step-up in basis” means that any capital gains that occurred during 
the decedent’s life go untaxed. When the heir sells that property, any capital gains taxation will 
be assessed based on the heir’s new basis. Step-up in basis reduces the tax burden on transferred 
property, as the total value of transferred property is already taxed by the estate tax. 

Re:  HB 476 HD 2 
Page 2 
Presently, capital gains income is taxable at the federal level and in all 41 states that also tax 
wage income. The federal government offers a lower rate for long-term capital gains but taxes 
short-term gains at the ordinary rate. States tend to tax capital gains at the ordinary rate. 
This proposal is still a tax increase on individuals and corporations.  It would also be a tax 
increase on small businesses, since 75% or so of small businesses are organized as partnerships, 
LLCs taxed as sole proprietorships or partnerships, or S corporations; all of those business forms 
do not (yet) pay income tax at the entity level but its owners pay tax on their respective shares of 
the entity’s business, primarily at the individual level. 
A tax increase of any magnitude in Hawaii’s fragile economy will, no doubt, have a negative 
impact as costs soar due to higher taxes.  As costs and overhead increase, employers must find 
ways to stay in business by either increasing prices to their customers or cut back on costs.  This 
may take the form of reducing inventory, shortening business hours, reducing employee hours, or 
even laying off workers.  A tax increase of any magnitude would send many companies, 
especially smaller ones, out of business taking with them the jobs the community so desperately 
needs at this time.

HB476 HD2 — RELATING TO CAPITAL GAINS TAX 
 
TESTIMONY 
Beppie Shapiro, Legislative Committee, League of Women Voters of Hawaii 
 
 
Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki, and Committee Members: 
 
The League of Women Voters of Hawaii supports HB476 HD2 which would 
increase the capital gains tax for individuals and corporations.  
 
The League of Women Voters believes that federal fiscal policy should provide for 
adequate and flexible funding of federal government programs through an equitable tax 
system that is progressive overall and that relies primarily on a broad-based income tax. 
The Hawaii State League supports applying these principles to State of Hawaii taxes. 
 
HB4762 was admirably written to address these objectives.  
 
Increasing the amount of money generated by taxing capital gains at the same rate as 
ordinary income would provide a substantial financial basis for a wide variety of 
purposes: addressing homelessness across all islands, increasing teachers’ and 
nurses’ salaries, preschool and childcare professional training and salaries, supporting 
local agriculture, re-building an economically just and thriving Lahaina, etc.  
 
The existing lower rates for taxing capital gains than rates for ordinary income is a 
notably regressive feature of our tax system. Taxing those gains at the same rate as 
ordinary income would make our tax system more progressive without any loss to at 
least 80% of our population. The tax would overwhelmingly be paid by our wealthier 
taxpayers: 97 percent of capital gains are earned by just the top 5 percent wealthiest 
residents in the state, those who can and should support community services where 
they live.  
 
Please pass HB4762 HD2 specifying the same percentage increases in capital 
gains tax for both individuals and corporations as provided in HB4762 originally

HOUSE BILL 476, HD2, RELATING TO CAPITAL GAINS TAX  
 
MARCH 28, 2025 · WAM HEARING 
POSITION: Support with amendments.  
RATIONALE: The Democratic Party of Hawai’i Education Caucus supports and suggests 
amendments for HB 476, HD2, which increases the capital gains tax threshold to nine percent 
and increases the alternative capital gains tax for corporations to five percent. 
Public education is the heartbeat of our democracy and our economy. Historically, however, our 
public school system has been dramatically underfunded, leading to reconsideration of whether 
or not to continue successful learning programs. Arts, Hawaiian cultural, career and technical, 
foreign language, and 21st Century elective programs have been slashed to maintain an 
unsustainable testing regime.  
Unfortunately, when our state’s education budget fails to keep pace with inflation, successful 
learning centers and categorical programming get placed on the chopping block, while the DOE's 
priorities shift from classroom support to programmatic savings. Put simply, when we fail to 
adequately fund our schools, the DOE must spend more time accounting for basic programs, 
crowding out concerns about the efficient allocation of funds for individual teacher and student 
needs, special education, career and technical education, wraparound services, and essential 
supports like student transportation, school meals, and mental health programs.  

2 
 
 
Increasing the capital gains tax would generate much-needed revenue into our state, which would 
help remedy our longstanding public education funding crisis. It is time for the wealthy to pay their 
fair share for crucial public services.  
That said, we urge your committee to amend this measure to tax capital gains at the same 
rate as ordinary income, which the House passed last year in HB 1660. Hawaiʻi is one of only 
nine states that taxes all capital gains—profits from the sale of stocks, bonds, investment real 
estate, art, and antiques—at a lower rate than ordinary income. This capital gains tax loophole 
privileges almost entirely high-income taxpayers, including non-residents who profit from investing 
in real estate in the islands. Moreover, taxing capital gains at the same rate as ordinary income 
will ensure that low- and middle-income tax payers do not pay a capital gains rate that exceeds 
their income tax bracket, but is rather in accordance with their annual income level.  
If Hawai‘i were to tax capital gains at the same rates as regular income, as most states do, we 
could bring in tens of millions of dollars in new revenue, 97 percent of which would be paid 

3 
by the top 5 percent of income earners in our state. The bottom 80 percent would pay nothing at 
all. That money could be used to fund vital state priorities, such as public education, environmental 
preservation, health care, mental health services, transportation infrastructure, and the 
establishment of tax credits for those in need.  
In previous years, the Institute for Taxation and Economic Policy suggested that taxing capital 
gains at the same rate as ordinary income would bring in over $80 million to state coffers. Last 
year’s passage of a comprehensive tax cut–including for the wealthy–likely diminishes those 
numbers, but enacting this measure would still produce significant sums for important state 
priorities, including public education.  
We cannot give up the quest for a fully funded school system. Our keiki’s and our community’s 
future depends on our resolve.

Conference Room 211 & Videoconference 
RE: HB476 HD2 Relating to Capital Gains Tax 
Aloha e Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki, and Members of the Committee:  
My name is Sherry Menor, President and CEO of the Chamber of Commerce Hawaii ("The 
Chamber"). The Chamber respectfully opposes House Bill 476 House Draft 2 (HB476 HD2), 
which amends the capital gains tax rate for individuals, estates, and trusts. Amends the 
alternative capital gains tax for corporations. 
 
There are significant concerns about both the proposed increases in the tax rate on net capital 
gains and the added provision in Section 1(a)(2)(E), which could intrude on an employer’s right 
to discipline employees. By removing the established upper limits and replacing them with 
higher, unspecified percentages, the measure creates uncertainty that discourages investment 
and hampers economic growth. Meanwhile, Section 1(a)(2)(E) would allow individuals who are 
suspended from work, yet still maintain an employer-employee relationship, to collect 
unemployment benefits for up to four consecutive weeks. This provision effectively penalizes 
employers who choose to suspend an employee for serious infractions—such as a safety 
violation or workplace misconduct—because it could entitle the suspended worker to 
unemployment benefits despite their misconduct. 
 
Beyond the immediate economic impact of the vague and potentially burdensome capital gains 
tax proposal, this additional unemployment benefit clause increases administrative complexity 
and encourages employers to terminate rather than suspend employees. Moreover, it blurs the 
line between appropriate disciplinary actions and state-sanctioned compensation, placing 
unnecessary strain on businesses and potentially conflicting with established safety standards. 
Taken together, these changes reduce Hawaii’s competitiveness, introduce further cost 
uncertainties, and undermine the ability of businesses to manage their workforce responsibly. 
For these reasons, the Chamber respectfully opposes this measure, as it threatens to stifle 
investment, slow economic growth, and weaken the State’s overall business climate. 
 
The Chamber of Commerce Hawaii is the state’s leading business advocacy organization, 
dedicated to improving Hawaii’s economy and securing Hawaii’s future for growth and 
opportunity. Our mission is to foster a vibrant economic climate. As such, we support initiatives 
and policies that align with the 2030 Blueprint for Hawaii that create opportunities to strengthen 
overall competitiveness, improve the quantity and skills of available workforce, diversify the 
economy, and build greater local wealth.  
 
We respectfully oppose House Bill 476 House Draft 2. Thank you for the opportunity to testify.

TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF HB476 HD2 - RELATING TO CAPITAL GAINS TAX 
 
Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki, and members of the committee: 
 
The Hawaii State AFL-CIO is a state federation of 76 affiliate labor organizations representing 
over 69,000 union members across Hawaii in industries including healthcare, construction, 
hospitality, entertainment, transportation, and government. The AFL-CIO serves its affiliates by 
advocating for the rights of working families, promoting fair wages, ensuring safe working 
conditions, and supporting policies that strengthen Hawaii's workforce. 
 
We support HB476 HD2, which raises the capital gains tax threshold for individuals and 
increases the alternative rate for corporations. Under current law, capital gains, such as profits 
from selling stocks, investment properties, or business interests, are taxed at lower rates than 
wages. This creates an imbalance where income from employment is often taxed more heavily 
than equivalent earnings from investments. A public school teacher can pay a higher tax rate on 
their salary than someone making the same amount through selling an investment property. 
 
Most working families do not earn income from capital gains. This adjustment applies primarily 
to individuals and corporations with significant investment income and does not raise taxes on 
wages or modest investment returns. 
 
This is a targeted correction, not a broad tax hike. It preserves protections for retirement 
accounts and small investors. Revenue generated could support affordable housing, 
infrastructure, and essential public services—investments that improve quality of life and 
strengthen economic stability for working families. 
 
We urge the committee to pass this measure. 
 
Respectfully submitted,

RE: HB476 HD2 — RELATING TO CAPITAL GAINS TAX 
 
Aloha Chair Dela Cruz, Vice-Chair Moriwaki and other members of the Committee,  
 
The Grassroot Institute of Hawaii opposes HB476 HD2, which would change the maximum capital gains tax 
rate for individuals from 7.25% to an unspecified amount, and change the capital gains tax rate for 
corporations from 4% also to an unspecified amount.  
 
The unspecified amounts originally were 9% and 5%, respectively, but the House Committee on Finance 
removed those figures from this bill, resulting in blanks for the proposed new tax rates. However, it is clear that 
the intention of the bill is to increase Hawaii’s capital gains tax rates.  
 
This is being proposed at a time when Hawaii is already ranked among the worst states in which to start a 
business,1 and we at the Grassroot Institute are concerned a higher capital gains tax could discourage business 
expansion and innovation.  
 
There are a number of sound fiscal reasons for taxing capital gains at a lower rate than income, if they are to 
be taxed at all.  
 
1 Adam McCann, “Best & Worst States to Start a Business (2025),” WalletHub, Jan. 20, 2025.

For one, it reflects the fact that capital gains are not indexed for inflation, thus the lower rate is intended to 
offset the fact that some portion of the gain represents inflation rather than real returns.2 
 
In addition, high capital gains taxes create a “lock in” effect in which investors delay the sale of investments in 
order to avoid tax repercussions. This reduces economic growth by discouraging diversification and the 
movement of capital within the state.3   
 
That is why higher tax rates on capital gains could have the unintended effect of driving down investment and 
entrepreneurship in Hawaii.  
 
Curtis Dubay, chief economist at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, wrote in 2021: “The economic models and 
past history all reach the same conclusion: When you significantly increase taxes on capital gains you get 
significantly less capital investment.”4 
 
In other words, investors and entrepreneurs would be less likely to conduct business in Hawaii as an increase in 
the capital gains tax would contribute to Hawaii’s already poor business environment. 
 
A 2021 study by the Baker Institute noted that “two decades of relatively slow economic growth call for 
increased innovation and faster diffusion of new technology, but higher capital gains tax rates will reduce 
innovation and technology diffusion.”5  
 
Hawaii residents, of course, need more innovation, not less, to prosper.  
 
In addition, higher capital gains taxes can discourage savings. The national Tax Foundation wrote in 2019: 
“When multiple layers of tax apply to the same dollar, as is the case with capital gains, it distorts the choice 
between immediate consumption and saving, skewing it towards immediate consumption because the 
multiple layers reduce after-tax return to saving.”6 
 
In terms of generating tax revenues, a 2021 economic model from the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton 
School found that a proposed hike in the federal capital gains tax rate would actually produce less revenue, 
since investors would be more likely to hold onto their investments so their heirs would inherit them at death, 
thus avoiding the increased capital gains tax.7

In fact, Hawaii legislators should be skeptical of optimistic tax revenue projections achieved via a capital gains 
tax hike. A study from the Congressional Budget Office on how taxes affect the decision to realize gains 
concluded that such decisions are very responsive to changes in taxation.  
 
The study found a persistent elasticity of -0.79,8 which means that a 10% cut in capital gains taxes would 
increase realizations by 7.9%. Thus, a cut in the capital gains tax would have minimal or even a positive effect 
on tax revenues.  
 
In fact, in 2007 the IRS collected $122 billion at a 15% capital gains tax rate compared to only $26.7 billion in 
2007 dollars at the 40% rate in 1977, 9 This was a significant increase even after adjusting for inflation and 
other relevant factors.  
 
Conversely, an increase in the capital gains tax would net significantly less in tax revenues than what might be 
calculated from a static model.  
 
In short, Hawaii’s residents and businesses need a break from new taxes, tax increases, fees and surcharges. 
This is not the time to make Hawaii a more expensive place to live and do business.

Senate Committee on Ways & Means 
 
Hawai’i Alliance for Progressive Action (HAPA) Strongly Supports: HB476 HD2 
March 28th, 2025 at 10am; Conference Room 211 
 
Aloha Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki, and members of the committee, 
 
HAPA is testifying in strong support of HB476 HD2, which would increase the tax rate on 
capital gains to help fund our future. In its original form, HB476 proposed raising the maximum 
capital gains tax to 9 percent and the alternative capital gains tax for corporations to 5 percent. 
This change would help address the unfair tax advantages currently enjoyed by wealthy 
individuals. 
 
Capital gains are profits earned from selling assets like stocks, bonds, art, and antiques. 
Hawaiʻi’s current maximum capital gains tax rate is just 7.25 percent—much lower than the top 
11 percent tax rate on income from regular jobs. This creates a loophole that favors the 
high-income individuals who have the resources needed to begin with to buy and sell capital 
assets. 
 
These high income earners make up a large portion of their income from capital gains, 
which means they can end up paying a far lower overall tax rate than is appropriate for their 
income level. In some cases, they could end up paying a lower effective tax rate than low- and 
middle-income workers who earn their income through wages. The wealthiest taxpayers in 
Hawaiʻi earn 80 percent of all long-term capital gains in the state. Increasing the capital gains 
tax would ensure these wealthy individuals contribute more to support schools, infrastructure, 
affordable housing, and government assistance programs, all of which are essential to a 
healthy, functioning society that we can all enjoy and thrive within.  
 
The best policy would be to simply tax capital gains at the same progressive, marginal 
rates as the state taxes regular income from wages. This would completely close the loophole 
and would be the most fair way to go.  
 
Please support HB1325 HD1. Mahalo for your consideration.

Re: 
HB 476 HD2 – Relating to Capital Gains Tax 
 
Hawai‘i State Capitol & Via Videoconference 
 
March 28, 2025, 10:00 AM 
 
 
Dear Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki, and Committee Members,  
On behalf of Hawai‘i Children’s Action Network Speaks!, I am writing in SUPPORT with suggested 
amendments to HB 476 HD2 This bill increases the capital gains tax rate for individuals, estates, and 
trusts  as well as the alternative capital gains tax for corporations to unspecified percentages. 
 
Hawaiʻi is one of only nine states that has a capital gains tax loophole that allows the profits from the 
sale of stocks, bonds, investment real estate, art, and antiques—to be taxed at a LOWER rate than 
ordinary working people’s income.1 This benefits those at the top, including non-residents who profit 
from investing in real estate in Hawaiʻi.  
 
 
 
As the Hawai‘i Department of Taxation states, “The capital gains are heavily concentrated in the high 
end of the income distribution especially for nonresidents. The higher the income of taxpayers the 
greater the share of capital gains in their taxable income in general,”2 
 
For those who made more than $400,000 a year in 2022, long-term capital gains were 21% of the total 
taxable income of residents, and more than half (56%) the income of non-residents.3  
 
Looking at the federal capital gains tax rates and real business investment over time, there is no 
relationship between taxing capital gains and investment levels.4 As Warren Buffett said, “I have

worked with investors for 60 years and I have yet to see anyone -- not even when capital gains rates 
were 39.9 percent in 1976-77 -- shy away from a sensible investment because of the tax rate on the 
potential gain."5 
 
 
 
However, by raising the capital gains tax threshold to a flat percentage, this bill could increase taxes on 
middle-income taxpayers while preserving the loophole for those at the top. Instead, we suggest 
amending this bill to simply tax wealth at the same rate as work, as proposed in SB349 and suggested 
by the Department of Taxation during a prior session: “If the intent is to impose the ordinary rates on 
long-term capital gains, the Department recommends repealing the capital gains rate altogether..”6 
 
Mahalo for this opportunity to provide testimony. Please pass this bill with our suggested amendments.

HEARING BEFORE THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS 
HAWAII STATE CAPITOL, SENATE CONFERENCE ROOM 211 
Friday, March 28, 2025 AT 10:02 A.M. 
  
To The Honorable Senator Donovan M. Dela Cruz, Chair 
The Honorable Senator Sharon Y. Moriwaki, Vice Chair 
Members of the committee on Ways and Means 
 
OPPOSE HB476 HD2 RELATING TO CAPITAL GAINS TAX 
  
The Maui Chamber of Commerce OPPOSES HB476 HD2 which amends the capital gains tax 
rate for individuals, estates, and trusts; and amends the alternative capital gains tax for 
corporations. 
 
Businesses in Maui County are still grappling with the aftermath of the August 8 wildfires, 
compounded by a downturn in visitor arrivals and ongoing repayments of SBA loans from the 
COVID-19 pandemic. Many business owners are being forced to sell assets to keep their 
enterprises afloat. We are also aware of business owners who have had to sell their 
businesses as a last resort or upon retirement. Raising the capital gains tax will impact those 
who have built and sustained businesses, likely provided jobs to our residents, and contributed 
to our local economy. This bill would impose higher taxes at a time when these business 
owners are seeking to sell their investments and most need financial relief. 
 
For these reasons, we OPPOSE HB476 HD2. We appreciate the opportunity to provide 
testimony on this matter and ask that you please defer this bill.  
 
Sincerely, 
 
Pamela Tumpap 
President

Thank you for hearing HB476 HD2 which would increase the capital gains tax rate for 
individuals, estates, and trusts to nine percent and increases the alternative capital gains tax for 
corporations to five percent.  Hawaiʿi one of a small number of states that tax capital gains at 
lower rates than ordinary income.  Lower taxation of profits that are realized by the sale of 
stocks, bonds, real estate, art, and antiques is a windfall for higher-income taxpayers, including 
non-residents who benefit from speculative real estate investments. This revenue is needed to 
help fund the ongoing critical needs of the state and working families in Hawaii.

Aloha members of the Senate Committee on Ways and Means--Chair Dela Cruz and Vice Chair 
Moriwaki,  
I am writing to express my strong support for HB476--increasing the tax rate on capital gains to 
secure a brighter future for Hawai'i families. Adjustmenting the maximum capital gains tax to 9 
percent, and the corporate capital gains tax to 5 percent would help address the current tax 
advantages that disproportionately benefit the wealthiest individuals in the Hawaiian Kingdom. 
Capital gains are the profits earned from selling assets such as stocks, bonds, art, and antiques. 
Currently, Hawaiʻi’s maximum capital gains tax rate is just 7.25 percent, significantly lower than 
the top 11 percent rate applied to income earned from regular employment creating a deficit in 
redistributing value to the community. 
This discrepancy creates a loophole that benefits high-income individuals who have the means to 
invest in and trade capital assets. For many of these high earners, a large portion of their income 
comes from capital gains, allowing them to pay a much lower overall tax rate than they would if 
their income came from wages. In some cases, this means that wealthy individuals could end up 
paying a lower effective tax rate than low- and middle-income workers. 
The wealthiest taxpayers in Hawaiʻi disproportionately accounts for 80 percent of all long-term 
capital gains in the state. Increasing the capital gains tax would ensure that these individuals 
contribute more toward supporting critical services such as education, infrastructure, affordable 
housing, and government assistance programs—services that are essential for a healthy, thriving 
community. 
In a fair society and economy, capital gains should be taxed at the same progressive, marginal 
rates as income from wages. This approach would close the current loophole and be the most 
equitable solution for a sustainable Hawai'i. In one of the most critical and challenging times, our 
working class families and community members struggle to survive. We should strive for a 
strategy that creates a thriving lahui and empowers the everyday people. 
Mahalo for your time,  
Brianna B.

First you giveth away, and now you take away. Last year taxpayers were gifted with tax 
reductions. Now you want to increase some taxes. Nothing like bait and switch. Shame on you 
and especially my representative, Daniel Holt, who is one of the introducers. Many of us buy and 
sell securities to earn a profit, which helps pay our daily living expenses. It is not only the rich 
who take advantage of capital gains. Please put a stop to this today by deferring this ill advised 
bill.

The Economic Development & Technology Committee Report, dated Feb. 12, 2025, says in part, 
“Your Committee finds that eighty percent of all long-term capital gains in the State are earned 
by the wealthiest group of taxpayers, who have incomes greater than $400,000, exacerbating the 
State’s income inequality.” The remaining 20% have a lower income. That being said, to protect 
the remaining 20% who use the capital gains to everyday expenses, and increase should apply 
only to those earning greater than $400,000. 
There are many seniors and others who count on capital gains to pay our bills. We don’t earn 
$400,000, or $300,000, or $200,000, or even $100,000. This bill harms us, at a time when 
everyday expenses are increasing, and obtaining property, flood, and hurricane insurance at 
reasonable rates is very difficult.  Those of us in this category are not the so called wealthy 
oligarchs and it is irresponsible to include us in this category and penalize us. 
The federal government offers a lower rate for long-term capital gains. Hawaii should too.

Dear Chair and Members of the Committee, 
I am writing to strongly oppose House Bill 476, which proposes to raise Hawaii’s capital gains 
tax rate for individuals, estates, and trusts from 7.25% to 9%, among other provisions. While I 
understand that this bill is meant to address state revenue concerns, I believe it unfairly punishes 
hard-working, modest savers like myself, who are striving to build a better future through 
responsible saving and investing. 
I make less than $100,000 a year, and my lifestyle reflects my commitment to living within my 
means. I don’t take extravagant vacations, I don’t eat out regularly, and I pack lunch every day to 
work in order to save money. Instead of spending money on luxuries, I have made conscious 
decisions to invest in my future by purchasing a home and building an investment portfolio. 
These decisions were not made out of wealth, but out of careful planning, discipline, and a desire 
for long-term financial security. 
This bill, however, treats me as if I am part of the wealthy elite simply because I have learned 
how to save and invest. By increasing the capital gains tax rate, the state is effectively penalizing 
individuals like me—those who have worked hard to save, rather than spend, and who are not 
living a life of excess. This tax increase will disproportionately affect people who are not 
wealthy, but rather people who are trying to grow their wealth through the very savings and 
investments that this bill seeks to tax more heavily. 
The impact of this bill will not be felt by the wealthy who already have access to tax loopholes 
and ways to minimize their capital gains taxes. It will hurt middle-income individuals and 
families like mine who are doing everything we can to prepare for retirement, save for our 
children’s future, and contribute to our local economy. Raising the capital gains tax rate will only 
serve to discourage responsible saving and investing, which is the very thing that helps build 
long-term financial stability for people like me. 
I urge you to reconsider this bill and its impact on middle-class savers who are doing everything 
they can to improve their financial situation. Increasing the capital gains tax rate will not help 
those who truly need assistance—it will only hurt those who are making the sacrifices to build a 
secure future for themselves and their families. 
Thank you for your time and consideration. 

Sincerely, 
Jenny Caban

I strongly oppose HB 476, HD 2 and it be deferred this session. Hawai'i residents and businesses 
need a break from new taxes, tax increases, fees and surcharges.  We have seen proposed water, 
sewage costs, electricity, property taxes as well as experiencing increased food costs in recent 
months.   
As legislators, are you mindful that we have more and more local families leaving Hawai'i in the 
past years to more affordable states? The cost of living for residents and businesses are difficult 
already and to increase taxes is another factor that more will leave the islands. 
This bill will contribute to a further exodus of Hawai'i residents, their families and businesses to 
permanently close, not expand their business, reduce employee hours or cease to hire more 
workers. Please reduce taxes, fees, and surcharges instead.  This proposal is still a tax increase on 
individuals and businesses.   
Thank you for the opportunity to testify in strong opposition of HB 476, HD 2 and legislators, 
please vote NO on HB 476, HD 2.

Aloha, 
I am writing in opposition to HB476 that would increase capital gains tax for Hawaii residents.   
The cost of living in Hawaii is way too high and the only way for some of us to survive is to 
make additional income through capital gains.  This money is made through individuals taking 
risk with what little money they have and costs the State nothing.  In most all cases the State 
does not provide a service to support the making of captial gains so there is no reason for the 
State to request a tax increase.  In fact, there should be no captial gains tax at all because money 
is being made through individual investment that is in no way supported by the 
State.  Furthermore, the State should follow the lead of the Federal government and look at ways 
to reduce the tax burden on individuals.  It would be far better to increase the transient 
accomodation tax or tax tourism further in some way to generate income for the State rather than 
taxing residents. 
Please help residents further improve their quality of life by providing a tax free means to 
generate income through investment and capital gains and vote NO on  HB476. 
Mahalo for taking the time to review my testimony.

Capital gains are profits earned from selling assets like stocks, bonds, art, and antiques. 
Hawaiʻi’s current maximum capital gains tax rate is just 7.25 percent—much lower than the top 
11 percent tax rate on income from regular jobs. 
  
This creates a loophole that favors the high-income individuals who have the resources needed to 
begin with to buy and sell capital assets. 
These high income earners make up a large portion of their income from capital gains, which 
means they can end up paying a far lower overall tax rate than is appropriate for their income 
level. In some cases, they could end up paying a lower effective tax rate than low- and middle-
income workers who earn their income through wages. 
  
The wealthiest taxpayers in Hawaiʻi earn 80 percent of all long-term capital gains in the 
state. Increasing the capital gains tax would ensure these wealthy individuals contribute more to 
support schools, infrastructure, affordable housing, and government assistance programs, all of 
which are essential to a healthy, functioning society that we can all enjoy and thrive within.  
  

The best policy would be to simply tax capital gains at the same progressive, marginal rates as 
the state taxes regular income from wages. This would completely close the loophole and would 
be the most fair way to go.  
  
Mahalo for the opportunity to testify!

Written Testimony in Opposition to H.B. No. 476 – Relating to Capital Gains Tax 
Submitted to the Senate Committee on Ways and Means 
March 25, 2025 
Aloha Members of the Committee,  
As a committed resident of Hawaii and a supporter of the Republican vision of economic prosperity through 
limited government, I respectfully urge you to vote NO on H.B. No. 476, which raises capital gains taxes for 
individuals, estates, trusts, and corporations. While I acknowledge the intent to generate revenue, this bill 
threatens Hawaii’s economic vitality, undermines fairness, and risks alienating our state from national 
priorities. I present this testimony with diplomacy and objectivity, appealing to both my Republican peers 
and Democratic colleagues who value jobs, growth, and equity. Please consider the following points and 
reject this misguided legislation. 
1. Economic Growth Stifled by Higher Taxes 
Raising capital gains taxes, as implied by the amendments to Sections 235-51 and 235-71.5, will discourage 
investment in Hawaii at a time when our economy needs a boost. Capital gains taxes hit entrepreneurs, 
retirees, and small business owners who rely on investment income to fuel innovation and secure their 
futures. Increasing these rates sends a signal that Hawaii is hostile to wealth creation—a stance that 
contradicts the Republican emphasis on economic dynamism.  
Democrats, who often champion job creation, should note that investment drives employment. When Oregon 
raised its capital gains tax rate in 2010, a 2013 study by the Cascade Policy Institute found a 12% drop in 
venture capital investment over three years, costing the state an estimated 4,000 jobs. Hawaii, with its 
tourism-dependent economy still rebounding, cannot afford to lose jobs or scare off investors with this tax 
hike. 
2. Unfair Burden on Middle-Class Savers and Retirees 
Though framed as a revenue tool, this bill disproportionately harms middle-class families and retirees who 
depend on capital gains from modest investments—like selling a home or cashing out a small stock portfolio. 
Section 235-51(f) caps the tax rate on certain income but raises it on gains exceeding that threshold, 
effectively punishing those who’ve worked hard to build savings. This isn’t about taxing the ultra-wealthy; 
it’s about squeezing everyday Hawaiians.  
Democrats often advocate for tax fairness, yet this bill betrays that principle. In Minnesota, a 2013 capital 
gains tax increase led to a 7% decline in retirement account withdrawals as seniors delayed plans to avoid 
the higher rate, forcing many to stretch already tight budgets. Hawaii’s high cost of living amplifies this risk, 
threatening the financial security of our kupuna (elders)—a concern that should unite us across party lines. 
3. Defiance of the Trump Administration’s Tax-Cut Agenda 
The Trump administration has made tax reduction a cornerstone of its economic strategy. Former President 
Donald Trump declared, “We’re going to keep taxes low so Americans can keep more of their hard-earned 
money” (Campaign Rally, October 2024). H.B. 476’s tax increase directly defies this agenda, positioning 
Hawaii as an outlier at a time when alignment with federal policy could bring benefits like infrastructure 
grants or tourism promotion funds.  

Page 2 of 2 
When New York raised its capital gains tax in 2021 against federal guidance, the Trump administration’s 
Treasury Department signaled potential cuts to federal aid (Bloomberg, April 2021). Hawaii, reliant on 
federal dollars for disaster recovery and military bases, risks similar retaliation. Defying Trump’s tax-cut 
vision could cost our state dearly, a consequence neither Republicans nor Democrats should invite. 
4. Historical Evidence of Revenue Shortfalls and Flight of Wealth 
Raising capital gains taxes often fails to deliver promised revenue while driving wealth out of state. Investors 
and high earners can easily relocate or shift assets to avoid higher rates, leaving Hawaii with less taxable 
income overall. California’s 2012 capital gains tax hike, part of Proposition 30, saw a $6.8 billion revenue 
shortfall in its first year as wealthy residents moved to tax-friendly states like Nevada. Hawaii, an island 
with a captive but mobile population, could see similar capital flight to mainland jurisdictions, shrinking our 
tax base.  
Democrats who prioritize stable public funding should heed this lesson. A shrinking revenue pool means less 
money for schools, healthcare, and housing—priorities we all share. This bill gambles with our fiscal future, 
and history shows we’re likely to lose. 
5. Discouraging Business Innovation and Corporate Investment 
Section 235-71.5 increases the alternative tax on corporate capital gains, raising it from 4% to an 
unspecified higher rate. This penalizes businesses—especially small firms and startups—that rely on capital 
gains to reinvest in growth. In a state where entrepreneurship is key to diversifying beyond tourism, this 
tax hike stifles innovation. Trump’s Commerce Secretary pick, Wilbur Ross, argued, “Low taxes on businesses 
are the engine of American growth” (Fox Business Interview, December 2020). Hawaii’s defiance of this 
principle could deter federal incentives for local industries.  
Massachusetts saw this firsthand after a 2014 capital gains tax increase on corporations: a 5% drop in new 
business filings over two years, per state records. Democrats who support economic diversification should 
reject a policy that chokes Hawaii’s entrepreneurial spirit. 
Conclusion: Vote No for Prosperity, Fairness, and Unity 
H.B. No. 476 is a shortsighted tax grab that undermines Hawaii’s economic recovery, burdens our middle 
class, and risks federal backlash. It clashes with the Trump administration’s proven tax-cut agenda, which 
has lifted millions nationwide, while repeating mistakes other states have regretted. I respectfully urge you—
Republicans and Democrats alike—to vote NO and choose a path of prosperity, fairness, and unity. Let’s 
protect our families, encourage investment, and keep Hawaii strong in a competitive world. 
Sincerely, 
Andrew Crossland

A bill to hike capital gains tax sounds like a revenue grab, but it’s a bad move. First, it punishes 
investment—the engine of economic growth. People who risk their money in stocks, real estate, 
or startups drive jobs and innovation. Taxing their gains more heavily shrinks their incentive, so 
they’ll park cash in safer, less productive spots like bonds. Less investment, slower economy. 
Second, it hits the middle class harder than you’d think. The rich can dodge it with loopholes or 
offshore accounts—think tax havens or trusts. Meanwhile, regular folks selling a small business 
or a rental property get slammed. That’s not “soaking the rich”; it’s squeezing the aspiring. 
Third, it’s a timing disaster. Markets hate uncertainty, and a tax increase signals tighter wallets 
ahead. Investors sell off early to lock in lower rates, tanking stock prices and rattling confidence. 
Look at past hikes—1986, 2013—market dips followed. 
Sure, proponents say it funds social programs and narrows inequality. But the revenue often 
disappoints—people adapt, hide income, or just stop selling. And inequality? The ultra-wealthy 
don’t flinch; they’ve got lawyers for that. It’s a blunt tool that backfires, slowing growth while 
missing the target. Lower taxes, broader base—works better.

Aloha Chair and Committee Members, 
I am writing in strong opposition to HB476, which proposes an increase in capital gains tax rates. 
As a resident of Hawaiʻi and a member of the small business and investment community, I am 
deeply concerned about the negative impacts this bill would have on individuals, families, and 
the broader economy. 
Increasing capital gains taxes may appear to target only the wealthy, but in reality, it punishes a 
wide range of people—including retirees who depend on investment income, entrepreneurs who 
reinvest in local businesses, and individuals who have worked hard to build long-term savings. 
This bill discourages investment in Hawaiʻi at a time when we should be doing everything 
possible to attract and retain capital to support local economic recovery and job creation. 
Raising taxes on capital gains will not only reduce the incentive for investment but also make 
Hawaiʻi less competitive compared to other states. Investors and businesses may choose to move 
their resources elsewhere, leading to slower economic growth, fewer job opportunities, and a 
diminished tax base in the long run. 
I urge the committee to consider the broader implications of HB476 and vote against this bill. 
Let’s focus on policies that encourage innovation, investment, and economic resilience—not 
ones that deter progress and strain our communities. 
Mahalo for your time and consideration.

Vote NO on HB476. It's time to stop the endless taxation, especially when so many individuals, 
families, and small businesses are struggling to make ends meet. Hawai'i residents already face 
one of the highest tax burdens in the United States. Hawai'i cannot afford to become an even 
more expensive place to live and to do business. 
Don't be fooled; tax payers of all incomes pay capital-gains taxes, not just "the rich." Capital-
gains taxes are a drain on investment and serve as a dis-incentive to investing in companies. It is 
taxes like this that contribute to Hawai'i's low standing when evaluating the business 
environment. 
Over the past six years, Hawai’i’s population has been declining steadily, with tens of thousands 
of residents leaving to relocate in states like Washington, Nevada, Texas and Florida — states 
that do not have Hawai’i’s high tax burdens. Hawaii needs policies that foster economic growth, 
not policies that push people away. 
Please, kokua, vote NO on HB476.

I oppose HB476. This bill will increase home prices. As it is, homeowners pay exorbitant taxes 
when they go to sell their properties regardless of if it is your primary or investment ownership. 
Hawaii will have the highest tax rates in the country. When people do not sell our supply does 
not increase and our prices rise. If you want the price of homes to go down, increase the supply 
by lowering capital gains taxes, thereby encouraging people to sell. With increased sales at lower 
tax rates the state would actually make more money. By raising tax rates, you are stalling the 
housing market and icreasing the price of homes to Hawaiian families.

the highest in the nation. We don't need tax hikes that will make it even harder for residents to 
survive. Please vote against HB476. Mahalo for reading my testimony.

Comments:  
I oppose House Bill No. 476 because it creates unnecessary uncertainty, threatens to increase tax 
burdens unfairly, features an absurdly delayed effective date, perpetuates a convoluted corporate 
tax structure, and risks stifling economic growth in Hawaii. As a concerned individual who 
values clarity, equity, and economic vitality, I find this legislation deeply flawed and impractical. 
I’m troubled by the uncertainty this bill introduces with its unspecified capital gains tax rate for 
individuals, estates, and trusts. Removing the 7.25% cap without saying what replaces it leaves 
me—and anyone trying to plan their finances—guessing about what’s coming. If I were an 
investor or retiree counting on capital gains, I’d have no idea how to prepare, and that lack of 
transparency makes this feel like a reckless move that erodes trust in our tax system. 
The potential for a higher tax burden really bothers me too. If the new rate ends up above 7.25%, 
I can see it hitting people hard—especially folks like retirees or small investors who rely on 
selling assets to get by. I don’t think it’s right to squeeze more out of them without a clear 
reason, and it could make people think twice about selling property or stocks here, which isn’t 
good for anyone. 
Then there’s the effective date—July 1, 3000—which I can only assume is a mistake, but it’s still 
a problem as written. It makes me question the seriousness of this bill; if it’s not fixed, it’s just a 
waste of time that does nothing for years. I can’t support something so poorly thought out—it’s 
frustrating to see a law that’s dead on arrival until someone bothers to correct it. 
I also don’t like how this bill keeps a messy tax setup for corporations. That split between 3.08% 
for gains before April 1987 and 4% after feels outdated and fussy to me. If I were running a 
business, I’d hate dealing with extra paperwork over a distinction that barely matters anymore. 
It’s the kind of thing that makes me think this bill isn’t really simplifying anything—it’s just 
piling on more headaches. 
Finally, I worry this could hurt Hawaii’s economy. If capital gains taxes go up or stay unclear, I 
can see investors taking their money elsewhere. I don’t want to see less cash flowing into our 
markets or real estate because of this—it could slow things down when we need growth, not 
roadblocks. To me, this bill feels like it’s chasing revenue without caring about the fallout. 

In short, I think H.B. 476 is a sloppy, risky proposal—vague, potentially costly, oddly timed, 
needlessly complex, and bad for investment. I’d rather see it scrapped or rewritten to avoid these 
pitfalls than pushed through as is. It’s not what Hawaii needs.

I am submitting testimony in strong opposition to any tax increases, especially on capital gains

budget surplus, I don't think there is any need to raise taxes on residents who are already 
struggling with the high cost of living. Please focus on finding ways to lower costs instead.

Aloha Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki and members of the Senate Committee on Ways 
and Means: 
  
I am testifying in strong support of HB476, which would increase the tax rate on capital gains to 
help fund our future. In its original form, HB476 proposed raising the maximum capital gains tax 
to 9 percent and the alternative capital gains tax for corporations to 5 percent. This change would 
help address the unfair tax advantages currently enjoyed by wealthy individuals. 
  
Capital gains are profits earned from selling assets like stocks, bonds, art, and antiques. 
Hawaiʻi’s current maximum capital gains tax rate is just 7.25 percent—much lower than the top 
11 percent tax rate on income from regular jobs.  
  
This creates a loophole that favors the high-income individuals who have the resources needed to 
begin with to buy and sell capital assets.  
These high income earners make up a large portion of their income from capital gains, which 
means they can end up paying a far lower overall tax rate than is appropriate for their income 
level. In some cases, they could end up paying a lower effective tax rate than low- and middle-
income workers who earn their income through wages. 
  
The wealthiest taxpayers in Hawaiʻi earn 80 percent of all long-term capital gains in the state. 
Increasing the capital gains tax would ensure these wealthy individuals contribute more to 
support schools, infrastructure, affordable housing, and government assistance programs, all of 
which are essential to a healthy, functioning society that we can all enjoy and thrive within.  
  

The best policy would be to simply tax capital gains at the same progressive, marginal rates as 
the state taxes regular income from wages. This would completely close the loophole and would 
be the most fair way to go.  
  
Mahalo for the opportunity to testify!

Now is the time to improve the lives for the poorest of the community. We can achieve this 
through eliminating tax loopholes for the rich, who often pay next to nothing in taxes for the top 
earners.  
Our current minimum capital gains tax rate is just 7.25 percent—much lower than the top 11 
percent tax rate on income from regular jobs. 
This creates a loophole that favors the rich—folks who have the resources needed to begin with 
to buy and sell capital assets. The rich make up a large portion of their income from capital 
gains, which means they can pay a far lower overall tax rate than is appropriate for their income 
level. In some cases, they could end up paying a lower effective tax rate than low- and middle-
income workers who earn their income through wages! 
 
The wealthiest taxpayers in Hawaiʻi earn 80 percent of all long-term capital gains in the state. 
Rich people use the stock market to avoid paying taxes because they know in Hawai'i the capital 
gains tax is low. Now is the time to change the tax structure to improve the conditions of the 
poorest populations in Hawaii. Increasing the capital gains tax would ensure these wealthy 
individuals contribute more to support schools, infrastructure, affordable housing, and 
government assistance programs, all of which are essential to a healthy, functioning society that 
we can all enjoy and thrive within. 
 
We need raise this 7.25 percent in any amount that we can to make taxes in Hawai'i more even. 
This is overall an efficient way to decrease inequality, improve living conditions, house the 
poorest people, and strengthen our public programs. 
  
The best policy would be to simply tax capital gains at the same progressive, marginal rates as 
the state taxes regular income from wages. This would completely close the loophole and would 
be the most fair way to go. 
Mahalo, 
Marc Gamboa

I would like to testify in opposition to HB476. The people of Hawaii are already facing financial 
challenges due to the high cost of living. We should be trying to make it cheaper to live here, not 
more expensive. Please vote against this bill. Not everyone who invests and makes capital gains 
is rich. I am a retired teacher and have some investments and receive some capital gains. I should 
not be punished with an increase in taxation for doing smart investments. Actually, the State of 
Hawaii should not tax capital gains for retirees nor any elderly. Thank you .

Local residents have had enough. We already pay some of the most taxes in the country and I 
don't think it makes sense to continue to put the burden on us. HB476 will just further add more 
financial pressure on families and businesses. Please vote against this bill.

With Hawaii's budget surplus, there's no need for tax increases. I urge you to reject any proposals 
that would increase the tax burden on residents. The cost of living is already high, and more 
taxes will only make it worse. Plus, it certainly isn't going to ingratiate taxpayers toward re-
electing those responsible.

Aloha - I am testifying to express my concerns about House Bill 476. After the awesome tax bill

families here. I really hope that you vote against this bill. Our families and businesses are already 
struggling with the high cost of living. Increasing the tax rates will only make it more difficult to 
live and thrive here. Please find another way, and do it by not taxing us more. Mahalo!

I expect common sense to prevail and that you will vote against HB476 this year. Instead of 
raising taxes, a forensic audit of the Rail Transit System, DOE, and other duplicitous government 
services warrants immediate review and elimination.  That a legislative pay raise was passed 
when a tax increase is being considered suggests a blatant disregard for the People of Hawaii.

give them another reason to seek alternative States to live in, and deter those considering moving 
back or to Hawaii from doing so.  With one of the highest tax burdens in the US, coupled with 
our high cost of living, Hawaii is becoming less and less marketable to perspective employees 
looking to find a place to settle. 
Taxes like this will create flight of our talent, and we may.never get them back.

I graduated from Leilehua in 1972. My daughter graduated from Baldwin in 2000. She sadly

have to become more efficient in its use of taxpayer money like the other 49 states.  Hawaii state 
government and counties solutions to the problems are always increase the taxes on whatever the 
legislature can think of.. Take a stand and break this vicious cycle.

I am in strong opposition to the proposed HB476. Hawaii is already too expensive for most 
people to live here. Another tax increase will cause even more local residents to leave. Our state 
should focus on reducing the cost of living, not increasing it. 
Thank you for opposing HB476.

As someone who struggles with the high cost of living here, I urge you to oppose any tax hikes. I 
am a 32 year resident and single woman homeowner ready for retirement. Raising the capital 
gains tax rate would only make things more difficult for families trying to make ends meet. Due 
to the rising cost of an already high cost of living  this will be devastating and risk my ability to 
take care of myself in retirement. Please vote against HB476.

With Hawaii's budget surplus, there's no need for tax increases. I urge you to reject any proposals

I am in strong opposition to the proposed HB476. Our state should focus on reducing the cost of 
living, not increasing it.  The capital gains tax rate is already too high because it does not factor 
in the rate of inflation.  If an investment appreciates 5% a year and the rate of inflation is 2% a 
year, the real return is 3% but you are taxed on the 5%  per year appreciation.  A home purchased 
30 years ago has appreciated a lot but the purchasing power of the dollar has gone way 
down.   The sale of a property may happen only once or twice in a lifetime for many families and 
the capital gain tax hits them hard.

I would like to testify in opposition to HB476.  
A capital gains tax is essentially a tax on inflation. You get taxed because the dollar is worth 
less.  I know the legislature can't afford the programs it currently. It would be wiser to cut the 
programs, because increasing taxes will drive more people from Hawaii and make the revenue 
situation even worse.

A balanced budget has two sides - spending and intake.  It sure would be beneficial to the

Increqsing capital gains taxes is a terrible idea. As someone who struggles with the high cost of 
living here, I urge you to oppose any tax hikes. Raising the capital gains tax rate would only 
make things more difficult for families trying to make ends meet. My mother is trying to 
downsize by selling her house so she can move into a condo that is less physically and 
financially demending. As it is, she will be paying over $350,000 in capital gains taxes due to the 
crazy cost of real estate.  She will barely have enough money left to purchase a condo worth half 
the price of her home.  She is a sneior citizen, and capital gains are unfair as it is. Please vote 
against HB476.

gains tax would further discourage investment, penalize long-term savings, and make it even 
more difficult for local families and retirees to build financial security. 
Rather than raising taxes, I urge you to consider measures that support economic growth, 
investment, and local entrepreneurship especially during a time when many residents are still 
recovering from the economic impacts of recent years. 
Please vote no on HB 476. I appreciate your service to our community and your attention to this 
important matter. Mahalo!

I was so glad that you all passed that historic tax cut last year and I hope you do not raise taxes

As a retiree who is already facing the challenges of living on a fixed income, I am deeply 
concerned about the rising cost of living in our community. Every increase in expenses puts 
added strain on those of us who are simply trying to get by, and any additional tax burdens 
would only make our situation more difficult. I strongly urge you to oppose any proposed tax 
hikes, especially an increase in the capital gains tax rate. For many retirees like myself, 
investments represent a significant part of our financial stability. Raising the capital gains tax 
would directly impact our ability to cover basic necessities and maintain a modest quality of life. 
Please consider the financial realities faced by seniors and those on fixed incomes when making 
your decision. Please vote against HB476.

I urge you to oppose any tax hikes any tax hikes, for any year. What could possibly cause a 
person to want to put more tax on investment. This is almost as inane as GET on food and 
medical. Currently-8 states have it no income tax on long term capital gains (LTCG) and 32 have 
it the same as regular income tax. However when you look at these 32 states, the average total 
rate is 3.2%. Hawai'i is already at 7.25 for LTCG's. LTCG's is controllable by higher income 
people and they will change behaviors when/if you increase it. Lower income people will soon 
learn that the home investment profit ( LTCG's) is more and they will stop selling and start 
trading tax free. Too simple to defeat-trade for a Nevada property and then postpone sale until 
you no longer have a Hawaii liability, sic no profit on sold property, or other combinations. But 
what you need to do is for Hawaiians to make more investments and increase volume, not 
increase rates.

I strongly urge you to pass HB476. 
The wealthiest taxpayers in Hawaii earn 80 percent of all long-term capital gains in the state. 
Increasing the capital gains tax would ensure these wealthy individuals contribute more to 
support schools, infrastructure, affordable housing, and government assistance programs, all of 
which are essential to a healthy, functioning society that we can all enjoy and thrive within. 
Mahalo for your consideration.

TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION TO HB476 HD2 
RELATING TO CAPITAL GAINS TAX 
 
Aloha Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki, and Members of the Committee, 
My name is Teri Kia Savaiinaea, and I am submitting this testimony in strong opposition to 
HB476 HD2, relating to the Capital Gains Tax. While I understand the intent behind this bill 
is to increase state revenue, I believe this measure will have unintended consequences 
that disproportionately impact our local families, small businesses, and retirees. 
By amending the capital gains tax rates for individuals, estates, and trusts — as well as 
adjusting the alternative capital gains tax for corporations — this bill risks discouraging 
investment in our local economy. Many families on the Leeward coast and across Hawaiʻi 
rely on their investment returns to support retirement, pay for their children’s education, or 
build generational wealth. Increasing capital gains taxes places an additional burden on 
these individuals, making it harder for families to achieve financial security. 
Additionally, this measure threatens to deter small business owners and entrepreneurs 
who depend on reinvesting profits to sustain and grow their businesses. Raising taxes on 
their capital gains could suppress investment in new ventures, local job creation, and 
economic growth — outcomes that our community simply cannot afford. 
At a time when many Hawaiʻi residents are already struggling with the high cost of living, 
this bill risks further driving families away from our islands in search of more affordable 
opportunities elsewhere. Rather than imposing new financial burdens, I encourage this 
committee to explore alternative solutions that promote economic growth without 
penalizing individuals who are working hard to secure a better future for themselves and 
their families. 
I urge you to oppose HB476 HD2 and prioritize policies that support financial stability, 
investment, and long-term prosperity for all residents of Hawaiʻi. 
Mahalo for the opportunity to provide testimony. 
 
Sincerely, 
Teri Kia Savaiinaea 
Wai'anae resident, District 45

Aloha - I am testifying in strong opposition to HB576. Given our state budget surplus, there's no

Sometimes locals have a family property to sell, and increasing the capital gains hurts all of us. 
Please do a better job of budgeting our tax money that you collect instead of continuously raising 
our taxes.

Why are there never any proposals to streamline government, reduce wasteful spending, 
automate services. We are already priced out of paradise and Taxed to oblivion! 
With inflation and the high cost of living, any tax increases will make it even harder for families 
and businesses in Hawaii to survive. Please vote against any proposals to raise taxes. Mahalo for 
your consideration.

Aloha! As you well know, the cost of living in Hawaii is already one of the highest in the nation. 
We don't need tax hikes that will make it even harder for residents to survive. Please vote against 
HB476. Mahalo for reading my testimony. 
 

 
Dear Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki, and Members of the Committee, 
 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify on behalf of Hawaiʻi Appleseed in support of HB 476, 
which would raise the maximum capital gains tax rate and the alternative capital gains tax for 
corporations. 
 
Capital gains are the profits an individual earns by selling their assets, including stocks, bonds, 
art, and antiques. The maximum capital gains tax for the state is 7.25 percent, which is much 
lower than the top 11 percent tax rate on income from regular jobs. This loophole means that 
individuals in the upper income brackets receive preferential treatment—they pay a lower tax 
rate on their income from capital gains compared to low- to middle-income workers, who often 
cannot afford to buy a large amount of assets. 
 
For example, local taxpayers with incomes over $400,000 make around 33 percent of their 
taxable income through capital gains. In comparison, local taxpayers in the $40,000 to $50,000 
range earn just 0.7 percent of their taxable income through capital gains.1 
 
Hawaiʻi’s low capital gains tax gives the wealthy an unfair advantage over people with lower 
incomes. Just like the rest of us, the wealthy should pay their fair share of the taxes that support 
our state’s programs, infrastructure, and services. Raising the capital gains tax is an opportunity 
for Hawaiʻi to generate consistent revenue by targeting high-income taxpayers, who can easily 
afford to pay more in taxes. 
 
Raising the capital gains rate is a step in the right direction. This increase would mainly affect 
wealthy individuals who can afford to pay higher taxes. In fact, 80 percent of all the long-term 
capital gains in Hawaiʻi are earned by the wealthiest group of taxpayers—those who have 
incomes of at least $400,000.  
 
 
 
This bill would boost funding for our schools, infrastructure, government assistance programs, 
and affordable housing that Hawaiʻi’s residents need to thrive.

In the long term, we would also encourage legislators to look at taxing capital gains at the same 
rate as ordinary income. This would completely eliminate the capital gains loophole, while 
generating even more tax revenue for the state.  
 
Mahalo for your consideration.

Aloha - I am testifying in strong opposition to HB576. Given our state budget surplus, there's no 
need to raise taxes. The last thing we need to do is make it more expensive to live in Hawaii.  
Businesses will begin leaving or failing. Less jobs will be available, more families will leave 
their homes here for Nevada  
and other tax friendly states.  
Instead cut government expense and give the public tax refunds. Encourage them to stay here.

Aloha - I would like to submit testimony in strong opposition to HB476. This is not the time to 
raise taxes. Recently the cost of food and gasoline has skyrocketed which has put a tremendous 
financial burden on everyone. I am working with a realtor now to sell the only property I 
inherited from my parents because I need the money to pay for much needed maintenance on my 
house, and for my children's education costs As you already know, many families are struggling 
with the high cost of living in Hawaii and I don't think the legislature should be taxing us any 
more. Please do the right thing and kill this bill. Mahalo for your consideration.

We are all struggling with the high cost of living in Hawaii and I don't see how adding more 
taxes will make it any easier for us. I have worked my entire adult life in Hawaii making a living, 
saving, and managing to purchase living accommodation. At the same time securing my own 
retirement through various investing opportunities, i.e. 401K, IRA's and other options. As I near 
retirement I don't need additional taxes to impede my ability to retire while I still have life in me. 
I hope you agree and vote against HB476 in committee. Let's find ways to make it cheaper to 
live in Hawaii, not more expensive.

We retired early here after decades of hard work. If you wanna start taxing us like our last state 
did, we can easily move our $11 million to another state that doesn't have income taxes. We're 
the ones paying through the nose to support all the programs keeping people here. Which we 
don't mind too much. However, if it becomes more of a burden, we're gonna have to look at other 
options for where we want to reside. We don't have children in the school system nor do we take 
any government help. We only support systems we will never tap into. Going up to 20% on hotel 
taxes will ruin our economy also.  
Local residents are already facing enough financial pressure. That is why I hope you will vote 
against HB476 this year. Instead of raising taxes, I encourage you to explore other ways to help 
reduce costs for families. Mahalo for considering my testimony.

I have been an owner of a condo here since 1999. I have watched our politicians , council 
members and others continue to add on more and more costs for all residents.  
Their is an exodus of owners and renters to other states. Add to that tourism will continue to go 
down in numbers too.  
Apparently that is what you people want. I do not. 
In many areas employees of the city and state are overpaid, in my opinion. 
Thank you for reading my message.

There is no need to increase the tax rate. Hawaii already has a tax surplus and the additional tax 
is just an incentive to move to a new jurisdiction. As a SaSS business owner based in Hawaii, it's 
easy to teleport our software company to any tax-friendly location such as Dubai, Mauritius, 
Virgin Islands, etc. We need more innovation in the state and higher taxes discourage this.

As you are aware, over the past six years, Hawaii's population has been steadily declining, with 
tens of thousands of residents leaving the state.  
Hawaii residents face one of the highest tax burdens in the nation, and already face enough 
financial pressure.  
Hawaii needs policies that foster economic growth, not policies that push people away. 
That is why I hope you will vote against HB476 this year.  
Instead of raising taxes, I encourage you to explore other ways to help reduce costs for families.  
Mahalo for considering my testimony.

I am submitting testimony in strong opposition to any tax increases, especially on capital gains 
tax rates. You just passed major tax relief last year. Why raise taxes this year? Given the current 
budget surplus, I don't think there is any need to raise taxes on residents who are already 
struggling with the high cost of living. Please focus on finding ways to lower costs instead.

I would like to testify in opposition to HB476.  
As seniors in retirement we rely on capital gains, which have already been taxed as income 
before we invested the money, to supplement our other sources of funds. A tax increase would be 
punitive and affect the very people who are contributing the most to Hawaii's economy through 
income taxes, property taxes, sales taxes, charitable contributions, etc. 
Please vote against this bill.

Aloha Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki and members of the Committee on Ways & 
Means, 
My name is Will Caron and I am a resident of Kahaluʻu. I am testifying in strong support of 
HB476, which would increase the tax rate on capital gains to help fund our future. In its original 
form, HB476 proposed raising the maximum capital gains tax to 9 percent and the alternative 
capital gains tax for corporations to 5 percent. This change would help address the unfair tax 
advantages currently enjoyed by wealthy individuals. 
Capital gains are profits earned from selling assets like stocks, bonds, art, and antiques. 
Hawaiʻi’s current maximum capital gains tax rate is just 7.25 percent—much lower than the top 
11 percent tax rate on income from regular jobs. 
This creates a loophole that favors the high-income individuals who have the resources needed to 
begin with to buy and sell capital assets. 
These high income earners make up a large portion of their income from capital gains, which 
means they can end up paying a far lower overall tax rate than is appropriate for their income 
level. In some cases, they could end up paying a lower effective tax rate than low- and middle-
income workers who earn their income through wages. 
The wealthiest taxpayers in Hawaiʻi earn 80 percent of all long-term capital gains in the 
state. Increasing the capital gains tax would ensure these wealthy individuals contribute more to 
support schools, infrastructure, affordable housing, and government assistance programs, all of 
which are essential to a healthy, functioning society that we can all enjoy and thrive within.  
The best policy would be to simply tax capital gains at the same progressive, marginal rates as 
the state taxes regular income from wages. This would completely close the loophole and would 
be the most fair way to go.  
Mahalo for the opportunity to testify!

Strong opposition. 
Firstly, it's a fallacy to think that this will produce the anticipated amount of revenue. 
The referred-to tax payers making over $400K per year have excellent advisement services. They 
will be advised to move to non-affected investments OR move money to locations not subjected 
to this bill. These outcomes are probably already happening leading to an over-all financial loss 
for Hawaii. 
I heard that when California raised taxes on the wealthy around 20 to 25 years ago, two million 
wealthy families per day moved out of state. This is an example of how empowered the wealthy 
are to avoid taxes. 
I don't have the $1M investment capital required by savvy investment services, so I taught 
myself investing. I'm in the other 25% that the proponents of this bill say make less than $400K 
per year. We are the ones who will be paying the extra tax in amounts far less than the surmised 
total because we don't have the knowledge to avoid it. 
In addition, as an economic in-betweener, I don't quality for any of the phenomenal government 
programs available to low-income earners like SNAP benefits, etc. At the same time, I can't 
afford to own a home and as such don't benefit from the 'welfare for the wealthy' home-owner 
tax deductions. 
As a result, a lower tax on some investments and the yearly standard deduction are the ONLY 
tax breaks and beneficial government programs that I enjoy.  And now I may lose one of these. 
Lastly, this bill is too all-encompassing. Individual and corporate taxation in the same bill is too 
much. 
In summary: 
• 
The wealthy won't pay the extra tax due to savvy advisement. They'll move their 
investments to unaffected instruments or move their money to other geographic locations. 
This is probably already happening in anticipation. Hawaii will lose over time as a result. 

• 
The anticipated amount won't materialize because it will be paid only by the relatively 
few economic in-betweeners.  At the same time, we also don't qualify for most 
government programs and tax breaks. 
• 
The bill is too all-compassing regarding entities taxed. 
Please vote against this bill.  Thank you for reading my submission.

I strongly oppose HB476. Hawaii already has one of the highest costs of living, and increasing 
the rate on capital gains just makes things worse.  I just completed my income tax returns and 
will file them in a couple of days.  My tax bill for the state of Hawaii for 2024 is 
$79,326.00.  This seems quite a bit since I don't receive much in return.  And you want to make 
it even higher?  Texas and Florida (among a few others) have no state income taxes and I am 
definitely planning a trip.

I am writing to express my strong concerns about House Bill 476, specifically its proposal to 
increase the capital gains tax in Hawaii. As you know, the cost of living in our state is already 
among the highest in the nation, placing a significant burden on local families and businesses. 
Raising the capital gains tax would only exacerbate these challenges, potentially discouraging 
investment and reducing economic opportunities at a time when many of our communities are 
already struggling with expenses. This bill could adversely affect everyday citizens, small 
business owners, and retirees alike...those who depend on investments to make ends meet or 
grow their enterprises. 
I want to emphasize that I am part of a hui of engaged residents who are influential in our 
community and are closely monitoring legislative actions. We will be keeping track of those who 
support or oppose this legislation and will remember these stances come election season. 
For these reasons, I respectfully urge you to vote against HB476 in committee. Thank you for 
considering my perspective and for your continued service to the people of Hawaii. Please feel 
free to reach out if you have any questions or need further information.

I am firmly in opposition to HB476 HD2. We pay taxes on what we earn, and we pay taxes on 
EVERYTHING we buy and OWN! We shouldnʻt be paying taxes on the things we own. That is 
the beauty of working hard and owning what we worked so hard for.  
You are antagonizing people to commit more crimes by imposing unnecessary tax raises so you 
can get your pay raise.
