RE:
H.B. No. 476
H.D.
1
Honorable Nadine K. Nakamura
Speaker, House of Representatives
Thirty-Third State Legislature
Regular Session of 2025
State of Hawaii
Madame:
Your Committee on Economic
Development & Technology, to which was referred H.B. No. 476 entitled:
"A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO CAPITAL GAINS
TAX,"
begs leave to report as follows:
The
purpose of this measure is to
increase the capital gains tax rate for
individuals, estates, and trusts to nine percent and the alternative capital
gains tax rate for corporations to five percent.
Your Committee received testimony in support of this measure
from IATSE Local 665; Hawaii Appleseed Center for Law & Economic Justice;
Hawaii State AFL-CIO; Education Caucus of the Democratic Party of Hawai
ʻ
i;
and one individual.
Your Committee
received testimony in opposition to this measure from the Grassroot Institute
of Hawaii; Hawai
ʻ
i Association of
REALTORS; and six individuals.
Your
Committee received comments on this measure from the Department of Taxation and
Tax Foundation of Hawaii.
Your Committee
finds that eighty percent of all long-term capital gains in the State are earned
by the wealthiest group of taxpayers, who have incomes greater than $400,000,
exacerbating the State's income inequality.
This measure addresses this issue by increasing the capital gains tax rate
to nine percent and the alternative capital gains tax for corporations to five
percent.
Your Committee has
amended this measure by changing the effective date to July 1, 3000, to
encourage further discussion.
Your Committee notes,
as a reference for potential fiscal impact of this measure, estimates made in
2021 of revenue that would be generated by the same capital gains tax rate
increases proposed by this measure are as follows:
(1)
$53,700,000 for fiscal year 2025;
(2)
$55,500,000 for fiscal year 2026; and
(3)
$57,000,000 for fiscal year 2027.
As affirmed by the
record of votes of the members of your Committee on Economic Development &
Technology that is attached to this report, your Committee is in accord with
the intent and purpose of H.B. No. 476, as amended herein, and recommends that
it pass Second Reading in the form attached hereto as H.B. No. 476, H.D. 1, and
be referred to your Committee on Finance.
Respectfully
submitted on behalf of the members of the Committee on Economic Development
& Technology,
