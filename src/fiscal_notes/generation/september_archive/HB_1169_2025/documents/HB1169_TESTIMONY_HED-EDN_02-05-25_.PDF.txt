University of Hawai‘i System 
HB 1169 – RELATING TO UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII CONFERENCE CENTER 
REVOLVING FUND 
Chair Garrett, Vice Chair Amato, and Members of the Committee: 
Thank you for the opportunity to present testimony today.  The University of Hawai‘i 
(UH) supports HB 1169, Relating to University of Hawaii Conference Center Revolving 
Fund.  This bill establishes the University of Hawai‘i Conference Center Revolving Fund 
and accounts under the fund to facilitate the administration of the fund for conference 
center programs among various campuses and operating units of the UH system. 
 
Conference Center Revolving Funds already exist for the Community Colleges and 
UH-Hilo.  This bill would create one UH Conference Center Revolving Fund and each 
campus would have accounts within this overarching fund, which would allow all 
campuses to standardize conference center programs across all campuses while 
eliminating unnecessary duplication of statutes.  This structure is similar to many other 
UH funds, including the Tuition and Fees Special Fund, the Auxiliary Enterprises 
Special Fund, and the Student Activities Revolving Fund. 
 
Thank you for this opportunity to testify.
