RE:
H.B. No. 1169
H.D. 1
S.D. 1
Honorable Ronald D. Kouchi
President of the Senate
Thirty-Third State Legislature
Regular Session of 2025
State of Hawaii
Sir:
Your Committee on
Higher Education, to which was referred H.B. No. 1169, H.D. 1,
entitled:
"A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII
CONFERENCE CENTER REVOLVING FUND,"
begs leave to report as follows:
The
purpose and intent of this measure is to:
(1)
Establish the University of Hawaii Conference
Center Revolving Fund to facilitate the administration of the revolving fund
for conference center programs among various campuses and operating units of
the University of Hawaii System;
(2)
Repeal the Conference Center Revolving Fund
and the University of Hawaii at Hilo and the Community College Conference
Center Revolving Fund;
(3)
Lapse all appropriations and encumbrances of
the Conference Center Revolving Fund and the University of Hawaii at Hilo and
the Community College Conference Center Revolving Fund to the University of
Hawaii Conference Center Revolving Fund; and
(4)
Appropriate funds out of the University of
Hawaii Conference Center Revolving Fund.
Your Committee
received testimony in support of this measure from the University of Hawai
ʻ
i System.
Your Committee
finds that creating a single University of Hawaii Conference Center Revolving
Fund, with each campus having an account in the overarching fund, would allow
all campuses to standardize conference center programs across all campuses
while eliminating redundant provisions.
Your Committee further finds that structuring the University of Hawaii
Conference Center Revolving Fund in this manner would make it consistent with
other existing University of Hawaii funds, including the Tuition and Fees Special
Fund.
Your
Committee has amended this measure by:
(1)
Making it effective upon its approval; and
(2)
Making technical, nonsubstantive amendments
for the purposes of clarity and consistency.
As affirmed by the
record of votes of the members of your Committee on Higher Education that is
attached to this report, your Committee is in accord with the intent and
purpose of H.B. No. 1169, H.D. 1, as amended herein, and recommends
that it pass Second Reading in the form attached hereto as H.B. No. 1169,
H.D. 1, S.D. 1, and be referred to your Committee on Ways and Means.
Respectfully submitted on behalf
of the members of the Committee on Higher Education,
