  "overview": "This measure establishes the University of Hawaii conference center revolving fund to standardize and streamline financial administration for conference activities across all campuses. It repeals two existing conference center funds and consolidates their functions into this single new fund. The intent is to facilitate more efficient management of conference center moneys within the University of Hawaii System.",
  "appropriations": "This bill does not make a specific appropriation. It authorizes the establishment of a revolving fund that will be funded by transferring the existing balances from two conference center funds that are being repealed. Ongoing operational costs will be covered by the revenues generated by the university's conference center activities.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal analysis assumes that this is an administrative measure with no net fiscal impact on state funds. It is based on the assumption that all revenues and expenditures from the two repealed funds will be transferred to the new, consolidated fund. The methodology involves analyzing the legislative text to determine the structural change rather than calculating new costs, as no new programs are being created.",
  "agency_impact": "The University of Hawaii System is the agency impacted by this measure. The bill is expected to have a positive administrative impact by simplifying the management and oversight of conference center funds. This consolidation will standardize financial procedures and facilitate easier administration of moneys across all campuses.",
  "economic_impact": "This measure is not expected to have a direct economic impact, as it does not create new programs, services, or economic activity. The primary benefit is improved administrative efficiency for the University of Hawaii. No significant cost savings or new revenues for the state are anticipated as a direct result of this fund consolidation.",
  "policy_impact": "This measure amends existing law by repealing the statutes governing two separate conference center funds and establishing a single, unified revolving fund. This reflects a policy shift towards centralized financial management for specific self-sustaining activities within the University of Hawaii system. It aims to create greater consistency and clarity in the administration of conference center programs.",
  "revenue_sources": "The revenue source for the new University of Hawaii conference center revolving fund will be the income generated from conference center activities across all university campuses. These revenues, previously deposited into two separate funds, will now be directed into this single fund. No new taxes, fees, or general fund appropriations are established by this measure.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "Over a six-year period, this measure is expected to have no net fiscal impact on state general funds. The bill facilitates the transfer of existing fund balances from two repealed conference center funds into one new revolving fund. All revenues and expenditures related to the University of Hawaii's conference centers will be managed through this new fund. The purpose is administrative simplification, not the creation of a new program or service. Therefore, revenue and expenditure levels are expected to remain consistent with historical trends for conference center operations. No new positions are authorized or required by this measure. The ongoing operations will be supported by the revenues generated by the conference centers, making the fund self-sustaining. The primary fiscal implication is the administrative benefit of managing one fund instead of two, which may result in minor, unquantifiable efficiencies.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "This measure is not anticipated to have any impact on the total amount of operating revenue collected by the University of Hawaii. It solely changes the depository fund for existing revenues generated by conference center activities. Therefore, the net effect on operating revenues is neutral.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "There are no capital expenditures associated with this measure. The bill focuses exclusively on the administrative and financial restructuring of conference center funds. It does not authorize or fund any new construction, renovations, or major equipment purchases.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "Beyond the six-year fiscal period, the fiscal implications are expected to remain neutral. The University of Hawaii conference center revolving fund will continue to operate as a self-sustaining entity, with its expenditures supported by its own revenues. No future general fund support is anticipated or required for these activities.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "A previous fiscal note was not provided. This analysis is based entirely on the text of H.B. No. 1169, H.D. 1, S.D. 2."
