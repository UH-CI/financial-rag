  "overview": "This version of the measure, HB 1169 HD1, has been amended to change the effective date to July 1, 3000. This amendment, intended to encourage further discussion, means the proposed consolidation of the University of Hawaii's conference center revolving funds will not take effect. Therefore, the bill in its current form will have no fiscal or operational impact.",
  "appropriations": "As the measure will not be implemented due to its effective date, the transfer of appropriations, encumbrances, and unencumbered funds from the existing conference center revolving funds will not occur. The existing funds will continue to operate as they currently do. No new appropriations are made.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The primary assumption has been updated to reflect that the bill will not be enacted in the foreseeable future due to the defective effective date of July 1, 3000. Consequently, the fiscal analysis concludes there is no impact, as the status quo will be maintained. This supersedes previous assumptions about the administrative transfer of funds.",
  "agency_impact": "There is no longer an anticipated impact on the University of Hawai‘i System. The administrative efficiencies expected from consolidating the revolving funds will not be realized under this version of the bill. The agency will continue to manage the separate conference center revolving funds for the Community Colleges and UH-Hilo.",
  "economic_impact": "This measure will have no economic impact. The previous fiscal note indicated no direct economic impact, and this remains the case, as the bill will not be implemented. Administrative operations will continue under the current structure.",
  "policy_impact": "This measure will no longer have a policy impact, as its effective date prevents implementation. The existing statutes governing the Conference Center Revolving Fund for the University of Hawaii at Hilo and the Community College Conference Center Revolving Fund will not be repealed. The policy of maintaining separate funds will continue.",
  "revenue_sources": "Revenues from conference center activities will continue to be deposited into the two existing, separate revolving funds. The proposed single University of Hawaii Conference Center Revolving Fund will not be established. Therefore, there is no change to the current revenue deposit structure.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "This measure has no fiscal implications for the next six years or any foreseeable fiscal period. The amended effective date of July 1, 3000, means the proposed consolidation of funds and repeal of existing statutes will not occur. All revenues and expenditures will continue to be managed through the existing separate revolving funds for the Community Colleges and UH-Hilo, maintaining the fiscal status quo. No transfer of funds will take place, and no administrative changes will be implemented. Therefore, the fiscal impact is zero.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "There will be no impact on operating revenues. Revenues will continue to be collected and deposited into the existing separate revolving funds as they are under current law. The proposed consolidation will not occur.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "There are no fiscal implications after six years because the bill, as amended with an effective date of July 1, 3000, will not be implemented. The current financial structure for the university's conference centers will remain in place indefinitely. The status quo will be maintained.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The most significant update from the previous fiscal note is the amendment to HB 1169 HD1 that changes the bill's effective date to July 1, 3000. This 'defective date' effectively prevents the measure from being implemented. Consequently, all previously anticipated impacts—including the consolidation of funds, administrative efficiencies, and transfer of balances—are now moot, and the bill has no fiscal or operational impact in its current form."
