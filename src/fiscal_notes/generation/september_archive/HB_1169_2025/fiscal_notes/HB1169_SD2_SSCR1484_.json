  "overview": "This measure establishes a single, system-wide University of Hawaii Conference Center Revolving Fund to standardize and streamline the administration of conference center programs across all campuses. The bill consolidates existing funds by repealing the separate conference center revolving funds for the University of Hawai‘i at Hilo and the community colleges. The intent is to eliminate statutory duplication and create a more efficient financial structure modeled after other successful University of Hawai‘i system-wide funds.",
  "appropriations": "This measure does not appropriate any new funds. It authorizes the transfer of all unexpended and unencumbered balances from the two repealed conference center revolving funds into the new, consolidated fund. These transferred moneys will be used to cover all costs related to operating conference center programs, including staffing and services.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal analysis assumes this bill is primarily administrative and will not have a net fiscal impact on the state's general fund. The methodology is based on the consolidation of existing revolving fund balances, rather than the creation of a new, funded program. This approach is modeled on other successful University of Hawai‘i system-wide funds, such as the Tuition and Fees Special Fund.",
  "agency_impact": "The University of Hawai‘i system will experience a positive administrative impact through streamlined financial management of its conference center programs. By consolidating multiple funds into one, the university can standardize procedures and reduce duplicative administrative efforts. This measure is expected to improve operational efficiency without requiring additional staff or resources.",
  "economic_impact": "This bill is not expected to have a direct or significant economic impact, as it reorganizes the administration of existing funds. However, the resulting operational efficiencies could enhance the University of Hawai‘i's ability to attract and manage conferences and events. This may lead to an indirect positive impact on the local economy through increased visitor-related spending.",
  "policy_impact": "This measure modifies state law by repealing the separate statutes for the conference center revolving funds at the University of Hawai‘i at Hilo and the community colleges. It establishes a new, unified statute for a system-wide fund, aligning its structure with other major University of Hawai‘i special and revolving funds. This change reflects a policy shift towards more centralized and standardized financial management within the university system.",
  "revenue_sources": "The primary revenue source for the new revolving fund will be moneys generated from the operation of conference center programs across the University of Hawai‘i system. Upon its establishment, the fund will be capitalized by the transfer of all existing balances from the two revolving funds being repealed. All future revenues from conference activities will be deposited into this single fund.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "This measure is expected to have a neutral fiscal impact on the State's general fund over the next six years. The University of Hawaii Conference Center Revolving Fund is designed to be self-sustaining, with all expenditures covered by revenues generated from program activities. The bill consolidates existing funds and does not introduce new costs to the state. The primary effect will be improved administrative efficiency within the University of Hawai‘i system, which could lead to indeterminate cost savings. All revenues from conference programs will be deposited into the fund, and expenditures for personnel, services, and equipment will be made from it. This ensures the continued operation of the programs without requiring general fund appropriations. The fiscal impact remains neutral as expenditures are limited to the revenues collected.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "This measure will not generate new operating revenue for the University of Hawai‘i or the State. It consolidates existing revenue streams from the separate UH-Hilo and Community College conference center funds into a single, system-wide revolving fund. The total revenue generated by all conference center activities is not expected to change as a direct result of this administrative reorganization.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "No capital expenditures are anticipated as a result of this measure. The bill focuses on the administrative and financial restructuring of existing conference center programs. It does not authorize or fund any new construction, facilities, or major equipment purchases.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The fiscal implications after six years are expected to remain neutral to the state's general fund. The University of Hawaii Conference Center Revolving Fund will continue to operate on a self-sustaining basis, with its expenditures funded entirely by program revenues. The long-term impact will be the sustained administrative efficiency and financial stability of the university's conference center programs.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The previous fiscal note was based on H.B. 1169, H.D. 1, S.D. 1, which addressed the bill's effective date. This fiscal note is for H.B. 1169, H.D. 1, S.D. 2, which introduces a key substantive change by clarifying the permissible uses of moneys from the newly established University of Hawaii Conference Center Revolving Fund. This version also includes minor technical amendments for clarity and consistency."
