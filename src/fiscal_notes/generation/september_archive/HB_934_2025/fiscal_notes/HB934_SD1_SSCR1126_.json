  "overview": "The proposed measure has been updated to formally rename the Hawaii Broadband and Digital Equity Office to the \"Broadband Office\" and establishes a \"Broadband Revolving Fund\" rather than a special fund. It also statutorily consolidates state broadband efforts by repealing the duties of the Director of Commerce and Consumer Affairs and dissolving the Broadband Assistance Advisory Council. These changes centralize broadband responsibilities within the Office of Enterprise Technology Services.",
  "appropriations": "A new, specific one-time appropriation of $200,000 from general funds is included for fiscal year 2025-2026 to capitalize the new Broadband Revolving Fund for the purpose of reimbursing contracts. Testimony indicates this is intended as a temporary loan to be repaid to the General Fund within five years. Additionally, a blank appropriation has been inserted to establish an unspecified number of new full-time equivalent \"digital navigator\" positions to be funded from the revolving fund.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal analysis now incorporates the assumption that the $200,000 general fund appropriation is a temporary cash-flow mechanism, not a permanent increase in operational funding. This amount is modeled as a short-term loan to the revolving fund, designed to bridge timing gaps in drawing down federal funds. The methodology anticipates this sum will be returned to the General Fund within a five-year period.",
  "agency_impact": "The measure's impact is now expanded to include the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs (DCCA), as the bill officially repeals its broadband-related statutory duties. Testimony from DCCA indicates that this consolidation will eliminate duplicative functions and will not negatively impact public services. The formal dissolution of the Broadband Assistance Advisory Council further centralizes oversight and advisory functions within the new Broadband Office.",
  "economic_impact": "",
  "policy_impact": "The policy framework has shifted with the creation of a \"Broadband Revolving Fund,\" which allows for greater financial autonomy and long-term sustainability by enabling funds to be carried over and reused, unlike a standard special fund. The formal repeal of DCCA's broadband authority and the disbanding of the Broadband Assistance Advisory Council represent a significant consolidation of state broadband governance. This centralizes policy development and implementation within a single office under the State Chief Information Officer.",
  "revenue_sources": "A new, specific revenue source has been added for fiscal year 2025-2026: a one-time infusion of $200,000 from the state's general revenues. This appropriation is intended to provide initial seed money for the newly created Broadband Revolving Fund. The fund is also statutorily authorized to receive proceeds from state-owned infrastructure leases, legislative appropriations, gifts, and grants.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The six-year outlook now includes a one-time $200,000 general fund appropriation in fiscal year 2026, coupled with the intent to repay this amount over the subsequent five years, creating a short-term liability for the new revolving fund. The establishment of the fund as a revolving account, rather than a special fund, provides a mechanism for long-term self-sufficiency based on future lease revenues. A new, currently unquantified recurring cost has been introduced for \"digital navigator\" positions, which will require funding in future fiscal years to be implemented.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The fiscal plan now includes the resolution of the $200,000 general fund advance, as it is intended to be repaid within the initial five-year period. The establishment of the revolving fund is designed to provide a sustainable financial structure for the Broadband Office beyond the initial six-year period, relying on recurring revenues from infrastructure leases to fund ongoing operations. This reduces the long-term dependency on direct general fund appropriations for operational costs.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The measure has been substantially amended to rename the office to the \"Broadband Office\" and redesignate its fund as the \"Broadband Revolving Fund.\" A new, specific $200,000 one-time repayable general fund appropriation for fiscal year 2026 has been added to facilitate timely contract reimbursements. The bill now explicitly repeals the broadband duties of the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs and dissolves the Broadband Assistance Advisory Council, formally consolidating state broadband authority."
