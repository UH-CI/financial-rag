  "overview": "This measure transfers the Hawaii Broadband and Digital Equity Office (HBDEO) to the Office of Enterprise Technology Services and establishes the Broadband and Digital Equity Special Fund. A key amendment in H.B. 934 H.D. 1 restricts the use of the special fund, explicitly excluding expenditures on the deployment of broadband infrastructure for providing retail service. The bill's appropriation amounts have been left unspecified for further deliberation.",
  "appropriations": "The specific appropriation of $200,000 from the general fund into the new special fund for FY 2026 has been removed, and the amounts are now unspecified in H.B. 934 H.D. 1. The House Committee on Economic Development & Technology has requested that the Committee on Finance consider an appropriation of $200,000. The operational budget request of $777,090, while still identified as necessary by the receiving agency, is not included in the amended bill.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "While the cost basis for agency operational needs remains the HBDEO's prior budget request for $777,090, the methodology has shifted as the bill's appropriations are now blank. Financial projections are currently suspended pending further legislative discussion and decisions by the Committee on Finance. The assumption is that funding levels will be determined later in the legislative process.",
  "agency_impact": "The transfer of the HBDEO to the Office of Enterprise Technology Services remains, but the fiscal impact on ETS is now more uncertain due to the unspecified appropriations. ETS continues to assert that without adequate funding, estimated at $777,090 for FY 2026, the transfer would negatively impact its existing critical services. The lack of a defined budget in the current version of the bill heightens these concerns.",
  "economic_impact": "The economic impact of the special fund has been narrowed by the exclusion of funding for retail service infrastructure. This amendment may limit the state's ability to fund community-led broadband networks or other initiatives aimed at increasing competition in the retail internet service market. The fund will instead prioritize projects related to broadband adoption, digital literacy, and affordability programs.",
  "policy_impact": "A significant policy change has been introduced by amending the bill to prohibit the special fund from being used for the deployment of retail broadband infrastructure. This change, prompted by industry testimony, curtails the state's ability to directly fund new infrastructure intended for retail competition. This shifts the policy focus of the fund away from infrastructure development and more towards digital equity and adoption programs.",
  "revenue_sources": "While the intended revenue sources for the special fund, such as lease agreements and federal funds, remain the same, the initial seed funding from the General Fund is no longer specified in the bill. The appropriation of $200,000 is now a recommendation for consideration rather than a legislated amount. This makes the fund's initial capitalization dependent on future legislative action.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The six-year fiscal outlook is now uncertain, as H.B. 934 H.D. 1 contains unspecified appropriation amounts. Previously, a budget of $777,090 for FY 2026 was projected based on agency requests, with a one-time $200,000 general fund infusion for a revolving fund. With these amounts removed, long-term financial planning for the office is contingent on funding decisions to be made by the Committee on Finance. The successful management of federal grants and the office's ability to conduct community outreach depend entirely on the final appropriation amounts. Without the specified funding, the fiscal implications cannot be accurately projected over the six-year period, and the goal of repaying the initial seed money within five years is now a hypothetical scenario. The lack of a defined budget creates significant uncertainty regarding staffing and operational capacity for the foreseeable future.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The potential use of the special fund for capital expenditures has been significantly restricted. The fund is now explicitly prohibited from supporting capital projects related to the deployment of broadband infrastructure for retail service. This narrows the scope of state-supported capital investments to non-retail projects, such as those for community anchor institutions.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The long-term fiscal sustainability of the Broadband Office is now less certain due to the unspecified initial appropriations. While the special fund is still intended to become self-sustaining through revenues from infrastructure leases, its ability to support programs is dependent on the level of initial investment determined by future legislation. The office's ongoing operating costs will require consistent funding, the source and amount of which are now undefined.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "Key changes in H.B. 934 H.D. 1 include: the specific appropriation amounts for FY 2026 have been changed to be unspecified; the uses of the newly established Broadband and Digital Equity Special Fund have been restricted to exclude the deployment of broadband infrastructure for retail service; and the bill's effective date has been changed to July 1, 3000, to encourage further discussion. Additionally, testimony has proposed renaming the office to the 'Broadband Office' and the special fund to the 'Broadband Revolving Fund'."
