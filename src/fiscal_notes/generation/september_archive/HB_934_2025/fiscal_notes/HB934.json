  "overview": "This bill transfers the Hawaii Broadband and Digital Equity Office (HBDEO) from the Department of Business, Economic Development, and Tourism (DBEDT) to the Office of Enterprise Technology Services (ETS) within the Department of Accounting and General Services. It also establishes a special fund, proposed to be a revolving fund, to manage revenues from broadband infrastructure and appropriates funds for the office's operations. The measure aims to centralize and streamline the state's broadband and digital equity functions.",
  "appropriations": "The bill proposes a one-time general fund appropriation of $200,000 into a newly created broadband revolving fund to facilitate timely reimbursements for contracts while awaiting federal funds. Additionally, the Office of Enterprise Technology Services supports including HBDEO's requested budget of $777,090 for FY 2026, comprising $452,302 for personal services and $324,788 for other expenses. A federal fund appropriation for digital navigator positions is also proposed, though the amount is not specified.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The financial projections are based on a Form A budget request previously submitted by the HBDEO, which identified a need for $777,090 in FY 2026 to adequately fund four staff positions and cover essential operating expenses. This budget is considered the minimum required by ETS to successfully absorb the HBDEO's functions without negatively impacting its existing services. The methodology assumes that the current budget of $360,000 is insufficient for the office to meet its statutory objectives, especially concerning community outreach.",
  "agency_impact": "This measure will transfer all responsibilities of the HBDEO from DBEDT to ETS, which anticipates this as a 'huge endeavor' requiring significant new resources. ETS states that without the requested appropriation of $777,090, the transfer would negatively impact its critical internal services and fail to improve HBDEO's functioning. The Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs supports this consolidation, as it would transfer its overlapping broadband-related duties to the HBDEO, reducing public confusion and increasing efficiency.",
  "economic_impact": "The measure is expected to enhance economic and educational opportunities for residents by facilitating the deployment of reliable and affordable high-speed internet across the state. The establishment of a revolving fund, capitalized by revenues from leasing new broadband infrastructure, aims to reduce internet costs and support community broadband projects. This initiative leverages over $400 million in committed federal and state funds to modernize Hawaii's digital infrastructure.",
  "policy_impact": "This bill centralizes the state's broadband policy and implementation by moving the HBDEO to ETS, the state's central IT agency. It proposes repealing the broadband duties assigned to the Director of the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs and disbanding the Hawaii Broadband Assistance Advisory Council to consolidate functions. This restructuring establishes a single point of accountability for managing federal funds and state broadband assets, streamlining governance.",
  "revenue_sources": "The primary new funding source is a proposed one-time $200,000 appropriation from the General Fund into a new Broadband Revolving Fund for FY 2026, intended to be repaid within five years. The revolving fund is designed to become self-sustaining by collecting revenues from negotiated lease agreements on state-supported subsea and terrestrial broadband infrastructure. The measure also proposes an appropriation from federal funds to support digital navigator positions.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The six-year fiscal outlook includes a significant increase in the operating budget for the newly transferred Broadband Office. The Office of Enterprise Technology Services supports an annual budget of $777,090 starting in FY 2026, a substantial increase from the current $360,000, to cover personnel and operational costs. This funding is deemed critical for the office to manage over $400 million in federal and state broadband investments and conduct necessary community outreach. A one-time general fund appropriation of $200,000 is requested for FY 2026 to seed the new Broadband Revolving Fund, with the intent to repay this amount to the General Fund within five years. The revolving fund is projected to begin generating its own revenue from leases on new infrastructure assets during this period. These revenues are intended to support ongoing digital equity programs and reduce reliance on general funds in the future. Failure to provide the requested operational funding would jeopardize the success of the transfer and the management of federal grants. Staffing is expected to be maintained at four positions, with costs for personal services accounting for $452,302 of the requested annual budget. Recurring expenses for operations are projected at $324,788 annually. These costs are necessary to ensure the office can fulfill its expanded responsibilities effectively.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The bill is anticipated to have a positive impact on operating revenues by establishing the Broadband Revolving Fund. This fund will collect revenues from lease agreements on new state-invested broadband infrastructure. These funds are designated to support the state's digital equity goals, potentially creating a sustainable, non-general fund revenue stream for broadband initiatives.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "While this bill does not directly appropriate funds for new capital expenditures, its primary purpose is to improve the state's management of significant capital projects. The HBDEO is responsible for deploying over $400 million in federal and state funds for modernizing and building new subsea and terrestrial broadband infrastructure. The creation of the revolving fund will also support future broadband capital projects across the state.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "Beyond the initial six-year period, the Broadband Office will require sustained annual operating funds, estimated to be at least $777,090 (adjusted for inflation), to continue managing state broadband programs and assets. The Broadband Revolving Fund is expected to be fully operational and self-sustaining, generating sufficient revenue from infrastructure leases to cover its program costs. The long-term fiscal health will depend on the successful management and monetization of the new publicly-funded infrastructure.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "No previous fiscal note was provided in the source documents."
