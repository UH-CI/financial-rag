  "overview": "",
  "appropriations": "Testimony has identified a new, significant appropriation consideration not previously noted: Hawaii's share of federal Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) Program funding is $149.5 million, which requires a $46 million state match. The Office of Enterprise Technology Services (ETS) has also provided a specific breakdown for its FY 2026 operational funding request of $777,090, allocating $452,302 for personal services and $324,788 for other operating expenses. This is based on HBDEO's current budget of $360,000 being insufficient, leaving it with essentially no operating funds for the past two fiscal years.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal analysis methodology is now updated to include the state's need to secure a $46 million state match to leverage the $149.5 million federal allocation from the BEAD Program. This assumption establishes a clear nexus between a specific state appropriation and the receipt of a much larger federal grant. Cost projections for the office's operations are now based on the detailed $777,090 budget request provided by ETS.",
  "agency_impact": "ETS has raised a new concern that taking on the public-facing responsibilities of the HBDEO may dilute its primary statutory focus on the state's internal enterprise IT infrastructure. This represents a potential operational shift and diversion of management resources from its core mission. The inadequacy of the HBDEO's current $360,000 budget, which covers four staff members but leaves no funds for operations, is now formally documented.",
  "economic_impact": "The measure's economic context now includes an identified $149.5 million in federal BEAD Program funds available to the state, alongside significant private investment, such as Hawaiian Telcom's stated $1.7 billion infrastructure investment. Testimony has also specified positive impacts for targeted populations, noting that improved digital equity is critical for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities to access telehealth, education, and employment. These new data points provide a clearer picture of the scale of public and private efforts to expand broadband access.",
  "policy_impact": "New testimony has provided specific context for the policy change restricting the use of the special fund for retail infrastructure. Public testimony attributes the amendment to a request from Charter Communications, framing the policy implication as a choice between protecting incumbent providers and allowing for state investment in new, potentially competitive community-based broadband projects. This introduces an anti-competitive concern into the policy debate.",
  "revenue_sources": "A significant new revenue stream has been identified: $149.5 million from the federal Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) Program. However, this funding is contingent on the state providing a $46 million match. The state's anticipation of generating revenue from negotiated lease agreements on new subsea infrastructure has also been more explicitly stated.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The six-year fiscal outlook is now defined by a major new long-term financial obligation: the need to appropriate a $46 million state match to secure $149.5 million in federal BEAD Program funds for broadband infrastructure and digital literacy services. This replaces the previous fiscal uncertainty with a specific, high-value state investment requirement. The recurring annual operating cost for the Hawaii Broadband and Digital Equity Office has been more firmly established at the requested $777,090, providing a clearer baseline for future yearly expenses. The successful deployment of federal funds and the office's ability to provide technical assistance and community outreach are contingent on securing both the operational funding and the state match. The ability to generate revenue from infrastructure lease agreements is now a more concrete element of the long-term financial plan.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "It is now anticipated that the State will generate operating revenue through negotiated lease agreements resulting from the construction of new subsea broadband infrastructure. These funds are intended to be deposited into the new special fund. The establishment of this revenue stream is a new development in the fiscal analysis.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The primary capital expenditure implication for the state has been clarified: the state must plan for a $46 million capital outlay to serve as the required match for the $149.5 million in federal BEAD Program funds. This state investment is critical to unlocking the larger federal grant for broadband infrastructure projects. This shifts the focus from direct project funding out of the special fund to securing the necessary matching funds.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The long-term fiscal landscape now includes the ongoing management and maintenance of assets constructed with the $149.5 million in federal BEAD funds. The office's annual operating costs are more concretely projected to be approximately $777,090. The sustainability of the office and its programs will depend on both continued state support and the successful generation of revenue from infrastructure lease agreements.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The most significant new information is the identification of $149.5 million in federal BEAD Program funding available to Hawaii, which is contingent upon a $46 million state match. Testimony has now provided a detailed breakdown of the HBDEO's $777,090 operational budget request. Additionally, new testimony explicitly attributes the amendment restricting the special fund's use for retail service to a request from Charter Communications, raising anti-competitive concerns."
