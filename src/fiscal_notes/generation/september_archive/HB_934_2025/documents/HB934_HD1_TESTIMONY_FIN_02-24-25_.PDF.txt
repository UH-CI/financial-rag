Testimony on 
H.B. 934 - RELATING TO THE HAWAII BROADBAND AND  
DIGITAL EQUITY OFFICE 
 
Chair Yamashita, Vice Chair Takenouchi, and Members of the Committee: 
 
Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony in support of H.B. 934, H.D. 1 which 
transfers the Hawaii Broadband Office from the Department of Business, Economic 
Development, and Tourism (DBEDT) to the Office of Enterprise Technology Services 
(ETS) in the Department of Accounting and General Services, establishes the Hawaii 
Broadband and Digital Equity Special Fund, and appropriates additional funding. 
 
Reliable, affordable high speed internet access is essential for ensuring greater 
educational, economic, and social opportunities for all. The federal and state 
governments have committed over $400 million to modernize our subsea and terrestrial 
infrastructure and equip residents with the tools and knowledge to safely navigate the 
internet. With the construction of new subsea broadband infrastructure, our state 
anticipates generating revenue from negotiated lease agreements and the creation of a 
special fund will ensure these funds are used to reduce the cost of internet services, 
provide technical assistance to communities, and support broadband projects. 
 
Given the increasingly vital role of broadband in our daily lives, the transfer of the Hawaii 
Broadband Office from DBEDT to ETS provides an opportunity to consolidate and 
centralize broadband responsibilities currently dispersed across state government, 
including those of the Hawaii Broadband Assistance Advisory Council and other reporting 
requirements. Our office will work closely with the relevant departments to compile all 
broadband functions for the Legislature’s consideration. 
 
Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony in support of H.B. 934, H.D. 1.

TO THE HOUSE COMMITTEE ON FINANCE 
ON 
HOUSE BILL NO. 934, H.D. 1 
 
February 24, 2025

Room 308 and Videoconference 
 
 
RELATING TO THE HAWAII BROADBAND AND DIGITAL EQUITY OFFICE 
 
The Department of Budget and Finance (B&F) offers comments on this bill. 
 
House Bill (H.B.) No. 934, H.D. 1:  1)  transfers the Hawai‘i Broadband and 
Digital Equity Office (HBDEO) from the Department of Business, Economic 
Development and Tourism to the Office of Enterprise Technology Services in the 
Department of Accounting and General Services by repealing Chapter 206S, HRS, and 
adding a new part in Chapter 27, HRS; 2) establishes the Broadband and Digital Equity 
Special Fund (BDESF) to be administered by HBDEO for the purposes of supporting 
broadband projects, defraying the cost of internet services, and funding positions for 
personnel to provide technical assistance for the community; 3) appropriates an 
unspecified amount in general funds for FY 26 to be deposited into the BDESF; and 
4) appropriates an unspecified amount in special fund ceiling for the BDESF for FY 26.   
 
As a matter of general policy, B&F does not support the creation of any special 
fund, which does not meet the requirements of Section 37-52.3, HRS.  Special funds 
should:  1) serve a need as demonstrated by the purpose, scope of work, and an  
 
 

 
-2- 
 
 
 
explanation why the program cannot be implemented successfully under the general 
fund appropriation process; 2) reflect a clear nexus between the benefits sought and 
charges made upon the users or beneficiaries or a clear link between the program and 
the sources of revenue; 3) provide an appropriate means of financing for the program or 
activity; and 4) demonstrate the capacity to be financially self-sustaining.  Regarding 
H.B. No. 934, H.D. 1, it is difficult to determine whether the BDESF would be 
self-sustaining. 
 
Thank you for your consideration of our comments.

RELATING TO THE HAWAII BROADBAND AND DIGITAL EQUITY OFFICE.  
 
Chair Yamashita, Vice Chair Takenouchi and members of the Committee.  The 
Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism (DBEDT) provides the 
following comments on HB934 HD1 that transfers the Hawaii Broadband and Digital 
Equity Office (HBDEO) to the Office of Enterprise Technology Services in the 
Department of Accounting and General Services.   
HBDEO has provided steady leadership in state broadband and digital equity. I 
am confident that regardless of where the Office resides in state government, the Office 
will continue to provide the necessary leadership and accountability in carrying out its 
statutory responsibilities and in deployment and management of federal funds. DBEDT 
will continue to collaborate with the Office as it is an important piece to the future of 
digital workforce and economic development. 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify.

HOUSE BILL NO. 934 HD1 
RELATING TO THE HAWAIʻI BROADBAND AND DIGITAL EQUITY OFFICE 
  
Dear Chair Yamashita, Vice Chair Takenouchi, and members of the committee:  
  
The Office of Enterprise Technology Services (ETS) humbly offers comments on this bill that 
transfers the Hawaiʻi Broadband and Digital Equity Office (HBDEO) from the Department of 
Business, Economic Development, and Tourism to the Office of Enterprise Technology Services 
in the Department of Accounting and General Services, establishes the Hawaiʻi Broadband and 
Digital Equity Special Fund, and appropriates funds. 
 
ETS strongly supports Connect Kākou, led by Governor Josh Green and Lieutenant Governor 
Sylvia Luke, to ensure that every resident of Hawai’i has access to broadband Internet – plus the 
skills and devices they need to use the Internet.   
 
Taking over the responsibility of running and managing the Hawaiʻi Broadband and Digital Equity 
Office will be a huge endeavor for ETS. To be successful in this transfer we would ask to be funded 
appropriately from both state and federal sources. 
 
According to the HBDEO’s Form A request for Fiscal Year 25-27: “With the current budget of 
$360,000 to fund four staff and operating expenses, HBDEO has been operating with essentially 
no operating expenses for the past two fiscal years. Proper funding will enable the office to meet 
its objectives, especially in community outreach to rural, non-Oahu areas of the state.” 
 
The HBDEO had asked for $777,090 for FY 26 with $452,302 for personal services, and $324,788 
for other expenses.  
 
ETS believes that these figures provide for a sound budget, and we ask that this funding be included 
in the bill. We believe that, without proper funding for both salaries and operations, moving the

HBDEO to DAGS-ETS would not improve the functioning of the HBDEO but would in fact 
negatively impact critical services delivered through our existing program.  
Pursuant to Section 27-43, Hawaii Revised Statutes ETS provides governance and strategic 
planning for executive branch IT projects and we believe managing the infrastructure operations 
of broadband fall within the purview of this office. Our statutory responsibilities are focused on 
the State’s enterprise IT infrastructure which has supported departments directly. We have 
concerns that this shift may dilute this internal focus by diverting resources needed for this public 
outreach. 
Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony on this measure.

HB 934 HD1 – RELATING TO THE HAWAII BROADBAND AND DIGITAL EQUITY 
OFFICE 
Chair Yamashita, Vice Chair Takenouchi, and Members of the Committee: 
The University of Hawai‘i, representing the interests of the State in the implementation 
of federally funded broadband investments, supports HB 934 HD1 which transfers the 
Hawaiʻi Broadband and Digital Equity Office (HBDEO) from the Department of 
Business, Economic Development, and Tourism (DBEDT) to the Office of Enterprise 
Technology Services (ETS) in the Department of Accounting and General Services, and 
establishes the Hawaiʻi Broadband and Digital Equity Special Fund.  Transfer of the 
HBDEO under ETS, would place it within the management and oversight of the State 
Chief Information Officer, and will properly align the functions of the HBDEO together 
with other statewide technology infrastructure oversight, management and operations.  
The measure additionally provides for suitable governance under the statutorily 
established Information Technology Steering Committee. 
Establishment of the Hawaiʻi Broadband and Digital Equity Special Fund provides for 
the ability to collect and expend funds received as a beneficial outcome of the public 
investment in broadband infrastructure assets; and to ensure the funds are used to 
support long term sustainability of the state's broadband infrastructure assets and the 
ability of our community to benefit from those infrastructure assets.  Placing the 
ownership of the assets resulting from the federal broadband investments under the 
State Chief Information Officer, together with the Information Technology Steering 
Committee, will help to ensure the public's interest is protected and the benefits to 
Hawaiʻi maximized over the lifetime of these assets.  To help provide clarity over the 
intent of the use of the funds, we suggest the fund be titled the Hawaiʻi Broadband 
Special Fund. 
Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony in support of HB 934 HD1.

Dear Representative Yamashita, and Committee members 
 
SUBJECT: HB934 HD1 Relating to the Hawai’i Broadband and Digital Equity Office 
The Hawai῾i State Council on Developmental Disabilities SUPPORTS HB934 HD1, which 
transfers the Hawaiʻi Broadband and Digital Equity Office from the Department of Business, Economic 
Development, and Tourism to the Office of Enterprise Technology Services in the Department of 
Accounting and General Services. Establishes the Broadband and Digital Equity Special Fund. 
Appropriates funds. Effective 7/1/3000. (HD1) 
Access to broadband and digital technology is critical for individuals with intellectual and 
developmental disabilities (I/DD) to fully participate in society. Reliable internet connectivity and digital 
literacy are essential for accessing telehealth services, engaging in educational opportunities, securing 
employment, and participating in community life. HB934 HD1 strengthens the State's infrastructure to 
ensure digital equity, especially for underserved and vulnerable populations. 
The proposed restructuring and the establishment of the special fund will enhance the State’s 
ability to develop and implement strategies to improve broadband access and affordability. The 
emphasis on supporting broadband projects, and funding positions for technical assistance aligns with 
the needs of the I/DD community, which often faces significant barriers to digital inclusion. 
Thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony in support of HB934 HD1.  
Sincerely,

COMMENTS FOR:  
 H.B. 934, H.D. 1 – RELATING TO BROADBAND AND DIGITAL EQUITY OFFICE 
  
To: Chair Yamashita, Vice-Chair Takenouchi, and Members of the Committee  
Re: Testimony providing comments for HB 934, HD1 
 
Aloha Honorable Chair, Vice-Chair, and Committee Members:  
  
Thank you for this opportunity to provide comments on House Bill 934, HD1, to transfer  
the Hawai‘i  Broadband and Digital Equity Office (“HBDEO”) from the Department of  
Business, Economic Development, and Tourism (“DBEDT”) to the Office of Enterprise  
Technology Services (“ETS”) in the Department of Accounting and General Services (“DAGS”) 
establishes the Hawai‘i Broadband and Digital Equity Special Fund and appropriates additional funds. 
  
Hawaiian Telcom supports the intent of this bill, which consolidates broadband planning, coordination, 
and operations duties currently disbursed across multiple agencies under one umbrella to leverage 
resources and promote efficiency and efficacy.   
 
As the State and broadband service providers navigate the evolving landscape of broadband 
infrastructure and funding with the new federal administration, we must consider strategic approaches 
that maximize efficiency and align with federal initiatives. The Broadband Equity, Access, and 
Deployment (“BEAD”) Program, which allocates $42.45 billion to expand high-speed internet access, 
presents a unique opportunity for our state to enhance its broadband capabilities. The State share of 
BEAD funding is $149.5M plus $46M in state matching funds to increase broadband infrastructure and 
promote digital literacy services.  Additionally, as a broadband service provider, Hawaiian Telcom 
continues to invest hundreds of millions of dollars annually to expand broadband infrastructure across 
the State to deliver high-speed internet services to rural and urban areas.  Hawaiian Telcom’s historic 
$1.7B investment aims to meet the rapidly evolving technology needs of families and businesses across 
the state, ensuring Hawai‘i remains at the forefront of broadband innovation and provides a once-in-a-
generation opportunity to ensure that access to broadband services is available to all households. 
 
In closing, Hawaiian Telcom supports the intent of this bill and the appropriation of general funds to 
match federal funds for broadband programs and services funded through BEAD programs.  We 
appreciate the opportunity to offer comments for HB 934, HD1.

Aloha Committee Members: 
 
I write in support of HB934 HD1 and the funding level recommended by the Committee on 
Economic Development & Technology but with one amendment. 
 
At page Page 6, Line 9, please restore the original bill’s language, specifically to say:  
    (1) Supporting broadband projects; 
Because it involves the use of money, I respectfully suggest that the change is within your purview.  
 
The change in HD1, prohibiting the provision of retail service, was made at the request of Charter 
Communications.  Possible interpretations of Charter’s language could prevent even small, 
innovative projects in unserved or underserved communities.  It could even prevent cooperation 
with Charter! 
 
Please pass HB934 with the recommended restored language. 
 
Sincerely,

Supporting HB934 - "Relating to the Hawaii Broadband Digital Equity Office" 
 
Thank you for this opportunity to share testimony regarding HB934 HD1.  In sum, I support the 
intent of HB934 and hope you will amend the measure to address the State's need for 
consumer protection and public interest advocacy to achieve digital equity for the Islands. 
 
The need for thoughtful reform of State digital equity efforts is clear.  As Lt. Governor’s 
testimony at the first hearing on HB934 noted: “Our office will work closely with the relevant 
departments to compile all broadband functions for the Legislature’s consideration."  An 
inventory of State broadband functions will be helpful to inform public policy going forward. 
 
Unfortunately, on its way to the Finance Committee, HB934 was amended for anti-competitive 
purposes at the request of Charter, a regulated communications utility serving the Islands. 
Looking at the Committee review, Charter merely points out that "retail service" is being 
"separately supported by federal funding," as reason enough to restrict and hinder State 
investments to meet local needs.  In this case, undue deference was given to a special private 
interest at the expense of consumers and public interests.   
 
The language in HB934 HD1 that Charter proposed is undefined and potentially includes any 
service that is sold to a consumer.  It sounds like a duopolist's dream - use federal funding 
without local obligations to build essential networks, then restrict state funding to programmatic 
involvement to fund the network owners.  The anticompetitive benefit to incumbents, including 
the State's largest providers, is clear. 
 
Why prohibit digital equity projects from building community networks that provide "retail 
service?"  How are consumers protected by restricting State investments in digital equity?  
Ideally, the State will begin to thoughtfully consider local information needs that are not met by 
the commercial marketplace, including:  public health & safety; education; community based 
economic development; culture & arts; and, civic engagement.   
 
Thanks for your thoughtful consideration of this testimony and please feel free to contact me if 
you would like more information or perspective on this issue.
