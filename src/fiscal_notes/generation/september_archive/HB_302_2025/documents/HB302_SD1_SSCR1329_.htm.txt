Honolulu,

RE:
H.B. No. 302
H.D. 2
S.D. 1
Honorable Ronald D. Kouchi
President of the Senate
Thirty-Third State Legislature
Regular Session of 2025
State of Hawaii
Sir:
Your Committees on
Health and Human Services and Commerce and Consumer Protection, to which was
referred H.B. No. 302, H.D. 2, entitled:
"A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO CANNABIS,"
beg leave to report as follows:
The
purpose and intent of this measure is to repeal the requirement that a
provider-patient relationship be established in person.
Your
Committees received testimony in support of this measure from the Department of
Health, Hawai'i Cannabis Industry Association, ACLU of Hawai'i, Marijuana
Policy Project, Hawai
ʻ
i Alliance for
Cannabis Reform, Cure Oahu, Ohana Unity Party, Big Island Grown Dispensaries, Drug
Policy Forum of Hawaii, and three individuals.
Your Committees received comments on this
measure from Akamai Cannabis Consulting
.
Your Committees
find that access for qualifying patients and primary caregivers to medical
cannabis and particularly licensed medical cannabis dispensaries remains
challenging due to limited access to medical providers, delays in obtaining
allowed access to enter and purchase medical cannabis, and the availability of
cannabis through a thriving illicit market.
Your Committees further find that registration for the medical cannabis
program has decreased in the last few years, indicating that residents are shifting
away from licensed medical cannabis dispensaries, and instead are obtaining
their medical cannabis from elsewhere due to administrative barriers, delays in
registering, and the ease and lower costs of obtaining cannabis elsewhere.
Your Committees believe that this apparent
shift away from licensed medical cannabis dispensaries toward the illicit
market undermines the purposes of the medical cannabis program in ensuring
patient safety, product safety, and public safety.
This measure improves and increases access to
medical cannabis in the State by allowing a patient-provider relationship to be
established via telehealth for the purposes of certifying patients for the
medical use of cannabis.
Your Committees have
amended this measure by:
(1)
Inserting
language to amend the definition of "debilitating medical condition"
in section 329-121, Hawaii Revised Statutes, to mean any condition
determined by the certifying physician or advanced
practice registered nurse to be appropriate for the medical use of cannabis
;
(2)
Inserting
language to amend the definition of "waiting room" in section 329D-1,
Hawaii Revised Statutes, to include
an area where hemp
can be sold, including but not limited to hemp products and accessories to the
use of medical cannabis, such as rolling papers, rolling trays, grinders, and
vaporizers
;
(3)
Inserting
language to amend section 329D-6(r), Hawaii Revised Statutes, to:
(A)
Require that cannabis and manufactured
cannabis products purchased by a dispensary from another dispensary pursuant to

(i)
When intended for direct retail sale to the
patient, meet all applicable packaging, labeling, and testing requirements at
the time of transport to the purchasing licensee's production center or one of
its retail locations; and
(ii)
When intended for further manufacturing by the
purchasing dispensary at the time of transportation, be transported to the
purchasing licensee's production center; and
(B)
Require
the
selling dispensary to
submit a transport manifest of the cannabis or manufactured cannabis products
to be sold to the Department of Health before the sale is made, after which the
selling dispensary may immediately proceed with the transfer of the cannabis or
manufactured cannabis products;

enforce, and mitigate nuisances relating to, chapter 329D, Hawaii Revised
Statutes;
(5)
Amending section 1 to reflect its amended
purpose;
(6)
Inserting an effective date of December 31,
2050, to encourage further discussion; and

Making technical, nonsubstantive amendments
for the purposes of clarity and consistency.

records of votes of the members of your Committees on Health and Human Services
and Commerce and Consumer Protection that are attached to this report, your
Committees are in accord with the intent and purpose of H.B. No. 302, H.D. 2,
as amended herein, and recommend that it pass Second Reading in the form
attached hereto as H.B. No. 302, H.D. 2, S.D. 1, and be referred
