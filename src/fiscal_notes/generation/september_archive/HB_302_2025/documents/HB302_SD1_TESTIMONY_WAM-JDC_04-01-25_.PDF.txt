Chairs Rhoads and Dela Cruz and Members of the Committees: 
The Department of the Attorney General (Department) provides the following 
comments. 
The purpose of this bill is to enhance and expand access to medical cannabis 
from licensed medical cannabis dispensaries in the State while discouraging 
participation in the illicit cannabis market by, among other things: (1) amending the 
definition of “debilitating condition” in section 329-121, Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS), 
to mean any condition determined by the certifying physician or advanced practice 
registered nurse to be appropriate for the medical use of cannabis; (2) establishing the 
offense of unauthorized operation of a dispensary to prohibit the operation of a 
dispensary without a license and to prohibit the operation of any search platform, web 
hosting service, or social media platform that advertises the sale of cannabis by an 
unlicensed person or entity; (3) requiring the licensure of cannabis cultivators and 
establishing a Cannabis Cultivator License Program in chapter 329D, HRS; and (4) 
appropriating funds out of the Medical Cannabis Registry and Regulation Special Fund 
for the Department to enforce and mitigate nuisances relating to chapter 329D, HRS, 
with the funds to be expended by the Director of Health. 
First, subsection (a) of the first new section to be added to chapter 329D, HRS, 
on page 9, lines 13-16, establishes a criminal offense for unlicensed operation of a 

Testimony of the Department of the Attorney General 
Thirty-Third Legislature, 2025 
Page 2 of 3 
 
dispensary; however, the required state of mind is not clearly stated.  For this provision 
to be effective and to eliminate ambiguity in enforcement, we recommend amending 
subsection (a) to read:  "No person shall intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly operate a 
dispensary without a license from the department pursuant to this chapter." 
While subsection (d) of the new section on page 10, lines 7-8, provides that a 
violation of subsection (a) is a class C felony, the penalty for a violation of subsection 
(b) on page 9, line 17, to page 10, line 2, is unclear.  To make it clear what the 
consequence of a violation of subsection (a) is, we recommend adding a second 
sentence to subsection (d) on page 10, line 8, to read: "Any person who violates 
subsection (b) shall be guilty of a  
 
." 
Second, section 329-130, HRS, allows for only two types of producers of medical 
cannabis: medical cannabis dispensary licensees and qualified patients.  The cultivator 
licenses proposed by this bill would not be subject to the same cannabis production 
regulations as dispensaries, and that raises concerns for the health and safety of 
medical cannabis patients.  Cannabis produced by cultivator licensees would be 
untracked, unregulated, and untested until the product is distributed to a medical 
cannabis dispensary, so until the product gets to a dispensary, the Department of 
Health (DOH) would have no idea how many plants, or what kinds of cannabis products 
the cultivator licensee has.  This gives the cultivator licensee the opportunity to sell or 
distribute cannabis products illegally without DOH ever knowing.  If there is a market 
need for additional medical cannabis, an alternative to cultivator licenses would be to 
amend the existing medical cannabis dispensary administrative rules to allow 
dispensaries to grow more plants.  Creating a new type of medical cannabis producer 
would also require DOH to use additional resources for oversight and enforcement. 
We note that on page 12, line 12, the number of cannabis cultivator licenses is 
currently not specified.  If the Legislature intends to create cultivator licenses, we 
recommend keeping the number of licenses low to ensure that DOH is able to regulate 
licensed cultivators. 
Third, section 11 of the bill, at page 15, lines 10-18, appropriates money "for the 
department of the attorney general to enforce, and mitigate nuisances relating to, 

Testimony of the Department of the Attorney General 
Thirty-Third Legislature, 2025 
Page 3 of 3 
 
chapter 329D, Hawaii Revised Statutes."  Page 15, lines 14-16.  To ensure that the 
Department’s drug nuisance abatement unit is able to enforce against nuisances 
relating to chapter 329D, HRS, under section 28-131, HRS, we recommend amending 
the first sentence of section 28-131(c), HRS, as follows: 
(c)  The purpose of the drug nuisance abatement unit shall be to 
provide for the effective enforcement and prosecution of those violations 
of the drug nuisance abatement laws under chapter 712, part V but only 
for offenses related to drugs and intoxicating compounds as provided 
under chapter 712, part IV[.] and violations of chapter 329D as provided 
under section 712-1270. . . . 
Finally, to allow for more streamlined expenditure of funds for drug nuisance 
abatement, we request that the expending agency in section 11, at page 15, lines 17-
18, be changed from the Department of Health to the Department of the Attorney 
General, as follows: 
The sums appropriated shall be expended by the [director of health] 
attorney general for the purposes of this part. 
We respectfully ask the Committees to make the recommended amendments if 
the bill is to pass.  Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments.

Testimony COMMENTING on  HB302_HD2_SD1 
RELATING TO CANNABIS 
SENATOR DONOVAN M. DELA CRUZ, CHAIR 
SENATE COMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS 
 
SENATOR KARL RHOADS, CHAIR 
SENATE COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY 
 
Hearing Date:  April 1, 2025,  
Room Number:  211 
 
Department Position: The Department of Health (“Department”) submits testimony 
1 
commenting on this measure. 
2 
Department Testimony:  The Department appreciates the intent of HB302 HD2 to reduce 
3 
barriers to medical cannabis access and offers the following comments on the amendments added 
4 
to HB302 HD2 SD1.  
5 
Removal of Qualifying Conditions 
6 
HB302 HD2 SD1 removes all specific qualifying conditions for the medical use of cannabis and 
7 
replaces them with a broad provision allowing certification for “any condition determined by the 
8 
certifying physician or advanced practice registered nurse to be appropriate for the medical use 
9 
of cannabis.” See page 2, line 17, through page 4, line 3. 
10 
While the Department supports allowing medical providers to use their professional judgment in 
11 
diagnosing and treating patients, there is limited scientific evidence supporting the use of 
12 
cannabis for conditions beyond those currently listed in statute. The Department is particularly 
13 
concerned about potential risks to patient safety, including adverse drug interactions between 
14 
cannabis and a patient’s existing treatment plan.

Therefore, if the Legislature intends to retain this amendment, the Department respectfully 
1 
requests that only a patient’s treating physician or treating APRN be authorized to certify the use 
2 
of cannabis for conditions not currently listed as qualifying conditions. This can be accomplished 
3 
by replacing Section 2 of the bill with the amendments provided below. We have included in the 
4 
amendments the ability for a hospice provider to certify a patient for the medical use of cannabis. 
5 
Unauthorized operation of a dispensary  
6 
Section 8 of the measure would make it unlawful to operate a medical cannabis dispensary 
7 
without a license and gives the Department the authority to issue cease-and-desist orders to 
8 
violators. See page 9, line 10, through page 11, line 19. Initially, we note that it is already 
9 
unlawful to operate a dispensary without a license, and criminal penalties exist for manufacturing 
10 
and distributing cannabis. Additionally, the Department has concerns regarding the lack of 
11 
appropriate resources necessary to effectively implement this new regulatory responsibility, as 
12 
well as safety concerns for regulators inspecting and issuing administrative orders to entities 
13 
violating criminal law. The Department believes that these types of violations are better handled 
14 
by law enforcement agencies. 
15 
The Department also respectfully notes that on page 11, lines 13-19, the proposed enforcement 
16 
authority contains an exception for hemp processors and retailers, as well as primary caregivers. 
17 
These entities would not be considered unlicensed medical cannabis dispensaries if they are 
18 
operating within their legal authority. Allowing an exception for these entities could 
19 
unintentionally create a loophole in the law allowing an unlicensed dispensary to obtain a hemp 
20 
processor permit or claim to be a caregiver and market illicit cannabis without being subjected to 
21 
the new enforcement authority proposed in this measure. If the Legislature intends to move the 
22 
bill forward with this section, we recommend deleting the exception on page 11, lines 13-19. 
23 
Dispensary Waiting Room: Sale of Hemp Products and Accessories 
24 
The bill redefines a medical cannabis dispensary’s “waiting room” to allow the sale of hemp 
25 
products and paraphernalia, such as rolling papers and vaporizers. See page 4, lines 17-20. We 
26 
note that a “waiting room” is an area for people who are “waiting for, assisting, or 
27 

HB302_HD2_SD1 
Page 3 of 15 
 
 
accompanying” a patient that is purchasing medical cannabis. Cannabis cannot be stored or sold 
1 
in a waiting room, and entry is restricted to patients and their companions. 
2 
The Department is concerned that the proposed amendment could inadvertently transform the 
3 
waiting room into a secondary retail space that would attract non-patients into the dispensary, 
4 
potentially blurring the distinction between areas accessible to the public and areas restricted to 
5 
patients and their companions. 
6 
Currently, state-compliant hemp products may be sold within a dispensary’s retail area, and the 
7 
rules can be amended to allow certain paraphernalia to be sold there as well. Since patients 
8 
already have access to these products in the retail area, and given concerns that the waiting room 
9 
could become a secondary retail space, the Department requests that the waiting room remain 
10 
dedicated to its primary purpose—providing a space for patients and their companions to wait 
11 
within the dispensary. This approach will help prevent non-patient traffic and maintain a clear 
12 
distinction between public retail areas and patient-only spaces. 
13 
Establishing New Cannabis Cultivator Licenses. 
14 
The Department appreciates the intent to expand opportunities in the medical cannabis market by 
15 
including cannabis cultivators. However, we note that the measure does not provide funding to 
16 
support the implementation and regulation of this new license type, which will include drafting 
17 
new regulations and procuring new software for licensing and tracking cultivated cannabis. 
18 
Additionally, the Department is concerned that an oversupply of cannabis, without a 
19 
corresponding increase in patient demand, could leave newly licensed cultivators without a 
20 
market, potentially leading to diversion into unregulated channels. While the bill includes 
21 
provisions aimed at increasing patient demand, we request that the cultivator licenses have a 
22 
delayed effective date of July 1, 2026. This delay would allow time to assess the bill’s impact, 
23 
develop necessary regulations, and implement IT systems to support the expanded program.

Offered Amendments: 
1 
SECTION A.  Section 329-121, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is 
2 
amended as follows: 
3 
"Qualifying patient" means a person who:  
4 
(1) has been diagnosed as having a debilitating medical 
5 
condition[.] by a physician or advanced practice registered 
6 
nurse who has certified in writing that, in the physician's 
7 
or advanced practice registered nurse's professional 
8 
opinion, the potential benefits of the medical use of 
9 
cannabis would likely outweigh the health risks for 
10 
patient;  
11 
(2) has been diagnosed as having a condition other than a 
12 
debilitating medical condition by the patient's primary 
13 
treating medical provider who has certified in writing 
14 
that, in the physician's or advanced practice registered 
15 
nurse's professional opinion, the potential benefits of the 
16 
medical use of cannabis would likely outweigh the health 
17 
risks for the patient; or 
18 
(3) is receiving hospice care and the hospice provider is 
19 
licensed in Hawaii and has certified in writing that the 
20 
patient is receiving hospice care.  
21 

HB302_HD2_SD1 
Page 5 of 15 
 
 
"Written certification" means the qualifying patient's 
1 
medical records or a statement signed by a qualifying patient's 
2 
physician [or] advanced practice registered nurse, or hospice 
3 
provider stating that in [the physician's or advanced practice 
4 
registered nurse’s] their professional opinion, the qualifying 
5 
patient has a condition for which [debilitating medical 
6 
condition and] the potential benefits of the medical use of 
7 
marijuana would likely outweigh the health risks for the 
8 
qualifying patient.  The department of health may require, 
9 
through its rulemaking authority, that all written 
10 
certifications comply with a designated form.  "Written 
11 
certifications" are valid for one year from the time of signing; 
12 
provided the department of health may allow for the validity of 
13 
any written certification for three years if the qualifying 
14 
patient's physician or advanced practice registered nurse states 
15 
that the patient's [debilitating medical] condition is chronic 
16 
in nature. 
17 
SECTION B.  Section 329-121, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is 
18 
amended by adding a new definition to be appropriately inserted 
19 
and to read as follows: 
20 
""Primary treating medical provider" means a physician or 
21 
advanced practice registered nurse located in Hawaii and with an 
22 

HB302_HD2_SD1 
Page 6 of 15 
 
 
active unrestricted license to practice in Hawaii, who, within 
1 
that person’s scope of practice and individual competency, is 
2 
primarily responsible for the treatment and ongoing care of the 
3 
patient’s condition and determines that the potential benefits 
4 
of medical cannabis use are likely to outweigh the associated 
5 
health risks for the patient." 
6 
SECTION C.  Section 329-122, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is 
7 
amended to read as follows: 
8 
" (a) Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the medical 
9 
use of cannabis by a qualifying patient age eighteen years or 
10 
older shall be permitted only if: 
11 
(1) [The qualifying patient has been diagnosed by a 
12 
physician as having a debilitating medical condition] The 
13 
physician, advanced practice registered nurse, or hospice

17 
patient’s medical record; and 
18 
(2)  The qualifying patient's physician or advanced practice 
19 
registered nurse has certified in writing that, in the 
20 
physician's or advanced practice registered nurse’s professional 
21 
opinion, the potential benefits of the medical use of marijuana 
22 

HB302_HD2_SD1 
Page 7 of 15 
 
 
would likely outweigh the health risks for the particular 
1 
qualifying patient; and  
2 
(3)]  The amount of cannabis does not exceed an adequate 
3

department may inspect a qualifying patient’s medical records of 
13 
the physician, advanced practice registered nurse, or hospice

patient. 
16 
(b)  The department may suspend or revoke the ability to

DECISION MAKING 
 
Tuesday, April 1, 2025 – 10:00 AM 
Conference Room 211 & Videoconference, State Capitol  
 
This bill is very important for patients who have difficulty attending in-person certification 
evaluations, especially those patients on outer islands where access to certifying 
providers is limited. 
 
SD1 also improves patient access by adding a provision that would allow certifying 
providers to determine qualifying conditions, as is already the case in several states. 
 
However, this bill contains a serious flaw (See Page 15, Line 5): 
 
“Any fees assessed by a certifying physician or advanced practice registered nurse to 
issue a written certification for a qualifying patient shall not exceed an amount equal to 
three times the amount of the fee charged by the department of health to issue a 
registration certificate pursuant to subsection (b)." 
 
The State should not be deciding how much medical providers can charge for their 
services.  This falls outside the State’s authority over commerce, and should be left to 
the ethical practice of medicine by the certifying provider. 

HB302 HD2 SD1-WRITTEN TESTIMONY-OTTO-01APR25 
2 
 
Rather than trying to restrict how much certifying providers can charge for their time, a 
better approach is to raise the bar for certification evaluations by requiring that certifying 
providers demonstrate competency in Cannabinoid Medicine before being allowed to 
issue Written Certifications.  This would improve patient safety and highlight the value of 
the certification evaluation and ongoing medical supervision. 
 
Please correct this part of the bill by making the following amendment: 
 
SECTION 10.  
 
Section 329-123, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (a) to 
read as follows:  “(a)  Physicians or advanced practice registered nurses who issue 
written certifications shall provide, in each written certification, the name, address, 
patient identification number, and other identifying information of the qualifying 
patient.  The department of health shall require, in rules adopted pursuant to chapter 91, 
that all written certifications comply with a designated form completed by or on behalf of 
a qualifying patient.  The form shall require information from the applicant, primary 
caregiver, and physician or advanced practice registered nurse as specifically required 
or permitted by this chapter.  The form shall require the address of the location where 
the cannabis is grown and shall appear on the registry card issued by the department of 
health.  The certifying physician or advanced practice registered nurse shall be required 
to have a bona fide physician-patient relationship or bona fide advanced practice 
registered nurse-patient relationship, as applicable, with the qualifying patient; provided 
that after August 31, 2025, certifying physicians and advanced practice registered 
nurses shall be required to complete a minimum of eight hours of accredited continuing 
education in medical cannabis before issuing written certifications.  All current active 
medical cannabis permits shall be honored through their expiration date.”

Dear Chairs Dela Cruz, Rhoads, Vice-Chairs Moriwaki, Gabbard and Members of the 
Committees: 
Aloha Green Apothecary (“Aloha”) is a state licensed medical cannabis dispensary in 
Honolulu. Aloha supportsHB302, HD2, SD1 which eases access issues for medical 
cannabis patients, but we request two (2) amendments to the bill for limited advertising 
and to add back language which was removed in the prior committee with changes 
addressing DOH and AG concerns by limiting the initial interim patient purchase during 
the period a patient is waiting for their 329 card to less than the petty misdemeanor 
possession amount to help avoid patient access delays.   
When created in 2015, the medical cannabis dispensary laws were one of the most 
rigorous and strict systems amongst the dozens of states that allowed medical 
cannabis.  Since that time, the nation’s landscape and our state’s attitudes over 
cannabis have also changed dramatically such that many states allow for adult use, and 

 
 
 
our state has decriminalized non-medical use. There is a thriving illicit market that 
makes it easy and cheaper to access cannabis, and there is now increased availability 
of THC through hemp-derived products. Yet, Hawaii’s medical cannabis system has 
hardly changed.  
This appears to be one of the driving reasons why the number of registered patients has 
declined 15% over the past 3 years.  While Aloha continues to provide safe products 
that are tracked from seed to sale, 3rd party lab tested against impurities and pesticides, 
labeled with dosage and warnings – less patients are getting their cannabis from 
dispensaries due to price and ease. 
The purpose of this bill is to ease some of the archaic hurdles in the law that have been 
in place since 2015 that no longer seem necessary.  The laws on telehealth were 
already revised in 2021 for parity of in-person and telehealth visits to create a bona fide 
physician-patient relationship, except for opiates and medical cannabis. That distinction 
for medical cannabis at this stage appears arbitrary, and the bill proposes to eliminate 
that difference.  
The bill in its original and HD1 form, also had language to allows a qualifying patient 
immediate access to enter a dispensary and purchase a limited amount of medical 
cannabis upon the Department of Health’s registry system recognizing the submission 
of a complete application.  Currently, a patient may wait anywhere from 3 days to a 
week to obtain their medical cannabis card or “329 card” which will then allow them to 
enter into a licensed dispensary.  This delay is often a significant barrier for patients 
who need their cannabis medication right away.  It not only is a possible deterrent to 
obtain a 329 card, but can also serve to push a patient towards obtaining product from 
the illicit market.  
In order to address concerns of the Department of Health and AG about this immediate 
access, we suggest amendments so that the first purchase can only be in an amount up 
to the decriminalized amount limit for a petty misdemeanor which is currently at 3 
grams. A petty misdemeanor is only punishable with a fine by law enforcement.  
While it is true some patients upon submission to the DOH get a quick response and 
obtain their registration, we are also aware of instances that have take a few to several 
days.  Moreover, should a patient submit their documentation just prior to or on a 
weekend, they will most certainly need to wait a few days. 
We also disagree that a patient who had immediate access would ever likely be 
prosecuted.  They would have their certifying documentation from a health provider, 
they would have a labeled packaged product identifying that it came from a dispensary. 
But, if it would help achieve a more acceptable approach, Aloha would propose 
lessening the amount to the petty misdemeanor amount punishable by a fine in the 
unlikely case law enforcement would pursue possession charges against a medical 
cannabis patient with proper documentation and medical cannabis in proper medical 
packaging.  

 
 
 
Therefore, we respectfully request that the committee amend the bill by adding back in 
the following language.  
1. Immediate Qualified Patient Access  
In Section 2 of the bill, the language in yellow highlight be added:  
 "(a)  Physicians or advanced practice registered nurses who 
issue written certifications shall provide, in each written 
certification, the name, address, patient identification number, 
and other identifying information of the qualifying 
patient.  The department of health shall require, in rules 
adopted pursuant to chapter 91, that all written certifications 
comply with a designated form completed by or on behalf of a 
qualifying patient.  The form shall require information from the 
applicant, primary caregiver, and physician or advanced practice 
registered nurse as specifically required or permitted by this 
chapter.  The form shall require the address of the location 
where the cannabis is grown and shall appear on the registry 
card issued by the department of health.  The certifying 
physician or advanced practice registered nurse shall be 
required to have a bona fide physician-patient relationship or 
bona fide advanced practice registered nurse-patient 
relationship, as applicable, with the qualifying patient[.]; 
provided that nothing under this part shall require that the 
bona fide physician-patient relationship or bona fide advanced 
practice registered nurse-patient relationship be established by 
conducting an initial in-person consultation.  After the 
submission of the applicant's form but before receipt of 
confirmed registration from the department of health, the 
department shall issue a temporary identification number that 
the applicant or primary caregiver may use as proof and 
documentation authorizing the applicant or primary caregiver to 
enter and make a one-time purchase of cannabis from a medical 
cannabis dispensary licensed under chapter 329D in an amount at 
or less than the amount that can be possessed under section 712-
1249(2) as a violation.  The department of health office of 
medical cannabis control and regulation shall facilitate the 
temporary authorization for applicants and primary caregivers, 
but shall be able to cancel or terminate any such authorization 
within 30 days if the department finds the application to be 
incomplete or invalid  All current active medical cannabis 
permits shall be honored through their expiration date." 
 
 

 
 
 
2. Limited Advertising  
Secondly while the law only provides that the department “shall establish standards 
regarding advertising. . .” HRS 329D-11(a), the interim administrative rules prohibit 
advertising. HAR Section 111-850-145(a).  As such, we would propose that the statute 
be amended to provide the DOH discretionary language so that it would override the 
prohibitive administrative rules by amending subsection (d) in that section of 329D-11 to 
read: 
“The department shall be authorized to: 
(1) approve a dispensary to advertise so long as the advertisement is not 
targeted to minors, and does not promote smoking or displays the activity of 
smoking in a positive manner, and 
(2) allow dispensaries to provide, disseminate, and publish educational and 
scientific materials relating to medical cannabis and its approved products and 
sponsor events about medical cannabis. 
Allowing some form of advertising may improve declining patient numbers in order to 
justify additional cultivation licenses.  
 
 
3. Number and Size of Proposed Cultivation License  
 
Finally, in response to the concerns about allowing additional cultivation licenses when 
the number of 329 medical patients has fallen over the past 3 years; we ask the 
committees to amend the bill to limit the number of cultivation licenses based on the 
number of patients to balance supply and demand, and set the maximum cultivation 
license square footage at 2000 square feet in accordance to the cultivation licenses 
proposed in the dual-use bills in the past 2 years.  One only has to look to the mainland 
to see the negative effects an oversupply of cannabis may have on the regulated 
industry when an illicit market continues untouched by law enforcement.  
 
The dispensary system has a demand issue, not a supply issue. The demand for 
cannabis is not declining, but the demand to become a 329 patient is in decline. As with 
our medical cannabis edible products, we encourage the committees to start low and go 
slow. The state can decide the number of licenses based on market conditions and 
patient demand.  
 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify.

Re:  Testimony In Support with Requested Amendments on House Bill (HB) 
302, House Draft (HD) 2, Senate Draft (SD) 1 
RELATING TO CANNABIS 
 
Dear Chairs Rhoads, Dela Cruz, Vice-Chairs Gabbard and Moriwaki and Members the 
Committee: 
The Hawaiʻi Cannabis Industry Association, represents a majority of the state’s licensed 
medical cannabis dispensaries. HICIA supports HB302, HD1, SD1 which eases access 
issues for medical cannabis patients, but oppose the addition of cultivation licenses and 
we have some requested amendments. The purpose of this bill is to ease some of the 
archaic hurdles in the law that no longer seem necessary.   
TELEHEALTH 
The bill would allow the physician or advanced practice registered nurse relationship to 
the patient to be established via telehealth, instead of requiring it in person.  This will 
help with access, especially for remove and rural communities.  The general laws on 
telehealth were already revised in 2021 for parity of in-person and telehealth visits to 
create a bona fide physician-patient relationship and so this bill would eliminate the 
restriction for medical cannabis.  
QUALIFYING CONDITION 
The SD1 was amended so that the list of qualifying conditions is no longer prescriptive 
and explicit, and instead, allow a physician or advanced practice registered nurse to 
certify for any condition where the patient may benefit.  While this change may not result 
in a significant increase of qualifying patients, we support this change as a better 
reflection of the evolving medical science around cannabis benefits, but also upholds 
the doctor-patient relationship.  
WAITING ROOM 

 
Hawaiʻi Cannabis Industry Association (HICIA) 
220 S King St #1600, Honolulu, HI 96813 
www.808hcia.com 
 
 
Currently, dispensaries are unable to conduct any sales of even non-cannabis products 
in the waiting room area.  We support the SD1 amendment in this bill that would allow 
already legal hemp products as well as certain paraphernalia to be sold in the waiting 
room. This will help qualifying patients more easily obtain all of their cannabis and 
cannabis related purchases all in one location.  
PROCESS FOR DISPENSARY-TO-DISPENSARY SALES 
We support the changes made in the SD1 to add more clarifying language on the 
process for dispensaries to sell product to another dispensary.  The current process can 
take 30 days or more and this impacts the quality of the product and is an unnecessary 
delay.  This new language would provide for a more efficient system, while still 
upholding all of the requirements.  
CULTIVATION LICENSES 
The HICIA does not support these new provisions of the bill.  These licensees would be 
growing more cannabis to provide to an already extremely limited and constrained 
marketplace since products would/should be sold through licensed dispensaries retail 
locations.  
However, the current number of qualified patients is lower than it’s been in the last 3 
years. While the number of registered medical cannabis patients reached its peak in 
August 2021, with 35,444 card-holding patients, since then, the number of patients has 
decreased over fifteen per cent to 30,035 by November 2024. 
This means there are less patients qualified to purchase medical cannabis.  Licensees 
already have production centers that are underutilized and not growing at full capacity 
just to serve their own patient customer base. Adding additional products into this 
already tight legal system through cultivator licensees will simply flood the market with 
more product.  This product will end up somewhere, and if not in licensed facilities, 
more likely in the illicit market. 
And while it would be nice to believe that cannabis from cultivator licenses could result 
in lower cost cannabis for qualified patients, HICIA does not believe that will be 
possible.  Cannabis produced under HRS Chapter 329D is heavily regulated with some 
of the most rigorous and stringent rules in the nation.  Seed-to-production tracking, 
laboratory testing, requirements for background checked and monitored employees, 
security systems and other regulations applicable to dispensary production centers will 
likewise apply to cultivator licensees.  These operational burdens all increase costs for 

 
Hawaiʻi Cannabis Industry Association (HICIA) 
220 S King St #1600, Honolulu, HI 96813 
www.808hcia.com 
 
 
production and more than likely, mean cultivator licensed products, if allowed, would be 
as costly, if not moreso due to their limited and smaller scale 
REQUESTED AMENDMENTS 
The HICIA requests the committee consider adding in two amendments: (1) immediate 
access for patients without having to wait for a 329 card; and (2)  
1) IMMEDIATE ACCESS 
The bill in its original and HD1 form, also had language to allows a qualifying patient 
immediate access to enter a dispensary and purchase a limited amount of medical 
cannabis upon the Department of Health’s registry system recognizing the submission 
of a complete application.  Currently, a patient may wait anywhere from 3 days to a 
week to obtain their medical cannabis card or “329 card” which will then allow them to 
enter into a licensed dispensary.  This delay is often a significant barrier for patients 
who need their cannabis medication right away.  It not only is a possible deterrent to 
obtain a 329 card but can also serve to push a patient towards obtaining product from 
the illicit market.  
Therefore, we respectfully request that the committee amend the bill by adding back in 
the following language, but only up to the amount of cannabis that is considered 
decriminalized under HRS 712-1249, or three grams.  
In Section 4 of the bill, the language in yellow highlight be added back in:  
 "(a)  Physicians or advanced practice registered nurses who 
issue written certifications shall provide, in each written 
certification, the name, address, patient identification number, 
and other identifying information of the qualifying 
patient.  The department of health shall require, in rules 
adopted pursuant to chapter 91, that all written certifications 
comply with a designated form completed by or on behalf of a 
qualifying patient.  The form shall require information from the 
applicant, primary caregiver, and physician or advanced practice 
registered nurse as specifically required or permitted by this 
chapter.  The form shall require the address of the location 
where the cannabis is grown and shall appear on the registry 
card issued by the department of health.  The certifying 
physician or advanced practice registered nurse shall be 
required to have a bona fide physician-patient relationship or

bona fide advanced practice registered nurse-patient 
relationship, as applicable, with the qualifying patient[.]; 
provided that nothing under this part shall require that the 
bona fide physician-patient relationship or bona fide advanced 
practice registered nurse-patient relationship be established by 
conducting an initial in-person consultation.  After the 
submission of the applicant's form but before receipt of 
confirmed registration from the department of health, the 
department shall issue a temporary identification number that 
the applicant or primary caregiver may use as proof and 
documentation authorizing the applicant or primary caregiver to 
enter and make a one-time purchase of cannabis from a medical 
cannabis dispensary licensed under chapter 329D in an amount at 
or less than the amount that can be possessed under section 712-
1249(2) as a violation.  The department of health office of 
medical cannabis control and regulation shall facilitate the 
temporary authorization for applicants and primary caregivers, 
but shall be able to cancel or terminate any such authorization 
within 30 days if the department finds the application to be 
incomplete or invalid.  All current active medical cannabis 
permits shall be honored through their expiration date." 
2) ADVERTISING 
While the law only provides that the department “shall establish standards regarding 
advertising. . .” HRS 329D-11(a), the interim administrative rules prohibit advertising. 
HAR Section 111-850-145(a).  As such, we would propose that the statute be amended 
to provide the DOH discretionary language so that it would override the prohibitive 
administrative rules by amending subsection (d) in that section of 329D-11 to read: 
§329D-11  Advertising and packaging.  (d)  The department shall be 
authorized to: 
(1) approve a dispensary to advertise so long as the advertisement is not 
targeted to minors, and does not promote smoking or displays the activity 
of smoking in a positive manner, and 
(2) allow dispensaries to provide, disseminate, and publish educational 
and scientific materials relating to medical cannabis and its approved 
products and sponsor events about medical cannabis. 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify.

In Support of HB 302, SD 1  
 
 
 
Aloha Chairs Rhoads and Dela Cruz, Vice Chairs Gabbard and Moriwaki, and distinguished 
members of the Senate Judiciary and Ways and Means Committees: 
 
My name is Karen O’Keefe. I am the director of state policies for the nonprofit Marijuana 
Policy Project (MPP), the largest cannabis policy reform organization in the nation. We urge 
you to report HB 302, SD 1 favorably to improve Hawaii’s medical cannabis program. This 
important bill would treat medical cannabis more like other prescription medications by 
allowing medical cannabis certifications by telehealth and by allowing physicians to certify 
patients for cannabis for any medical condition.  
 
Medical cannabis patients should be allowed to have all consultations, including their initial 
one, via telehealth, as is allowed for most prescription medications. 
 
Medical schools generally do not educate doctors about medical cannabis, and many 
physicians do not feel knowledgeable about it.1 As a result, many patients who were 
diagnosed by one practitioner go to a medical cannabis specialist for their certification. 
There is no need to require a patient to visit with their medical cannabis practitioner 
in-person. This requirement drives up costs and burdens on patients and steers them to 
whichever practitioner is on their island — even if it is not the practitioner who the patient 
would like to advise them about medical cannabis. 
 
HB 302, SD 1 would also allow doctors and advanced practice registered nurses to certify 
patients for any condition they determine to be appropriate for the medical use of cannabis. 
This change is long overdue. Practitioners can prescribe far more dangerous medications 
off-label, and they should be able to certify patients for medical cannabis when they feel it 
is appropriate, too. 
 
Allowing doctors and APRNs to certify by telehealth and to recommend cannabis for any 
medical condition will also increase the number of individuals who can access lab-tested, 
regulated medical cannabis, reducing the number relying on unregulated illicit cannabis 
and the untested intoxicating hemp market.

 Opposition to HB302 
 
Dear Committee Chairs and vice chairs. 
The Oahu Cannabis Farms Alliance opposes HB302. 
You are not listening to us, so we the people are taking upon ourselves, in the private 
sector, to host a roll call vote across the islands.    
YES – 5000 square feet canopy flowering space 
NO - card limits   
NO - caregiver limits  

NO - Law enforcement for medical cannabis cultivation 
 
In the state of Maine, the medical program is flourishing, and licensed growers and 
manufacturers are selling directly to patients and providing cannabis medicine to 
dispensaries if they choose to.  These licensees are being tracked strictly through their tax 
reporting and are not being tracked through failed testing programs and metrics. 
We also recommend a 5,000 sq ft flowering limit so if cultivation licenses are adopted the 
market can be resilient and not attract large scale growers outside of the state. 
OFCA has provided testimony for the state clearly showing the asks of medical patients. 
Large cooperative farms have collected data on patients’ needs throughout the state, with 
one cooperative farm having over 4,000 members using their grow site as a data point. ***

RE: 
H.B. 302, HD2, SD1 – Relating to Cannabis 
Hearing Date: Tuesday, April 1, 2025 at 10:00 a.m. 
Conference Room: 211 
 
Dear Chair Dela Cruz, Chair Rhoads, and Members of the Joint Committees: 
 
We submit this testimony on behalf of Cure Oahu support the intent of H.B. 302, 
HD2, SD1, Relating to Cannabis, which makes numerous amendments to the 
medical cannabis law including: 1) amending the definition of "debilitating medical 
condition," 2) allowing for hemp and paraphernalia sales in waiting room, 3) allowing 
a provider-patient relationship to be established by telehealth, 4) streamlining 
wholesale transport between dispensaries, 5) adding enforcement provisions to 
allow Department of Health to issue a cease and desist notice to violators of the 
cannabis dispensary law, 6) establishing a cannabis cultivator license to authorize 
the cultivation and distribution of cannabis plants, and 7) authorizing expenditures 
from the Medical Cannabis Registry and Regulation Special Fund to fund nuisance 
abatement enforcement activities.  
 
Cure Oahu supports various parts of this bill because it streamlines many 
operational issues facing medical cannabis dispensaries – including improving the 
registration process for patients and caregivers, allowing for hemp and paraphernalia 
sales in waiting rooms, allowing a provider-patient relationship to be established by 
telehealth and streamlining wholesale transport between dispensaries.  
 
We also support the first part of Section 8 of this bill (page 9, line 10-page 11 line 19) 
which seeks to provide Department of Health with clear enforcement tools to shut 
down illegal websites that are significantly impacting the regulated medical cannabis 
industry. There are numerous websites that are currently operating and advertising 
their sale of cannabis products, some of which acknowledge that Hawaii is a medical 
cannabis only state, but some that do not and still openly sell cannabis products.

SanHi Government Strategies

The number of registered medical cannabis patients has been in decline since 2021.  
There are various issues with the registration process - including the limited number 
of providers participating in the certification process, the costs incurred by patients 
as part of the certification process, and the proliferation of illicit market products.  
 
We believe that access to medical cannabis should be as streamlined as possible to 
ensure that patients can obtain their medical cannabis cards and access medical 
cannabis in a way that keeps patients and the public safe rather than bypassing the 
medical program altogether.  
 
We would like to note our concerns regarding the second part of section 8 of the bill 
(page 11, line 20 – page 13, line 2) which proposes to add new cultivator-only 
licenses to the program. We are concerned the current market is not robust enough 
to support cultivators, given existing medical cannabis dispensaries are still 
struggling. We request that section be removed, or that at a minimum, cultivator 
licenses only be permitted when the threshold for medical cannabis patients reaches

Re: 
In SUPPORT with requested amendments and comments on HB302, HD2, SD1 Relating to 
Medical Cannabis 
Aloha Chairs Rhoads and Dela Cruz:  
Big Island Grown Dispensaries is one of eight medical cannabis dispensary licensees in the State.  We 
operate production facilities and 3 retail locations on the Big Island of Hawaii.  In addition, our medical 
cannabis operation currently employs over 55 Big Island residents.   
 
Mahalo for the opportunity to provide testimony in SUPPORT of HB302 with requested amendments 
and comments on the HD2, SD1 version of the bill.   
 
Cannabis sales in Hawaii are currently uncontrolled and dominated by illicit sales that risks public health 
and safety. As a licensed medical dispensary, we have seen the first-hand effects of the unregulated/illicit 
market on the legal industry serving patients. Over the past three and a half years, the number of 
registered cannabis patients has declined by roughly 15%.  
 
Hawaii’s medical dispensary program is suffering from regulatory barriers that make operations difficult 
to sustain while facing increasing threats of competition from the unregulated market- from street sales to 
the proliferation of unregulated [high potency] THC cannabis, sold under the guise of being hemp, 
currently available at retailers across the islands. The Hawaii State Medical Cannabis Program is in 
decline and requires meaningful policy that will lower the barrier to entry for patients to access the legal 
dispensary system while maintaining quality standards for licensees that ensure access to clean [free of 
pesticides, additives, residual chemicals] and tested cannabis for consumers.  
 
This measure seeks to address one of the regulatory barriers that impacts patients access to medical 
cannabis by allowing physicians and their patients to utilize telemedicine for their initial consultation. 
However, we believe the measure can be strengthened further with the following amendments: 
 
(1) Allow Instant Access/Sales. Patients currently must wait days to receive a card from the Department 
of Health that allows them to purchase cannabis after their physician consultation. No other medicine 
requires such delays. Moreover, this delay leads patients to the unregulated market where untested, 
and potentially pesticide ridden cannabis is easier and faster to secure. In turn, this risks the health

and safety of patients, not to mention the public. Legal access to medical cannabis via the dispensary 
system should be immediate following certification by a provider.  
 
We implore you to make the logical move of allowing for immediate access to enter a legal 
dispensary and purchase the currently decriminalized amount of 3 grams of medical cannabis 
upon the Department of Health’s registry system recognizing the submission of a complete 
application. This is a very reasonable and meaningful change to the program that centers around 
serving patients more promptly in providing access to clean, tested cannabis medicine that is 
produced in facilities that continue to meet the highest state standards for production. 
 
(2) Reconsider the amendment allowing for additional cultivation licenses [at this time]. The dispensary 
system has a demand issue not a supply issue. The demand for cannabis is not declining, but the 
demand to become a legal/329 cardholding patient is in decline. It is easier, cheaper [no 329 card 
required], and faster to get supply from the unregulated/illicit market. 
 
Within the dispensary system quality and variety of products continue to increase while prices are 
going down. For example, Big Island Grown’s RSO is available at the everyday low price of $20 per 
gram ensuring the most vulnerable patients in need have access to this therapeutic option, as well as 
$25-$30 quality eighths. Licensing fees have increased [300% for some] while patient numbers 
continue to decline. Currently there are not enough patient sales to support current licensees to even 
grow their own product. At least half of the licensees are [over] producing for the current market at 
partial production capacity. Some licensees are opting to purchase wholesale in lieu of turning on 
rooms due to operational costs and other considerations. There is already an overabundance of 
supply-industry is requesting wholesale language fix to streamline the process. We fear issuing new 
cultivation licenses in this depressed medical market without the demand would be setting up new 
businesses for failure.  
 
Big Island Grown supports a patient’s right to grow their own and their right as a consumer to have access 
to high quality, clean, tested cannabis for whatever therapeutic reason they see fit for themselves. We 
look forward to the day when there is a thriving demand for legal cannabis leading to the expansion of 
viable opportunity within this medical program and beyond.  We believe it would be irresponsible to issue 
additional cultivation licenses to those seeking real opportunity in the legal industry to enter a system that 
does not support its existence…at this time. 
 
We respectfully urge the Committees to pass HB302 with language to allow for immediate access/sales to 
the dispensary system following the Department of Health Registry System recognizing successful 
submission of a complete application, and your thoughtful reconsideration of additional cultivation 
licenses based on the state of the current dispensary system in this declining medical market.  
 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify.

Hawaiʻi Alliance for Cannabis Reform  
In Support of HB302 HD2 SD1  
 
 
 
 
 
April 1, 2025 
 
 
Aloha Chairs Rhoads and Dela Cruz, Vice Chairs Gabbard and Moriwaki, and 
honorable members of the Senate Committees on Judiciary and Ways & Means: 
 
The Hawaiʻi Alliance for Cannabis Reform (HACR) is a coalition of organizations and 
individuals working to end cannabis prohibition in Hawaiʻi and replacing it with a 
system of legalization and regulation, with a focus on reparative justice and inclusion. 
We also support Hawaiʻi’s medical cannabis program and believe it should be expanded 
and improved. Members include the ACLU of Hawaiʻi, Cultivation Sector Consulting 
LLC, Cannabis Society of Hawaiʻi, Chamber of Sustainable Commerce, Doctors for 
Drug Policy Reform, Drug Policy Forum of Hawaiʻi, and Marijuana Policy Project. 
 
We strongly support HB302 HD2 SD1, which would make several improvements to the 
medical cannabis program, including: 
• 
allowing physicians and advanced practice registered nurses to certify patients 
for medical cannabis via telehealth, and 
• 
allowing practitioners to certify patients to use medical cannabis for any medical 
condition. 
 
Both reforms would bring the treatment of medical cannabis closer to prescription 
drugs, which often carry far greater risks.  
 
Supporting Allowing Medical Cannabis Certifications by Telehealth  
Hawaiʻi allows practitioners to issue most prescriptions via telehealth. (See HRS §453-
1.3, §457.27.) The same should be true of medical cannabis. 
 
During and since the COVID pandemic, telemedicine has become an “indispensable 
resource.”1 Unnecessarily requiring in-person visits can be burdensome and can expose 
vulnerable patients to pathogens. It can also prevent patients from consulting with the 
practitioner of their choice. Many physicians are not trained in medical cannabis and 
the most knowledgeable medical cannabis practitioners may be on a different island.  
 
Hawaiʻi law should not impose unnecessary costs and burdens on medical cannabis 
patients that are not imposed on other medications. It should allow telemedicine for 
medical cannabis.

future. Connect Health. 2022 Jan 4;1:7-35. doi: 10.20517/ch.2021.03. PMID: 35233563; PMCID: PMC7612439. 

 
Allowing Medical Cannabis for Any Medical Condition   
We are grateful that the Senate Health and Human Services Committee and Consumer 
Protection Committees amended HB302 HD2 SD1, to allow physicians and advanced 
practice nurses to certify patients with “any condition [the practitioner] determined to 
be appropriate for the medical use of cannabis.” 
 
This amendment, which HACR and others requested, is consistent with the trust placed 
in practitioners for other medications. One-fifth of all prescriptions are “off-label,” or are 
for a medical condition other than the one the FDA approved the medication for.2 
 
Many prescriptions carry far more serious risks than medical cannabis. Each year, well 
over 100,000 Americans die from adverse drug events.3 Meanwhile, cannabis has not 
been shown to have any lethal dose in humans.4 
 
States are increasingly allowing physicians to use their discretion to certify patients to 
use cannabis, which is in many cases a safer alternative to prescriptions. At least 10 
other states allow physicians to recommend medical cannabis for any condition or any 
serious condition — California, Delaware, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, 
Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, and Virginia.  
 
There are over 10,000 rare diseases,5 and many more that have not even been 
identified. It is impossible to have research for any medication on all of the conditions 
any one drug may assist. Research is far more limited for cannabis because the federal 
government stacked the deck against research into cannabis’ benefits due to unique 
federal barriers and the lack of funding.6 
 
The FDA and HHS have recommended rescheduling cannabis to Schedule III because it 
has currently accepted medical use and a lower potential for abuse than Schedule II 
drugs.7 It remains to be seen if the Trump Administration’s DEA will follow through on 
this scientific recommendation. But in the meantime, Hawaiʻi should expand its own 
law to allow practitioners to certify patients for any condition — essentially allowing 
medical cannabis “off-label.”

Doctors, nurse practitioners, and their patients should be trusted to evaluate risks and 
benefits of medical cannabis, as they can with other medications.  
 
Opposing the New Class C Felony 
 
While we strongly support the provisions listed above, we do not support the new Class 
C felony for operating a dispensary without a license. 
 
Effective Date  
 
The current effective date is 2050. We urge your committees to add an effective date 
within six months, so that the House may choose to concur without requiring a 
committee of conference. 
 
Concluding Thoughts  
 
HB302 HD2 SD1 would make it easier for Hawaiʻi residents who could benefit from 
medical cannabis to consult with a knowledgeable provider, qualify for and enroll in the 
state’s medical cannabis program, and purchase lab-tested medicine.  
 
We urge you to pass HB302 HD2 SD1 out of your committees.

Comments:  
Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki, & WAM Committee Members: 
Chair Rhoads, Vice Chair Gabbard, & JDC Committee Members: 
On behalf of Drug Policy Forum of Hawaiʻi (DPFH), I am writing in support of HB 302, HD 2, 
SD 1, which would repeal the requirement that a provider-patient relationship be established in 
person for the purpose of certification as a medical cannabis patient and  authorize providers 
greater latitude in patient certification. 
The creation of a new cannabis cultivator license has the potential to diversify the strains of dried 
flower available to patients and create additional employment opportunities in every county. 
However, the state Department of Health must endeavor to be less restrictive than they have been 
with the issuance of dispensary licenses and to finally provide tone-neutral science-based public 
educational materials on the benefits and risks of cannabis use. 
These are but a few of many reforms to Hawaiʻi’s medical cannabis regulations that would better 
meet the needs of current patients and other residents who could benefit from its use. For 
example, medical cannabis patients should be provided with statutory employment protections. 
Medical cannabis patients who are terminally ill should be able to access non-smokable forms of 
cannabis in hospice care or skilled nursing facilities akin to Ryan's Law in California. 
DPFH strongly opposes the creation of new state felonies in the context medical cannabis (or 
manufactured hemp products that are arguably legal under federal law). At this point in 
time more funding should instead be dedicated to onboarding greater numbers of persons into 
participation in the medical cannabis sector.

RE:  
In SUPPORT of and Proposing Amendments to HB302 H.D. 2, S.D. 1 Relating to 
Cannabis 
 
Aloha Chairs Dela Cruz and Rhoads, Vice Chairs Moriwaki and Gabbard, and Committee 
Members, 
 
The ACLU of Hawaiʻi supports H.B. 302, H.D. 2, S.D. 1, which repeals the requirement that a 
provider-patient relationship must be established in person and allows practitioners to certify 
patients to use medical cannabis for any medical condition. We also respectfully request 
amendments. 
 
During and since the COVID pandemic, telemedicine has become an “indispensable resource.” 
Unnecessarily requiring in-person visits can be burdensome and can expose vulnerable patients 
to pathogens. It can also prevent patients from consulting with the practitioner of their choice. 
Many physicians are not trained in medical cannabis and the most knowledgeable medical 
cannabis practitioners may be on a different island. 
 
This is particularly true in Hawai‘i, where there is a shortage of doctors and other medical 
practitioners on the neighbor islands. Telemedicine is a powerful and prudent tool that allows 
neighbor island residents to receive medical attention and guidance. Hawai‘i law already allows 
practitioners to write prescriptions via telemedicine. There is no reason the same can’t be done 
for medical cannabis. 
 
Hawai’i law should not impose unnecessary costs and burdens on medical cannabis patients that 
are not imposed on other medications. It should allow telemedicine for medical cannabis. 
 
We are grateful that the Senate Health and Human Services Committee and Consumer Protection 
Committees amended HB302 HD2 SD1, to allow physicians and advanced practice nurses to 
 	

The mission of the ACLU of Hawaiʻi is to protect the fundamental freedoms enshrined in the U.S. and State 
Constitutions. The ACLU of Hawaiʻi fulfills this through legislative, litigation, and public education programs 
statewide. The ACLU of Hawaiʻi is a non-partisan and private non-profit organization founded in 1965 that 
provides its services at no cost to the public and does not accept government funds. 
certify patients with “any condition [the practitioner] determined to be appropriate for the 
medical use of cannabis.”  
 
We believe prescribing physicians and advanced practice registered nurses should be able to 
write medical cannabis prescriptions for “off-label”. Currently, approximately one-fifth of all 
prescriptions written in the U.S. are for “off-label” uses of medications for conditions other than 
what has been approved by the FDA.  
 
More states are allowing medical practitioners to use their discretion to prescribe cannabis to 
their patients. Medical cannabis is often a safer alternative to other prescriptions. 
 
Currently, at least nine states allow medical cannabis prescriptions for any condition or any 
serious or debilitating condition, and we appreciate this bill’s intent to allow Hawai‘i to join that 
list of states, which includes California, Delaware, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, 
Oklahoma, New Hampshire, and Virginia. 
 
Proposed Amendments 
1. Effective Date: The bill’s current effective date is 2050. We ask that your committees 
amend the effective date to within six months of the bill’s passage, so that the House may 
choose to concur without requiring a committee of conference. 
2. Class C Felony: While we strongly support the provisions listed above, we do not 
support the creation of a new Class C felony charge for operating a dispensary without a 
license. We ask that your committees delete this provision. 
 
In conclusion, H.B. 302, H.D. 2, S.D. 1 is a sensible cannabis public policy.  It will make it 
easier for Hawaiʻi residents to benefit from medical cannabis after consultation with a 
knowledgeable provider, qualify for and enroll in the state’s medical cannabis program, and 
purchase lab-tested medicine. 
 
We respectfully request that you pass H.B. 302, H.D. 2, S.D. 1 out of your committees with the 
requested amendments.

Comments:  
To: COMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS and COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY 
Dear Chairs, Dela Cruz and Rhoads, Vice Chairs, Moriwaki and Gabbard and Members of the 
Committees. 
My name is Wendy Gibson-Viviani and I’m a Cannabis Nurse Educator who has been a medical 
cannabis patient advocate for over 10 years. I am a member of the Hawaii Alliance for Cannabis 
Reform and I Co-Chair the Education and Research Committee for the American Cannabis 
Nurses Association.    
I’m writing in SUPPORT Of HB302, HD2 SD1. I believe this bill can improve our medical 
cannabis program by expanding patient access. 
Patients cannot always travel to a provider to get certified to use cannabis.  I know from 
experience. In 2015, I went to California to help my dying father gain access to medical 
cannabis.  He was too weak and in way too much pain to travel – so he could not establish a 
provider-patient relationship in-person. Fortunately, I was able to locate the only physician in 
Northern California who made house-calls. 
Having a Tele-health option would have made our lives a lot easier.  Allowing establishment of 
the provider-patient relationship through Tele-health is an excellent way to expand patient access 
to Hawaii’s program. 
And please, help improve patient access to the medical cannabis program by adding to or 
replacing the list of qualifying conditions. The certifying doctors and nurses should decide which 
patients should be certified.  Let them practice medicine. 
Our program’s list of qualifying conditions covers many prevalent chronic and debilitating 
conditions, however, there are many patients who could potentially benefit from use who don’t 
have a condition on that list.  For example, while we do have ALS on our list, cannabis clinicians 
have reported repeated successes when treating patients with other neurologic conditions such as 
traumatic brain injuries, Autism Spectrum Disorders, Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease.  And, 
as you may know, some patients are using it in post stroke recovery.   

Also missing from the list are conditions that a large percentage of patients report using cannabis 
to treat: anxiety, depression and sleep disorders.   
Please vote “yes” to improving patient access to Hawaii’s medical cannabis program by 
promoting HB302 HD2 SD1. Thank you for the opportunity to share my thoughts.

To: Chair Dela Cruz and Rhodes,Vice-Chairs Moriwaki and Gabbard and respected Senators of 
the WAM and JDC Committees  
From: Robert Lawrence Bence, 8th generation Kula farmer and member of the Hawai’i State 
Hemp Task Force  
RE: Comments on and Amendments to HB302, HD2, SD1 Recommend Changes to help 
patients, caregivers and farmers. 
Date: 3/30/2025 
Aloha Chairs Dela Cruz and Rhodes,Vice-Chairs Moriwaki and Gabbard and respected 
Senators of the WAM and JDC Committees  
I’m a severely disabled 329 patient, cannabis has saved several times. I support medical 
cannabis for all; however, this bill currently includes language that could destroy the medical 
cannabis program that has been working for 25 years. This bill is far superior than SB1429 
which included huge fines.  
The dispensaries are trying to commercialize the medical cannabis program in an effort to get 
more customers; however, the vast majority of patients like myself would never shop at the 
overpriced low quality federally illegal dispensaries that are against patients rights to grow the 
medicine that keeps us alive. 
If going to water down the 329 program to allow non debilitating conditions offer the following 
amendment: Section 2 return the strikeout language covering the current debilitating 
conditions and classify these patients as tier 1 patients. The new language begins with 
the underlined “any condition determined by the certifying physician or advanced 
practice registered nurse to be appropriate for the medical use of cannabis." should be 
classified as tier 2 Hawai’i state 329 patients.  
The tier 1 patients should be given future opportunities to sell directly to other patients under a 
federally regulated cannabis law that has already passed and other state benefits to be 
developed in future legislation. Distinguishing the patients that need cannabis to survive and 
the new tier 2 patients, that do not require cannabis to survive, will also help to ensure the 
current patients aren’t impacted by the potential abuse by potential non medicinal users.  
Recommend Removing The provision mentioning hemp: “ "Waiting room" includes an 
area where hemp can be sold, including but not limited to hemp products and accessories to 
the use of medical cannabis, such as rolling papers, rolling trays, grinders, and vaporizers."” 
should be struck out. As hemp is federally legal and cannabis is federally illegal, unless 
approved for federal research, which would cause potential regulatory issues from the USDA 
who has said that state dispensaries are not allowed to obtain federal hemp licenses.  
The sale of cannabis should not be limited as limited licenses have proven to be a failure 
in every state. The dispensaries are only shopped at by tourists and transplants so limiting 
sales to the 8 state sponsored for-profit oligarchy system. This will not serve the purpose of 
helping boost the enrollment of the 329 program unless patients aren’t allowed to sell directly 
to other patients. The adult farmers market model has proven to be successful and should be 
included as an allowable sales venue.  
Remove section 3 as it is already illegal to run an unlicensed dispensary.  

Mahalo
