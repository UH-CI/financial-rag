  "overview": "This measure now focuses exclusively on improving patient access to medical cannabis. It repeals the requirement for an in-person consultation to establish a provider-patient relationship, allowing for certification via telehealth. The bill also permits applicants to make a temporary, one-time purchase of a limited amount of medical cannabis after submitting their certification form but before receiving their official registration card.",
  "appropriations": "The current version of the bill contains no appropriations. The previous provision that appropriated an unspecified amount from the Medical Cannabis Registry and Regulation Special Fund to the Department of the Attorney General for enforcement has been removed.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal analysis is now based on the understanding that the proposed changes are primarily administrative and procedural. It is assumed that the Department of Health can facilitate the temporary purchase authorization using its existing registration system and resources. No significant costs are anticipated, as testified by the relevant agencies.",
  "agency_impact": "The operational impact on state agencies is significantly reduced. The Department of Health will experience a minor administrative workload increase to facilitate the temporary purchase authorization for new applicants. The Department of the Attorney General's previously anticipated role in expanded enforcement is no longer included in this measure.",
  "economic_impact": "The expected economic impact is now focused on patient retention within the regulated medical cannabis system. By reducing administrative barriers such as the in-person visit requirement and registration delays, the measure aims to prevent patients from turning to the illicit market. This may help stabilize the patient base for licensed dispensaries but does not involve the broader market restructuring proposed previously.",
  "policy_impact": "This measure's policy changes are now limited to patient access and telehealth modernization. It removes the distinction between medical cannabis and other medical services for the purpose of establishing a patient relationship via telehealth. The bill no longer addresses the broader market structure, such as creating new license types or enhancing criminal penalties.",
  "revenue_sources": "This measure is no longer expected to generate new state revenue. The provisions that would have established a new cannabis cultivator license and associated fees have been removed from the bill. All activities will be managed within existing funding structures.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The six-year fiscal outlook for this measure is negligible. Unlike the previous version, this bill does not create new programs, licenses, or enforcement mandates that would require startup or recurring expenditures. Any administrative adjustments required by the Department of Health to implement the temporary purchase authorization are expected to be absorbed within its existing operational budget over the six-year period, with no need for additional staffing or appropriations.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "There is no anticipated impact on operating revenues resulting from this measure. The bill does not introduce any new fees, fines, or other revenue-generating mechanisms. The previous projection of increased revenue from new cultivator license fees is no longer applicable.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "There are no anticipated fiscal implications after the initial six-year period. The administrative changes are not expected to create new, ongoing fiscal obligations for the state. The measure does not establish any permanent new programs or positions that would require funding beyond the six-year outlook.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The bill's focus has fundamentally changed, resulting in a significantly different fiscal impact. Key changes include the removal of provisions establishing a new cannabis cultivator license, authorizing inter-dispensary sales, and creating new criminal penalties for unlicensed operators. Consequently, the appropriation to the Department of the Attorney General for enforcement has been eliminated, and the previously projected new revenue stream from license fees no longer exists. The bill's fiscal impact is now considered negligible, as it is limited to minor administrative adjustments for patient access rather than a broad expansion of regulatory and enforcement activities."
