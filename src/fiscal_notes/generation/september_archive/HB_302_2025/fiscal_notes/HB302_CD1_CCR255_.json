{
  "overview": "The purpose has been expanded to include new provisions such as Department of Health authority to inspect patient medical records and a broader definition for a \"qualifying patient.\" The timeline for key components has been significantly altered: the implementation of criminal penalties for unlicensed operations is accelerated to July 1, 2025, while the new cannabis cultivator license requirement is further delayed to January 1, 2028. These changes create a bifurcated implementation schedule, prioritizing immediate enforcement against the illicit market while allowing more time for regulatory development of the new cultivation framework.",
  "appropriations": "This measure specifies an appropriation from the Medical Cannabis Registry and Regulation Special Fund to the Department of the Attorney General of $750,000 for fiscal year 2025-2026 and another $750,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027. These funds are designated to establish and hire six new full-time equivalent positions to support the drug nuisance abatement unit. The positions consist of four Investigator V, one Investigator IV, and one Analyst.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal projections are revised based on a further one-year delay in the cannabis cultivator license program, now scheduled to begin on January 1, 2028. It is assumed that costs and revenues associated with this program will not materialize until fiscal year 2028, pushing the fiscal impact further into the future. The methodology now accounts for the immediate fiscal impact of accelerated criminal enforcement, with costs for the Attorney General's new positions beginning in fiscal year 2026.",
  "agency_impact": "The scope of the Department of the Attorney General's Drug Nuisance Abatement Unit is explicitly broadened to include enforcement against illegal cannabis and hemp products, supported by a specific appropriation for six new positions. The Department of Health is granted new authority to inspect patient medical records, introducing a new administrative workload. The implementation timeline for the Department of Health to establish the cultivator license program is extended by another year to January 1, 2028, further deferring the major operational impact.",
  "economic_impact": "The anticipated economic effects from the new cultivator license class are now postponed until 2028. Conversely, the accelerated enforcement against unlicensed dispensaries, effective July 1, 2025, may more immediately disrupt the illicit market and potentially redirect consumer spending to licensed dispensaries. The authorization for licensed dispensaries to sell hemp products and accessories could also create a new, modest revenue stream for these legal businesses.",
  "policy_impact": "This measure adjusts the state's cannabis policy by accelerating enforcement while simultaneously delaying market expansion. The start date for criminal penalties against unlicensed dispensaries is moved up to July 1, 2025, signaling a more immediate focus on curbing the illicit market. In contrast, the postponement of the new cultivator license program to January 1, 2028, provides an even longer runway for the Department of Health to develop the necessary regulatory framework.",
  "revenue_sources": "The timeline for collecting new revenues from cannabis cultivator license fees is postponed by an additional year, with collections now anticipated to begin in calendar year 2028. This further delays a key source of funding intended to make the regulatory program self-sustaining. The specified appropriation of $1.5 million over two fiscal years will draw down the existing balance of the Medical Cannabis Registry and Regulation Special Fund to cover immediate enforcement costs.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The fiscal outlook is reshaped by diverging timelines for enforcement and regulation. The appropriation of $750,000 per year for FY26 and FY27 creates an immediate and defined cost for the Department of the Attorney General's enforcement activities, funding six new positions. This upfront expenditure will be drawn from the special fund. Conversely, the postponement of the cultivator license program to January 1, 2028, pushes all associated recurring costs for the Department of Health and related license fee revenues outside of the typical six-year window. The fiscal implications are now front-loaded with enforcement costs for the first two years, while the significant costs and revenues of the market restructuring are deferred to FY28 and beyond. This creates a potential strain on the special fund in the near term, as expenditures will precede the new revenue intended to support them.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The projected increase in state operating revenues from the collection of cultivator license fees is now delayed until on or after January 1, 2028. This pushes the new revenue stream well into the future, delaying the point at which the expanded regulatory program becomes self-funded. No other significant changes to operating revenue are anticipated.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The long-term fiscal obligations are now pushed further into the future, with the recurring costs for the Department of Health to regulate the new cultivator license program not expected to begin until fiscal year 2028. The sustainability of the program will depend on the sufficiency of license fee revenues collected after this date to cover ongoing costs for both departments. The appropriation for the Attorney General's positions is only for two years, implying a need for a continued funding mechanism in subsequent years.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The implementation timeline has been substantially revised: the new cannabis cultivator license program is now delayed an additional year to January 1, 2028. Conversely, the effective date for establishing criminal penalties for unlicensed dispensaries has been significantly accelerated from 2027 to July 1, 2025. A specific appropriation of $750,000 per year for FY26 and FY27 has been detailed, funding six new enforcement positions within the Department of the Attorney General, whose nuisance abatement authority is also explicitly expanded to cover illegal hemp products."
