{
  "overview": "The measure has been amended to refine its enforcement provisions and delay the implementation of its market-restructuring components. The Class C felony for operating an unlicensed dispensary now requires a specific state of mind (intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly), and a new, distinct misdemeanor offense has been created for platforms that advertise illicit cannabis sales. Most significantly, the effective date for the new cannabis cultivator license program has been postponed to January 1, 2027, delaying its fiscal and economic impacts.",
  "appropriations": "The expending authority for the appropriation from the Medical Cannabis Registry and Regulation Special Fund has been clarified. The funds designated for enforcement and nuisance abatement activities will now be expended directly by the Attorney General, rather than by the Director of Health. This change aligns the funding authority with the agency responsible for the enforcement actions.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal timeline has been significantly adjusted due to the delayed implementation of the cultivator license program. It is now assumed that the costs and revenues associated with this new license class will not begin until fiscal year 2027. The methodology now accounts for a longer preparatory period for the Department of Health to conduct rule-making and establish the necessary regulatory infrastructure.",
  "agency_impact": "The role of the Department of the Attorney General is further specified, clarifying that its Drug Nuisance Abatement Unit will enforce nuisances under chapter 329D and that the Attorney General will directly expend the appropriated funds for this purpose. The implementation timeline for the Department of Health is extended, delaying the full operational impact of managing the new cultivator license program until 2027. This provides the department with additional time for program development.",
  "economic_impact": "The anticipated economic impacts from the creation of a new cultivator license class are now deferred. The delayed implementation until January 1, 2027, means that any restructuring of the market supply chain, changes in product availability, or shifts in consumer spending from the illicit to the regulated market will not occur in the near term. The introduction of a misdemeanor penalty for advertising illicit sales may have a minor deterrent effect on the unregulated market.",
  "policy_impact": "The measure's enforcement policy is now more nuanced, creating a two-tiered approach with a felony for unlicensed operations and a lesser misdemeanor for advertising those operations. A major policy shift is the postponement of the cultivator license program until January 1, 2027, formally recognizing the need for a longer implementation period for rule-making and system development. This addresses concerns raised by the Department of Health regarding the need for adequate preparation.",
  "revenue_sources": "While the funding sources remain the same, the timing of new revenues has changed. The collection of fees from the new cannabis cultivator licenses, which will supplement the Medical Cannabis Registry and Regulation Special Fund, is now postponed until the program begins in 2027. Revenue from potential fines associated with the new misdemeanor offense for illicit advertising may provide a minor, additional source of income.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The six-year outlook is substantially altered by the postponement of the cultivator license program to January 1, 2027. While enforcement costs for the Department of the Attorney General in FY26 and FY27 remain, the significant recurring costs for the Department of Health's regulatory activities and the corresponding revenue from license fees are now pushed to the second half of the six-year window. This creates a more gradual fiscal ramp-up, with initial years focused on enforcement and later years incorporating the new licensing framework. The newly established misdemeanor penalty for advertising illicit sales introduces a potential for minor, but likely unpredictable, revenue from fines during this period.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The expected increase in state operating revenues from the collection of new cannabis cultivator license fees is now delayed. The Department of Health will not begin collecting these application and renewal fees until the program is implemented on or after January 1, 2027. This pushes the new revenue stream to later fiscal years.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The long-term fiscal obligations for the state remain, but their commencement is deferred. The permanent, recurring annual costs for the Department of Health to regulate the cultivator license program and for the Department of the Attorney General to continue enforcement activities will begin later than previously anticipated. The sustainability of these functions will still depend on revenues from licensing fees deposited into the Medical Cannabis Registry and Regulation Special Fund once the program is fully operational.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "Key changes from the previous version of the bill include a significant delay in the implementation of the new cannabis cultivator license program until January 1, 2027. The enforcement framework has been refined, adding a specific intent requirement ('intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly') to the Class C felony for unlicensed operations and creating a new, separate misdemeanor offense for platforms that advertise illicit sales. Additionally, the authority to expend the appropriation for enforcement has been officially transferred from the Department of Health to the Attorney General."
