  "overview": "This measure has been amended to narrow its focus solely to telehealth access for medical cannabis certification. The key change from the previous version is the deletion of the provision that would have allowed applicants to make a temporary, one-time purchase of cannabis before receiving their official registration card. The bill now only repeals the requirement for an in-person consultation and adds a new requirement that certifications must originate from within the State.",
  "appropriations": "",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal analysis is now based on the removal of the temporary purchase provision, which eliminates the minor administrative workload previously anticipated for the Department of Health. It is now assumed that repealing the in-person consultation requirement has no direct fiscal impact on the state. The measure is considered to have a negligible fiscal effect as it only modifies a procedural requirement for patient certification.",
  "agency_impact": "The anticipated operational impact on the Department of Health has been eliminated. With the removal of the temporary purchase authorization, there is no longer an expected increase in administrative workload. The measure is not expected to have any budgetary or operational impact on any state agency.",
  "economic_impact": "The bill's potential economic impact is now limited to the effects of allowing telehealth for initial patient certifications. While this may still help retain some patients in the regulated medical cannabis system by improving access for those with mobility issues or in remote locations, the removal of the temporary purchase provision means the bill no longer addresses the economic friction caused by registration delays. The primary economic effect is now solely related to improved provider accessibility.",
  "policy_impact": "This measure's policy implications have been narrowed to modernizing patient access through telehealth. By deleting the temporary purchase provision, the bill no longer attempts to address the policy issue of patient access delays during the registration process. The primary policy change is now solely focused on aligning the provider-patient relationship requirements for medical cannabis with those for other medical services that permit telehealth.",
  "revenue_sources": "",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The six-year fiscal outlook is now considered to have no fiscal impact, an update from the previously projected negligible impact. The removal of the provision allowing temporary purchases eliminates the minor administrative costs that the Department of Health was expected to absorb. As the bill is now a purely procedural change regarding telehealth, it is not anticipated to create any direct state expenditures or require any staffing changes over the six-year period.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The most significant change from the previous version of the bill is the complete removal of the provision that would have allowed patients to make a one-time cannabis purchase after submitting their application but before receiving their official registration card. This amendment was made in response to concerns raised by the Department of Health and the Department of the Attorney General regarding potential legal liability and logistical challenges. Consequently, the bill's anticipated administrative impact on the Department of Health has been eliminated, and its fiscal impact is now considered to be zero rather than negligible."
