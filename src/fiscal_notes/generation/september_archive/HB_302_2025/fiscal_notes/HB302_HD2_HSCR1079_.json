  "overview": "While this measure's primary purpose remains to repeal the in-person consultation requirement for medical cannabis certification, new testimony reveals a significant push from industry stakeholders to re-insert a previously deleted provision. This amendment would allow patients a temporary, one-time purchase of cannabis upon submitting their application, aiming to reduce access delays. This re-introduces a key component that had been removed in a prior draft.",
  "appropriations": "",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The previous assumption of zero fiscal impact is now challenged by proposed amendments to re-introduce a temporary purchase provision. Should this amendment be adopted, the fiscal impact would shift from zero back to negligible, as the Department of Health would need to absorb minor administrative costs to facilitate and track these temporary authorizations. This analysis is based on industry testimony proposing specific language for this new process.",
  "agency_impact": "The prior assessment of no agency impact is now contingent upon potential amendments. If the temporary purchase provision is re-instated, the Department of Health's Office of Medical Cannabis Control and Regulation would face a new, minor operational workload. This involves facilitating temporary authorizations and verifying applicant submissions against the state's registry system before a permanent card is issued.",
  "economic_impact": "New testimony highlights a 15% decline in registered patients over the last three years, which is attributed to regulatory barriers and competition from the illicit market. The economic discussion now includes the argument that re-instating a temporary purchase provision could help retain patients in the regulated system by immediately addressing their needs. This is presented as a measure to counteract patient attrition and support the viability of licensed dispensaries.",
  "policy_impact": "The policy debate has expanded beyond simply aligning telehealth standards with other medical practices. Proposed amendments aim to re-engage the issue of patient access delays during the registration period, a problem the previous version of the bill had ceased to address. Adopting the temporary purchase provision would represent a policy shift to actively reduce barriers to entry into the medical cannabis program.",
  "revenue_sources": "",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The six-year outlook changes from no fiscal impact to a sustained, negligible fiscal impact if the bill is amended as requested. The re-introduction of a temporary purchase authorization would create a recurring, low-level administrative cost for the Department of Health. This new function would require staff time to verify and facilitate temporary access for all new applicants annually. While not expected to require new positions, it represents an ongoing operational workload to be absorbed within the department's existing budget. The IT systems for the patient registry would also require modification and maintenance to accommodate this temporary status. These costs, though minor, would persist throughout the six-year period, directly contradicting the previous zero-impact forecast.",

  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The most significant update is the coordinated effort by the cannabis industry to re-insert the temporary purchase provision that was removed from the previous version of the bill. This proposed amendment, modified to a 25% purchase limit, would reverse the findings of the last fiscal note, changing the bill's fiscal impact from zero back to negligible due to the re-introduction of an administrative workload for the Department of Health. Additionally, new testimony has introduced other policy considerations not previously discussed, such as using AI for instantaneous registration approval."
