  "overview": "This measure now makes the Women's Court Pilot Program in the First Circuit permanent by codifying it into the Hawaii Revised Statutes. It also establishes a two-year Women's Court Pilot Program in the Kona division of the Third Circuit, which will sunset on June 30, 2027. The previous requirement for the Judiciary to report on the costs of expanding the program to other circuits has been deleted.",
  "appropriations": "The bill reverses the previous unspecified appropriation, now allocating specific funding for the Kona pilot program: $514,900 for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027. These funds are designated for mental health and substance abuse treatment services, equipment, and the creation of one full-time equivalent temporary probation supervisor position. The previously considered funding for the Department of Health is no longer included.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal analysis is now based on a defined two-year pilot program with specified appropriations, rather than a three-year proposal with uncertain funding. The cost model no longer includes the Department of Health's staffing needs, as the Judiciary is now responsible for providing mental health services. The total allocated budget for the two-year pilot is $1,071,900.",
  "agency_impact": "The operational impact on the Department of Health has been eliminated, as the Judiciary is now mandated to provide mental health services for the Kona pilot. Consequently, the Judiciary's operational responsibilities have increased, requiring it to manage these services and establish one new temporary full-time equivalent probation supervisor position. The permanent establishment of the First Circuit program will incorporate its functions into the Judiciary's baseline operations.",
  "economic_impact": "",
  "policy_impact": "The measure now codifies the Women's Court Program in the First Circuit, elevating it from a pilot to a permanent program within the Hawaii Revised Statutes. This change establishes the program as a lasting component of the state's judicial framework. Additionally, the deletion of the reporting requirement for expansion into other circuits focuses current state policy on the implementation and evaluation of the Kona pilot.",
  "revenue_sources": "The program is funded by a direct legislative appropriation from the State of Hawaii. The specific amounts for fiscal years 2026 and 2027 are explicitly provided for in the measure. No other sources of revenue are identified.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The fiscal outlook is now defined by a two-year funded pilot, replacing the previous three-year projection with uncertain funding. For fiscal year 2025-2026, $514,900 is appropriated for the Kona pilot, establishing a temporary 1.0 FTE probation supervisor position and covering services and equipment. For fiscal year 2026-2027, $557,000 is appropriated to continue these operations. The Kona pilot program and its associated funding and temporary position will terminate on June 30, 2027, resulting in no expenditures for this pilot in fiscal year 2027-2028 or beyond. The First Circuit program is now permanent, and its ongoing costs will be absorbed into the Judiciary's base budget. There are no further fiscal implications from this measure for the remainder of the six-year period.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The previous uncertainty regarding funding for equipment has been resolved. The specific appropriations for fiscal years 2026 and 2027 now explicitly include funding for equipment for the Kona pilot program. This ensures that the necessary capital expenditures are covered within the allocated budget.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The Kona pilot program will have no ongoing fiscal obligations after its sunset date of June 30, 2027, unless reauthorized by subsequent legislation. However, the Women's Court Program in the First Circuit is now permanent, meaning its operational costs will become a recurring annual expense within the Judiciary's base budget indefinitely. The specific annual cost for the permanent program will depend on future Judiciary budget allocations.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "Appropriations are now specified at $514,900 for FY26 and $557,000 for FY27, replacing the previous unspecified amounts. Responsibility for mental health services has been transferred from the Department of Health to the Judiciary, removing the DOH's anticipated fiscal impact. The Kona pilot program's duration has been reduced from three years to a two-year pilot, sunsetting on June 30, 2027, and the First Circuit program has been made permanent."
