  "overview": "This measure now makes the Women's Court pilot program in the First Circuit permanent. It establishes a new, temporary three-year pilot program specifically in the Kona division of the Third Circuit, operating under the supervision of the Big Island Drug Court. The measure appropriates funds for the Kona pilot and requires the Judiciary to report to the Legislature on the need and costs for future expansion to other circuits.",
  "appropriations": "The appropriation has been changed to a specific amount directed to the Judiciary for the new Kona pilot program: $514,900 for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027. This funding is designated for various contracted services and two temporary positions (a Probation Supervisor and a Peer Specialist). All previously discussed appropriations for the Department of Health and for pilots in the Second and Fifth circuits have been removed.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The cost estimation methodology has shifted entirely from the Department of Health's staffing model to a detailed two-year budget proposal submitted by the Judiciary for the Kona pilot. This new methodology is based on the necessity of funding direct services due to the lack of community-based providers in West Hawai'i. Projections are based on itemized costs for contracted mental health professionals, behavioral health beds, cultural practitioners, Moral Reconation Therapy, and technology.",
  "agency_impact": "The operational impact is now focused solely on the Third Circuit Judiciary, which will establish and manage the Kona Women's Court pilot program as a new division under the Big Island Drug Court. This includes direct oversight of contracted service providers and management of a new Probation Supervisor position. The previously anticipated impact on the Second and Fifth Circuits is eliminated, and the Third Circuit's role has changed from conducting a study to implementing a full pilot program.",
  "economic_impact": "",
  "policy_impact": "This measure now codifies the Judiciary's position that specialty courts require models tailored to neighbor island needs, establishing the Kona pilot under the existing Drug Court structure. A significant policy change is making the First Circuit's Mohala Wahine program permanent, transitioning it from a pilot to an established component of the justice system. The bill also formalizes future policy considerations by requiring a report on the feasibility of expanding the program to the Second, Fifth, and Hilo circuits.",
  "revenue_sources": "The specified appropriations for the Judiciary's pilot program will be funded from the State's general fund.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The fiscal outlook now centers on a two-year appropriation for the Third Circuit (Kona) pilot, totaling $1,071,900 over fiscal years 2026 and 2027 to fund contracted services and two temporary positions. Although the bill establishes a three-year pilot, funding is only provided for two years, indicating a need for an additional appropriation in fiscal year 2028 to complete the third year. A new, permanent fiscal obligation is created by making the First Circuit program permanent, which will now be an ongoing cost in the Judiciary's base budget. The sunset provision of June 30, 2028, now applies only to the Third Circuit pilot program.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The measure now includes a minor capital expenditure of $4,900 in the first year for the Kona pilot program. These funds are allocated for technology, including computer workstations for staff and client use, a laptop for fieldwork, a printer, and a cellphone.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The primary long-term fiscal change is the permanent establishment of the First Circuit's Women's Court, which creates an ongoing annual operating cost for the state. If the Kona pilot is made permanent, it would require sustained annual funding of at least $557,000 (adjusted for inflation) to support its direct-service model. Any future expansion to other circuits would likely require a similar, significant, and sustained financial commitment to directly fund clinical services where community resources are scarce.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The focus of the bill has fundamentally shifted from establishing pilot programs in the Second and Fifth Circuits to creating a single, tailored pilot in the Third Circuit's Kona division. Specific appropriations of $514,900 for FY26 and $557,000 for FY27 have been inserted for the Judiciary, while the Department of Health's requested funding has been entirely removed. The most significant update is that the First Circuit's Women's Court program has been made permanent, establishing it as an ongoing state responsibility and cost. The financial basis for the new pilot is no longer a generic staffing model but a detailed budget from the Judiciary designed to fund direct clinical and support services."
