  "overview": "This measure makes the Women's Court Pilot Program in the First Circuit a permanent program. It also establishes a new, three-year Women's Court Pilot Program in the Kona division of the Third Circuit under the supervision of the Big Island Drug Court to address the distinct needs of women in the criminal justice system. The measure further requires the Judiciary to submit a report on the need and costs associated with expanding the pilot program to the Second and Fifth Circuits.",
  "appropriations": "The measure appropriates $514,900 for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027 to the Judiciary. These funds are designated for services and the establishment of two temporary positions for the new Women's Court Pilot Program in the Kona division of the Third Circuit. An earlier provision to appropriate an unspecified amount to the Department of Health was deleted.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal projections are based on the operational success and participant data of the existing Mohala Wahine pilot program in the First Circuit, which has been active since January 2023. Cost estimates for the new Third Circuit pilot were informed by Judiciary testimony regarding the resources needed to address the specific challenges in the Kona area, such as high poverty and limited social services. The appropriations for services and two temporary positions are assumed to be the necessary costs to launch and operate the program for its first two years.",
  "agency_impact": "The Judiciary is the primary agency impacted, as it will be responsible for institutionalizing the First Circuit program as permanent and launching the new three-year pilot program in the Third Circuit. This includes hiring and supervising two temporary positions, managing the program's budget, and providing gender-responsive, trauma-informed services. The Judiciary must also conduct a study and report to the Legislature on the feasibility of future expansion to other circuits.",
  "economic_impact": "The measure is expected to generate long-term economic benefits by reducing recidivism, which in turn lowers costs associated with incarceration and law enforcement. By providing participants with substance abuse treatment, mental health support, and other services, the program aims to improve employment opportunities and reduce reliance on other social services. This initiative enhances community safety and supports the well-being of participants and their families.",
  "policy_impact": "This measure amends state policy by converting a successful pilot program in the First Circuit into a permanent one, cementing the use of gender-responsive specialty courts. It expands this policy approach by establishing a new pilot in the Third Circuit, shifting from the originally proposed Second and Fifth Circuits. The legislation reinforces a broader strategy of implementing evidence-based, trauma-informed care within the state's criminal justice system.",
  "revenue_sources": "The program is funded through direct appropriations from the state legislature. The bill specifies appropriations totaling $1,071,900 over two fiscal years for the new pilot program in the Third Circuit. No other revenue sources, such as federal grants, fees, or private donations, are mentioned in the document.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The six-year fiscal implication includes making the First Circuit program permanent, which will have ongoing annual costs not specified in this document. For the new three-year pilot in the Third Circuit, the specified costs are $514,900 for FY 2026 and $557,000 for FY 2027. The cost for the third year of the pilot, FY 2028, is not specified but is expected to be similar to or greater than the FY 2027 appropriation. These funds support services and two temporary positions. After the third year, the pilot would require new legislation and funding to continue. The required report on expanding the program to the Second and Fifth Circuits could lead to significant additional appropriations in later years if those expansions are approved. Therefore, costs will be concentrated in the Judiciary's budget for at least three years for the pilot, with permanent, recurring costs for the First Circuit program.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "This measure is not anticipated to have any impact on the state's operating revenues. The program is designed as a service-providing entity funded entirely by legislative appropriations. It does not include provisions for collecting fees, fines, or other forms of revenue.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "There are no capital expenditures identified in this measure. The appropriations are explicitly for services and two temporary positions, which are operating costs. The bill does not authorize or fund the construction of new facilities, major equipment purchases, or significant technology infrastructure investments.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "After six years, the Women's Court in the First Circuit will have permanent, ongoing annual operating costs that will need to be included in the Judiciary's base budget. The three-year pilot program in the Third Circuit will have concluded, and if deemed successful, it would require new legislative action and sustained annual funding of over $557,000 to become permanent. Depending on the report findings, there may be additional fiscal pressure to expand the program to other circuits, leading to further long-term financial commitments.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "No previous fiscal note was provided for comparison. This fiscal analysis is based solely on the text of H.B. No. 727, H.D. 1, S.D. 1."
