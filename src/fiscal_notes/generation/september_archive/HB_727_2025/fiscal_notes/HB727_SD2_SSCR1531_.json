  "overview": "",
  "appropriations": "All specific appropriations for the Judiciary have been amended to unspecified amounts to facilitate further discussion. The Department of Health's request for $221,788 to fund a 1.0 FTE Clinical Psychologist and a 1.0 FTE Social Worker to support the pilot has been noted by the committee and is now a consideration. This reverses the previous version's removal of Department of Health funding.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The cost basis remains the Judiciary's detailed three-year budget proposal, now clarified to total $1,576,900 ($514,900 in FY26, $547,000 in FY27, and $515,000 in FY28). Additionally, a new cost component has been introduced based on the Department of Health's staffing model, which requests $221,788 annually for screening and assessment personnel. The legislative action, however, has shifted from specific funding to an unspecified appropriation, making these figures targets for future budget negotiations.",
  "agency_impact": "The measure now introduces a significant operational and budgetary impact on the Department of Health, which would be responsible for providing forensic screenings and assessments for the Kona pilot. This would require the hiring of a new 1.0 FTE Clinical Psychologist and a 1.0 FTE Social Worker/Human Services Professional. This impact on the Department of Health was not present in the prior version of the fiscal note.",

  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The Judiciary's full three-year cost projection for the Kona pilot is now identified as $1,576,900 ($514,900 in year one, $547,000 in year two, and $515,000 in year three), providing a more complete figure than the previously noted two-year funding plan. However, with the appropriation now unspecified, there is no guaranteed funding, creating uncertainty for all three years of the pilot. Furthermore, a new potential recurring cost of $221,788 annually for the Department of Health has been added to the fiscal outlook for the duration of the pilot.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "While the request for a $4,900 capital expenditure for technology in the first year remains, the specific appropriation to fund this has been removed and changed to an unspecified amount. The funding for this expenditure is no longer guaranteed and is subject to future budget negotiations.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The most significant change is that specific appropriations for the Judiciary have been amended to unspecified amounts, making funding for the pilot program contingent on future discussions. Concurrently, the Department of Health's request for $221,788 in annual funding and two new positions has been reintroduced as a key consideration, reversing its previous elimination from the bill. The Judiciary's testimony also clarified the full three-year cost of the Kona pilot at over $1.5 million, providing a complete financial picture that was previously based on a two-year funding cycle."
