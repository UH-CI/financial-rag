  "overview": "",
  "appropriations": "The Department of Health has specified that its funding request of $801,802 is intended to fund three temporary positions for each new pilot circuit. These positions include a 1.0 FTE Clinical Psychologist, a 1.0 FTE Social Worker, and a 1.0 FTE Social Services Assistant. This staffing model is based on the operational requirements of the existing First Circuit program.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The financial projections for the Department of Health's participation are now based on a specific, itemized cost model from the First Circuit's Mohala Wahine program. This model calculates costs based on three dedicated staff positions per circuit: a Clinical Psychologist at $145,000, a Social Worker at $76,788, and a Social Services Assistant at $45,216. These figures are used as the basis for estimating the costs for the new pilot programs.",
  "agency_impact": "The Judiciary has testified that the pilot program as proposed may not be successful on neighbor islands due to unique geography and a lack of community mental health services. It proposes an alternative model where a pilot in the Third Circuit would be operated as a division of the existing Big Island Drug Court, leveraging its structure to serve both Hilo and Kona. This testimony indicates that direct hiring of mental health providers by the Judiciary may be necessary for the program's success.",
  "economic_impact": "Testimony from community stakeholders and the Public Defender suggests the program will generate positive economic impacts by reducing recidivism and diverting women from incarceration, which is more costly. By providing gender-responsive, trauma-informed services, the program aims to help participants successfully reintegrate into the community. The success of the First Circuit's Mohala Wahine program is cited as evidence of these potential benefits.",
  "policy_impact": "The Judiciaryâ€™s testimony introduces a significant policy consideration that a 'one-size-fits-all' approach may be ineffective for neighbor islands. It highlights the need for implementation models that are flexible and tailored to the specific geographical challenges and resource limitations of each circuit. This suggests that future expansions of specialty courts will require circuit-specific planning rather than simple replication of the First Circuit's model.",
  "revenue_sources": "",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The three-year fiscal outlook is now more specific due to the Department of Health's (DOH) detailed budget request. The DOH anticipates requiring $267,004 annually per pilot circuit to fund a Clinical Psychologist, a Social Worker, and a Social Services Assistant. For the two pilot programs established in the Second and Fifth Circuits, this equates to an annual DOH cost of $534,008, totaling approximately $1.6 million over the three-year pilot period. The Judiciary will require a separate, currently unspecified appropriation for its own staff and operational costs to manage the two pilot courts. The DOH has requested a total of $801,802, an amount sufficient for three circuits, while the bill only establishes two, indicating a potential discrepancy between funding requested and programs established. The pilot program and all associated positions and funding are temporary and scheduled to sunset on June 30, 2028. Therefore, there are no programmed fiscal implications beyond this date without further legislative action. Recurring expenses will primarily be personnel costs for both the Judiciary and DOH. Projections do not assume program expansion within the three-year timeframe.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "Future fiscal obligations after the pilot period, should the program be expanded, may be significantly higher for neighbor islands than for the First Circuit. Testimony from the Judiciary indicates a severe lack of community-based mental health providers, suggesting the State may need to directly fund and hire clinical service providers. This would represent a shift from funding program coordination to funding direct treatment, establishing a more substantial and sustained long-term financial commitment.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "This fiscal note update incorporates specific budgetary and implementation details not present in the previous version. The Department of Health's appropriation request is now broken down by specific positions and costs per circuit, providing a clearer basis for financial projections. The Judiciary's testimony introduces significant new information regarding the operational challenges on neighbor islands and proposes an alternative implementation model, highlighting that a 'one-size-fits-all' approach is unworkable. Finally, new testimony provides a basis for assessing the program's potential economic impact through reduced recidivism and clarifies that long-term costs on neighbor islands may be higher due to the need for state-funded direct clinical services."
