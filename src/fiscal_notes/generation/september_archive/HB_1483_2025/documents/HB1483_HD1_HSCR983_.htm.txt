RE:
H.B. No. 1483
H.D.
1
Honorable Nadine K. Nakamura
Speaker, House of Representatives
Thirty-Third State Legislature
Regular Session of 2025
State of Hawaii
Madame:
Your Committee on
Finance, to which was referred H.B. No. 1483, H.D. 1, entitled:
"A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO FIREWORKS,"
begs leave to report as follows:
The
purpose of this measure is to:
(1)
Establish an
adjudication system and procedures to process fireworks infractions;
(2)
Amend and establish
various definitions and penalties for fireworks offenses, including
establishing heightened penalties under certain circumstances;
(3)
Establish various
criminal offenses and penalties related to fireworks or articles pyrotechnics;
and
(4)
Appropriate funds to
the Judiciary to implement this measure.
Your Committee received testimony in support of this measure
from the Department of Law Enforcement; Honolulu Police Department; Hawaiian
Humane Society; and four individuals.
Your
Committee received testimony in opposition to this measure from the Office of
the Public Defender; Libertarian Party of Hawaii; and two individuals.
Your Committee received comments on this
measure from the Department of the Attorney General; Phantom Fireworks; TNT
Fireworks; and Hawaii Explosives & Pyrotechnics, Inc.
Your Committee
notes the suggested amendments from the Department of the Attorney General in
its written testimony to clarify that those holding fireworks permits or
licenses may continue to use their permits or licenses and to clarify which law
enforcement officers may be designated as administrative inspectors.
Your Committee further notes the concerns of
the Office of the Public Defender regarding the concurrent trial provision in
this measure and the office's assertion that it is the lack of enforcement,
rather than the lack or severity of penalties, that has resulted in the low
number of charges brought under existing fireworks control laws.
As affirmed by the
record of votes of the members of your Committee on Finance that is attached to
this report, your Committee is in accord with the intent and purpose of H.B.
No. 1483, H.D. 1, and recommends that it pass Third Reading.
Respectfully
submitted on behalf of the members of the Committee on Finance,
