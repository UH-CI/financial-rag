Chair Tarnas, Vice Chair Poepoe, and members of the Committee: 
 
The Department of Law Enforcement (DLE) supports House Bill 1483. 
The establishment of an adjudication system and procedures to process fireworks 
infractions represents a significant step forward in addressing the ongoing challenges of 
illegal fireworks in Hawaii. This bill provides a more robust framework for enforcement 
and accountability. 
 
The proposed heightened penalties for fireworks offenses, particularly in cases resulting 
in substantial bodily injury, serious bodily injury, or death, are critical deterrents that 
appropriately reflect the serious nature of these violations. These enhanced penalties 
will serve as a stronger deterrent and help protect our communities from the dangerous 
consequences of illegal fireworks use. 
 
The DLE is concerned in one area of HB 1483 pertaining to the potential repeal of 
certain provisions in Section 17 of this bill that relate to the DLE’s ability to assist the fire 
departments with conducting inspections of fireworks licenses.

Last year, the Legislature acted to give the DLE authority to assist the county fire 
departments with inspections of fireworks licenses.  DLE sought that authority as a way 
of aiding the county fire departments and ensuring that the distribution system for legal 
fireworks in the state remains closed; except for those who hold valid licenses.  The 
DLE believes that this authority is still needed and recommends that it remain in statute.   
 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify in support of this bill.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

TESTIMONY OF 
THE DEPARTMENT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 
 
 
ON THE FOLLOWING MEASURE: 
H.B. NO. 1483, RELATING TO FIREWORKS. 
 
BEFORE THE: 
HOUSE COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY & HAWAIIAN AFFAIRS 
 
DATE:

Chair Tarnas and Members of the Committee:
The Department of the Attorney General (Department) strongly supports this bill 
and offers the following comments and suggested amendments. 
The purpose of this bill is to facilitate more effective enforcement of Hawaii’s 
fireworks control laws, by: (1) amending definitions to reflect more common-sense 
standards; (2) strengthening and clarifying existing criminal offenses; (3) establishing 
new offenses; (4) establishing heightened penalties for repeat offenders and offenses 
that result in substantial or serious bodily injury or death; and (5) establishing non-
criminal fireworks infractions for the lowest-level offenses. 
Criminal statutes serve as a deterrent to illegal activity when they are effectively 
enforced and prosecuted.  For many years, however, Hawaii’s state laws regarding illicit 
fireworks have made it difficult for state and county agencies to enforce or prosecute 
these types of cases.  When asked, prosecutors have repeatedly cited challenges 
posed by "gathering evidence and meeting the high burden of proof necessary for 
convictions",1 as well as "stringent definitions [in statute, that] . . . routinely create 
roadblocks to effective prosecution."2  Thus, only a small number of criminal fireworks

cases have been initiated by law enforcement, and an even smaller number have been 
prosecuted, resulting in a largely “ineffective deterrent” to the distribution and use of 
illicit fireworks. 
This bill would largely address the concerns raised by prosecutors, and provide 
greater clarity and efficiency for law enforcement, prosecutors, and the courts that 
handle these cases.  
The Department proposes the following amendments to strengthen the legislative 
intent of the bill.  We recommend adding another offense to section 132D-A, "General 
fireworks or articles pyrotechnic prohibitions in the second degree" that would prohibit 
throwing, catapulting, or otherwise manually propelling ignited fireworks or articles 
pyrotechnic, when those acts do not meet the specific circumstances listed under 
section 132D-5(a)(1), HRS "General fireworks or articles pyrotechnic prohibitions in the 
first degree," as amended at page 47, lines 3-8.  To do this, we recommend 
reorganizing section 132D-A(a) to read as follows: 
(a)  A person commits the offense of general fireworks or articles 
pyrotechnic  prohibitions in the second degree if the person intentionally, 
knowingly, or recklessly [sets]: 
(1)  Sets off, ignites, discharges, or otherwise causes to explode 
any aerial devices, display fireworks, or articles pyrotechnic: 
[(1)] (A)  Within one thousand feet of any operating hospital, 
licensed convalescent home, licensed home for the 
elderly, zoo, licensed animal shelter, or licensed animal 
hospital; 
[(2)] (B)  In any school building, or on any school grounds or 
yards without first obtaining authorization from appropriate 
school officials; 
[(3)] (C)  On any highway, alley, street, sidewalk, other public 
way, or public beach; 
[(4)] (D)  In any park or officially designated forest or wildlife 
preserve; 
[(5)] (E)  Within fifty feet of a canefield; 
[(6)] (F)  Within one thousand feet of any building used for 
public worship during the periods when services are held; 
or 
[(7)] (G)  Within five hundred feet of any dwelling[.]; or 
(2)  Throws, catapults, or otherwise manually propels ignited 
consumer fireworks, aerial devices, display fireworks, or 
articles pyrotechnic. 

Testimony of the Department of the Attorney General 
Thirty-Third Legislature, 2025 
Page 3 of 4 
 
References to the renumbered offenses made in subsection (b) would need to be 
renumbered, accordingly. 
We recommend clarifying the issue of strict liability.  Looking again at "General 
fireworks or articles pyrotechnic prohibitions in the second degree," it appears section 
132D-A(b) (page 31, line 13, to page 32, line 2) intends to establish strict liability for a 
defendant’s knowledge that the defendant was within a designated distance from places 
for which a distance is specified, for purposes of this offense.  If that is the intent, the 
Department recommends amending page 31, line 14, to say: "subsection (a)(1), [(3), 
(4),] (a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(7) shall not be . . . ". 
Further, for clarity, the Department recommends the following changes. 
On page 42, line 1, replace the phrase, ""Aerial devices" includes . . . " with the 
phrase, "Alternatively, "aerial device" may include but is not limited to any device . . . " 
On page 43, line 2, replace the phrase, ""Consumer fireworks" [shall 
comply] includes any firework that . . . " with the phrase, "Alternatively, "consumer 
fireworks" may include but is not limited to any firework that . . . " 
On page 43, lines 8-9, replace the phrase, ""Consumer fireworks" [include] 
further includes firework items . . . " with the phrase, ""Consumer fireworks" may include 
but need not be limited to firework items . . . " 
On page 45, lines 5-6, the Department recommends the following changes 
(underscoring removed from new material in bill, to Ramseyer additional changes): 
 . . . including but not limited to aerial devices, consumer fireworks, or 
display fireworks[.] as defined by this section.  "Fireworks" also includes 
but is not limited to aerial devices . . . 
 
Finally, for penalties in which the level of offense depends on the weight of illicit 
fireworks or articles pyrotechnic, the Department recommends stating a minimum 
weight for each level but not stating a maximum weight to prevent issues of having to 
prove that the amount (of the thing in question) is indeed "less than" the maximum 
amount stated in statute.  To address this concern, the Department recommends 
deleting the phrase, "but less than twenty-five pounds" from section 132D-B(c), HRS, on 
page 34, line 10.

In section 132D-14(a)(2)(B), on page 58, line 20, to page 59, line 1, amend the 
wording there to state (changes highlighted): " . . . is [more than] twenty-five pounds [or 
more,] [but less than fifty pounds,] shall be guilty of a . . . " 
In section 132D-14(a)(2)(C), on page 59, lines 5-6, amend the wording there to 
state(changes highlighted): " . . . is [less than twenty-five pounds,] [more than] five 
pounds [but less than twenty-five pounds,] or more, shall be . . ."

The HPD supports House Bill No. 1483, Relating to Fireworks
The HPD suppofts this bill, which seeks to clarify the definitions of fireworks and
improve enforcement.
The HPD also believes that better enforcement of the fireworks control laws is
essential not only to safeguard property from preventable fire damage but also to
protect the community from injuries related to fires and explosions, respiratory issues
caused by air pollution, and ongoing trauma experienced by individuals due to loud
explosions.
The HPD urges you to support House Bill No. 1483, Relating to Fireworks.
Thank you for the opportunity to testify

RE: 
 Testimony in support of HB 1483: Relating to Fireworks 
 
Thursday, Feb. 6, 2025, 2 p.m., Room 325 & Videoconference 
 
 
On behalf of the Hawaiian Humane Society, thank you for considering our support for 
House Bill 1483, which establishes an adjudication system and procedures to process 
fireworks infractions; amends multiple definitions and penalties for fireworks offenses, 
including heightened penalties if another person suffers substantial bodily injury, 
serious bodily injury, or death as a result of the fireworks offenses; establishes various 
criminal offenses and penalties related to fireworks or articles pyrotechnics; and 
appropriates funds.  
Hawaiian Humane supports any attempt to restrict fireworks from residential 
neighborhoods. Despite tragic deaths and injuries spanning many years - and reaching 
a new level of horror on Oʻahu this year - the crime of using illegal fireworks is rarely 
punished. This comprehensive measure aims to increase enforcement against 
fireworks infractions by creating a new system of adjudication and new penalties to 
address the current failures of our legal system. 
These bombs increasingly go off without regard to date and terrorize pets and people 
alike. The unpredictable barrage makes it impossible to prepare and creates sustained 
stress, which can do lasting damage to emotional, mental and physical health.  
Please pass HB1483 and hold the perpetrators of these crimes accountable. Mahalo for 
your consideration.

TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION TO HB1483 AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN 
Hearing Date: February 6, 2025​
Committee on Judiciary & Hawaiian Affairs 
Aloha Chair Tarnas, Vice Chair Poepoe, and Members of the Committee, 
My name is Joshua Duhaylonsod, and I am writing on behalf of Hawaii Pyrotechnics and 
Explosives LLC (HiPyro),Hawaii’s only professional, licensed fireworks company. For over 30 
years, HiPyro has produced safe, family-friendly productions for all to enjoy—from weekly 
Friday night Outrigger Hotel fireworks to Fourth of July celebrations. It has been our joy to 
help kamaʻāina and visitors create unforgettable memories. 
As a small, locally owned business, HB1483, as written, would severely impact our ability 
to operate. I strongly urge the committee to amend HB1483 to ensure that professional, 
licensed fireworks companies are properly categorized and allowed to continue 
operating legally. 
1. Amend Section 132D-6 to Include “Professional Licensed Fireworks 
Productions” 
Currently, Section 132D-6 provides exceptions only for fireworks used in movies, television, 
and theatrical productions. However, this excludes professional, licensed fireworks 
companies like HiPyro, which operate under strict state and federal regulations and provide 
safe, permitted fireworks displays for private events, community celebrations, corporate 
functions, and public performances. 
To ensure clarity, I respectfully request that “Professional Licensed Fireworks Productions” 
be explicitly added to Section 132D-6 as an exempt category, allowing us to continue providing 
regulated fireworks displays without unnecessary restrictions. 
2. Ensure 132D-6 Defined Entities Can Continue Flying Pyrotechnics with 
Planes 
As written, Section 132D-B could unintentionally prohibit 132D-6 defined entities (including 
professional licensed fireworks productions) from conducting permitted pyrotechnic 
effects via aircraft. This practice is already highly regulated and requires strict federal and 
state permitting to ensure safety and compliance. 
To prevent unintended restrictions, I request that entities covered under Section 132D-6 be 
explicitly allowed to continue conducting permitted pyrotechnic effects via aircraft, as 
already regulated under existing laws. This ensures that legal, professionally managed 
pyrotechnic operations can continue without disruption. 
 LATE *Testimony submitted late may not be considered by the Committee for decision making purposes. 

Conclusion 
While I support reasonable regulations to ensure public safety, HB1483, as written, does not 
account for the essential role of professional, licensed fireworks companies and their 
ability to conduct permitted pyrotechnic effects via aircraft. Without these amendments, 
this bill will unintentionally restrict legally permitted operations, impacting businesses, 
community events, and large-scale productions in Hawaii. 
I respectfully urge the committee to amend HB1483 to: 
●​ Add “Professional Licensed Fireworks Productions” to Section 132D-6 
●​ Ensure entities covered under Section 132D-6 can continue conducting permitted 
pyrotechnic effects via aircraft under existing regulations 
Mahalo for your time and consideration. I am happy to answer any questions and provide further 
insight into Hawaii’s professional fireworks and pyrotechnics industry.

Hawaii Representatives & Senators: 
 
On behalf of the Libertarian Party of Hawaii, I am writing to express our strong opposition to any 
prohibitions and enforcement measures targeting fireworks. We believe Hawaiians have the 
right to pursue and engage in any activities that bring them joy and fulfillment. 
 
Fireworks prohibitions and regulations infringe upon the freedom of our citizens to partake in 
this time-honored custom, diminishing the spirit of celebration and unity that fireworks bring. 
 
Implementing strict enforcement measures to crack down on fireworks usage would only serve 
to burden law enforcement resources, and divert needed attention away from more pressing 
issues. Prohibitions and heavy enforcement will lead to unnecessary conflict between police and 
citizens, eroding trust and creating an atmosphere of fear and animosity. Causing harm against 
another person is already illegal, and crimes can already be prosecuted without these new 
tyrannical enforcement measures.  
 
The Libertarian Party of Hawaii stands firm in our support of individual freedom and opposes 
any measures that encroach upon our citizens' rights.  
 
In Freedom,

Hopefully, this will be another efficient tool in the toolbox to punish those who commit 
fireworks infractions. Enough is enough already, with people and pets killed, injured, houses 
burned, and emergency responders overtaxed. It is time to stop talking and start acting. The 
excuse that fireworks are cultural does not cut it any longer. He harm greatly outweighs culture. 
All fireworks should be provided by licensed organizations.

I am one who loves New Years Eve and played with the firecrackers.  My father served with 
HFD and we did it carefully. 
For the past many years, however, there have been way too many aerials and bombs going off at 
all times of the year. 
When innocent children are hurt of killed, the illegal use and aquisition of the fireworks must be 
stopped. These irresponsible adults must be dealt with, severely. 
Please support this bill and make it work

Honorable Chair, Vice Chair, and Members of the Committee, 
I write in strong OPPOSITION to HB1483, which expands the adjudication system for fireworks 
infractions, increases penalties, and criminalizes additional aspects of fireworks use. This bill 
represents yet another unnecessary expansion of government power, infringing upon personal 
freedoms and disproportionately punishing individuals for victimless acts. 
The use of fireworks, especially for cultural and celebratory purposes, is a long-standing 
tradition in Hawai'i. This bill would escalate penalties and create new criminal offenses, further 
entangling peaceful individuals in the criminal justice system. Government should not be in the 
business of micromanaging personal behavior when there is no direct harm to others. Instead of 
criminalizing more activities, lawmakers should focus on reducing unnecessary government 
interference in the lives of Hawaiians. Many law-abiding residents use fireworks responsibly to 
celebrate these traditions. Expanding law enforcement’s role in policing these activities 
criminalizes peaceful celebrations and sets a dangerous precedent for further government 
overreach in private affairs. 
The creation of an adjudication system and additional criminal offenses will inevitably require 
more law enforcement resources. This opens the door to increased surveillance, invasive 
searches, and more aggressive policing tactics—all for the "crime" of possessing or using 
fireworks. Instead of prioritizing real public safety threats, this bill diverts resources to 
enforcing regulations against individuals where there is not necessarily harm to person or 
property. This is an inefficient and heavy-handed approach. 
This bill proposes an indefinite appropriation of taxpayer money to establish and maintain a 
new enforcement division, adding salaries, equipment, and operational expenses to an already 
bloated state budget. The cost of maintaining this unit will only grow over time, diverting critical 
resources away from more pressing public concerns, including: Hawai‘i’s housing crisis, 
rising cost of living, failing infrastructure, and violent crime and property crime. 
At a time when residents are struggling to afford basic necessities, it is fiscally irresponsible to 
dedicate large sums of money to further criminalizing an activity that is, in most cases, a 
victimless crime. The enforcement of fireworks bans disproportionately impacts working-class 
families who may not have access to expensive, government-sanctioned fireworks events. 

The bill proposes heightened penalties if another person is injured or killed as a result of 
fireworks use. However, existing laws already provide sufficient recourse for cases where harm 
occurs due to recklessness or negligence. Adding more penalties under the guise of public safety 
is merely punitive, not preventative. The state should not increase criminal penalties based on 
hypotheticals when civil remedies already exist. 
Creating a permanent fireworks enforcement division sets a dangerous precedent. Historically, 
when the government expands enforcement powers, it rarely scales them back—even when the 
policies prove ineffective. This bill risks: 
• 
Selective enforcement, where certain communities are disproportionately targeted. 
• 
Increased fines and penalties, adding financial burdens on working families. 
• 
Unnecessary confrontations between citizens and law enforcement, leading to further 
tensions in the community. 
Hawai‘i already has some of the strictest fireworks regulations in the country, yet illegal 
fireworks persist. Further enforcement crackdowns will not stop the underground market; rather, 
they will drive up demand for illicit sales, much like prohibition-era policies have done in other 
contexts (e.g., the War on Drugs). 
Instead of heavy-handed enforcement measures, the Legislature should consider alternative 
solutions that respect individual liberty while addressing legitimate concerns such as fire hazards 
and noise complaints. These could include: 
• 
Designated community fireworks zones where individuals can legally celebrate in a safe 
environment. 
• 
Public education and fire safety campaigns rather than increased criminal penalties. 
• 
Decriminalization of consumer-grade fireworks, allowing responsible individuals to 
purchase and use them legally while maintaining safety regulations on large commercial 
explosives. 
This bill is a classic example of big government overreach that restricts personal freedoms 
while doing little to improve public safety. The Legislature should reject this unnecessary 
expansion of the criminal code and instead seek solutions that respect individual rights while 
encouraging responsible use of fireworks. 
Thank you for your time and consideration. 
Sincerely, 
Nicholas Zehr

Aloha Chair Tarnas, Vice Chair Poepoe, and Committee Members, 
I STRONGLY SUPPORT HB1483. 
After a slight decrease in illegal fireworks in 2023, thanks to the Illegal Fireworks Task Force 
making several large seizures at the docks, there was a significant increase in 2024. It has been 
noted that current laws are weak, does not provide deterrence, are difficult to enforce and 
virtually almost impossible to prosecute. Having individuals take videos, risking retaliation, 
assaults, and getting injured from fireworks, have proved useless because once fireworks 
explodes there is no evidence, and many are not willing to testify. It was identified that one of 
the main roadblocks to enforce and prosecute illegal fireworks was the way these type of 
fireworks were defined.  
HB1483 provides an excellent solution by providing clear definitions and implementing a 
dedicated adjudication system for fireworks infractions similar to traffic infractions. This will 
make it easier for officers to increase enforcement of end-use violators and make it easier and 
faster to adjudicate cases in a district or family court.  An exorbitant amount is spent on 
fireworks, so hopefully fines will be hefty enough and escalate as needed until a point of 
deterrence is achieved.  
In the area where I live, aerials were most prominent this past New Year’s Eve. These aerials 
come not from a nearby neighbor, but from a street or two over. What I found most disturbing is 
the use of more plastics. When these tubes explode parts of it shatters, scattering small sharp 
pieces of plastic in the grass. The goal is to reduce plastics but aerials that have no useful 
purpose scatter it everywhere. Restaurants and consumers, diligently purchase reusable bags, 
environmentally friendly containers and utensils while aerials are allowed to continue  polluting 
the environment. It takes patience each year cleaning up debris that we had nothing to do with. 
It’s troubling for people who have to pay for damages caused by illegal fireworks because there 
is no evidence and proof who did it.  A post this past New Year’s Eve showed a gaping hole in a 
Waipahu roof where debris landed on furniture and the floor. We cringe when we hear  an aerial 
hit our roof. My neighbor has a nice garden and plants vegetables to eat. This past New Year’s 
Eve she actually covered what she could of her garden so firework chemicals and debris would 
not contaminate her plants and soil. 

You would think the Aliamanu incident would make people think twice, but I still hear illegal 
fireworks every now and then, not to mention another recent incident on 1/28/25 where a 27 
year-old woman sustained serious multiple shrapnel injuries after igniting fireworks. 
Please pass HB1483 to prevent another Aliamanu tragedy. 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify.

To the Honorable Committee, 
I am writing in support of HB1483.   
There needs to be better enforcement against fireworks infractions and a new system of 
adjudication, with new penalties.  
We have all seen and know the horror and damage fireworks can cause....  
Stronger penalties and more enforcement is paramount.  
Thank you for your cosnideration. 
Sincerely, 
Taurie Kinoshita 
lifelong voter and resident!

My name is Bill Dixon, and I live with my wife in Kaneohe. We believe it’s time to demilitarize 
our neighborhoods, eliminate deadly impacts on children and families, and protect our islands 
from fires by banning most fireworks and increasing penalties for the use of illegal fireworks. 
HB1483 Relating to Fireworks will clamp down on illegal fireworks in multiple ways, including: 
Consolidating the adjudication process for fireworks offenses. 
Increasing penalties for those whose illegal fireworks injure or kill others. 
Making it a crime to send fireworks on airplanes and to remove the explosive materials from 
fireworks. 
Establishing penalties for storing illegal fireworks at a residence. 
Allowing citizens to bring nuisance complaints against properties used to commit fireworks 
related offenses. 
This bill makes it possible to appropriately punish those who flout the law and put the people and 
environment of our community at risk. I urge the committee to endorse and advance the bill.

I strongly support the passage of HB 1483 "Relating to Fireworks" this session.  The bill 
establishes various criminal offenses and penalties related to illegal fireworks.   
Long term disability and death of our residents are not acceptable for using illegal fireworks 
without bearing the consequences of those actions. 
Thank you for the opportunity to provide written testimony in strong support of HB 1483.
