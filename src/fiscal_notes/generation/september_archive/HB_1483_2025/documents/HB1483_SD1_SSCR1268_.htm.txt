Sir:
Your Committees on
Public Safety and Military Affairs and Judiciary, to which was referred H.B.
No. 1483, H.D. 1, entitled:
"A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO FIREWORKS,"
beg leave to report as follows:
The
purpose and intent of this measure is to:

Your Committees
received testimony in opposition to this measure from the Office of the Public

received comments on this measure from Phantom Fireworks and TNT Fireworks.
Your Committees
find that there is an urgent need for a more structured approach to fireworks
enforcement in the State.
This measure
will address critical weaknesses in the current regulatory framework by
establishing a dedicated adjudication system that will streamline the
processing of fireworks infractions, allowing for more efficient enforcement
and prosecution.
This measure will also establish
a graduated penalty structure that appropriately reflects the severity of
violations, particularly those resulting in serious injury or death, which
serves as both a deterrent and an appropriate response to the harm caused.
