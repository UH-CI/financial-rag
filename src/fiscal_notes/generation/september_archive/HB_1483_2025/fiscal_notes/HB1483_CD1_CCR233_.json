  "overview": "",
  "appropriations": "The final conference draft of the measure removes the previously included appropriation of funds. As a result, no state funds are allocated for implementation, and county police departments and the Judiciary will be required to absorb any new costs within their existing budgets. This contrasts with the earlier version of the bill, which had included an unspecified amount of funding for these purposes.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The financial projections now incorporate revenue from a new $20 administrative fee for each fireworks infraction, which will be deposited into the judiciary computer system special fund. This methodology assumes the new fee will partially offset the increased administrative costs for the Judiciary resulting from processing a higher volume of infractions. The core assumption that non-criminal infractions will allow for more efficient enforcement remains.",
  "agency_impact": "The Judiciary is now tasked with collecting a new $20 administrative fee for each fireworks infraction that results in a judgment for the State. This creates a new administrative duty to manage and deposit these funds into the judiciary computer system special fund. While this provides a dedicated revenue stream, it also adds to the Judiciary's administrative workload.",
  "economic_impact": "The measure was amended to remove the fifty-permit annual limit for permits related to aerial devices, articles pyrotechnic, and display fireworks. This change directly addresses and mitigates the previously identified negative economic impact on the licensed professional fireworks display industry. Commercial pyrotechnic companies will no longer face this operational restriction.",
  "policy_impact": "",
  "revenue_sources": "The general fund appropriation mentioned in the previous analysis has been eliminated. The measure's revenue will now be generated from fines for violations and a newly established $20 administrative fee for each fireworks infraction adjudicated in favor of the State. These administrative fees are specifically designated for the judiciary computer system special fund.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The six-year fiscal outlook is significantly altered by the removal of the state appropriation, placing the full financial burden of implementation on the counties and the Judiciary. These entities must now absorb all operational costs for enhanced enforcement and adjudication from their base budgets. Although the Judiciary will collect a new $20 administrative fee per infraction for its computer systems fund, this revenue is not expected to cover the total cost of the increased caseload. Consequently, the net fiscal impact is projected as a cost to counties and the Judiciary, likely straining their resources without dedicated state funding.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "In addition to revenue from fines, the measure will now generate new operating revenue for the Judiciary through a $20 administrative fee on each fireworks infraction. This revenue is specifically directed to the judiciary computer system special fund to support technology and administrative costs. This creates a new, dedicated revenue stream that was not part of the previous fiscal analysis.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "Long-term fiscal obligations will fall entirely to the counties and the Judiciary, as the final bill provides no ongoing state funding stream. The sustainability of the enhanced enforcement program will depend on the ability of these entities to continually cover annual operating costs from their own base budgets. This represents a significant shift from the potential for state support suggested in earlier versions.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The most significant change is the deletion of the monetary appropriation, which now requires counties and the Judiciary to absorb all implementation costs. To mitigate negative economic impacts, an amendment was made to remove the annual fifty-permit limit for the professional fireworks industry. A new $20 administrative fee per infraction has been added, with revenue directed to the judiciary computer system special fund to help offset the Judiciary's administrative expenses."
