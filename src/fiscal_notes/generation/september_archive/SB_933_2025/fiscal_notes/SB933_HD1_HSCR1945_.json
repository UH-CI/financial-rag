  "overview": "Senate Bill 933, now in House Draft 1, continues to serve as a legislative vehicle to provide one-time grants to nonprofit organizations facing federal funding cuts. The purpose remains consistent with the previous version, aiming to ensure the continuity of critical public services for fiscal year 2025-2026. A key amendment has changed the effective date from July 1, 2050, to July 1, 3000, to encourage further discussion.",

  "policy_impact": "The measure's policy implications have evolved, with the effective date being pushed to July 1, 3000, which strongly reinforces its status as a vehicle for further negotiation. Widespread testimony has introduced a significant new policy consideration: expanding grant eligibility beyond health and human services to include other critical sectors like education, arts, culture, and the environment. This reflects a broader understanding of the potential impact of federal funding cuts and has become a central point of discussion for the measure's final form.",

  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The primary update in the House Draft 1 version of the bill is the amendment of the effective date from July 1, 2050, to July 1, 3000, signaling the intent for continued and substantial discussion. While the bill's structure remains largely unchanged, extensive testimony from dozens of organizations has strongly urged for an expansion of grant eligibility to include nonprofits in sectors such as education, arts, culture, and the environment, which was not a focus in the previous draft. The House Committee on Finance acknowledged the testimony but did not incorporate this eligibility expansion into the HD1, limiting its amendments to technical changes and the effective date, leaving the scope of the grants as a key item for future deliberation."
