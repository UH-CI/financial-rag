  "overview": "Senate Bill 933, SD2, the 'Grant Funding Act of 2025,' appropriates unspecified funds for one-time grants for fiscal year 2025-2026 to nonprofit organizations providing critical services in response to a potential federal funding freeze. The measure now includes a separate appropriation to the Judiciary for grants and imposes a reporting requirement on all recipient organizations before the 2026 legislative session. An effective date of July 1, 2050, has been set to allow for further discussion and amendment.",
  "appropriations": "This measure appropriates an unspecified sum for one-time, nonrecurring grants for fiscal year 2025-2026 to organizations impacted by a potential federal funding freeze. A separate, unspecified appropriation is also designated to the Judiciary to provide grants for similar purposes, supporting critical services with an estimated need of $615,000. The funds are intended to ensure the continuation of services in areas such as health, human services, housing, and child care.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal projections are based on the core assumption that federal funding for Hawaii's nonprofit sector is at significant risk of being frozen or reduced, potentially disrupting essential community services. The methodology involves providing one-time state grants as a contingency to bridge this anticipated funding gap, with the grant process governed by Chapter 42F, HRS. Data from various agencies and nonprofit organizations, such as the Judiciary's estimate of $615,000 in at-risk federal funds and sector-wide estimates of hundreds of millions, inform the potential scale of the financial need.",
  "agency_impact": "The measure will have a direct operational impact on the Judiciary, which will be tasked with administering a new grant program for its affected nonprofit partners. The Judiciary has expressed concern that this new responsibility should not supplant its existing budget priorities, indicating a potential need for additional administrative resources. For executive agencies like the Hawaiâ€˜i State Energy Office, the grants would serve as a critical financial backstop, enabling them to continue operations and retain federally funded staff without interruption.",
  "economic_impact": "The measure is expected to have a significant positive economic impact by stabilizing the nonprofit sector, which employs nearly 12% of the state's workforce and prevents widespread layoffs. By providing bridge funding, the state can avert the higher long-term costs associated with increased demand for emergency services, homelessness, and public health crises that would result from service disruptions. The grants will ensure the continuation of critical services for hundreds of thousands of residents, supporting community stability and local economies.",
  "policy_impact": "This measure establishes a state-level policy to mitigate the impacts of federal funding instability on Hawaii's nonprofit sector, representing a strategic effort to preserve the state's social safety net. By creating a specific grant mechanism, it reinforces the partnership between the government and community-based organizations. The SD2 amendments, which include a legislative reporting requirement for grantees and a defective effective date for further discussion, signal that this is an evolving and significant policy response to federal actions.",
  "revenue_sources": "The specific revenue source for the appropriations in this bill is not identified in the provided documents. However, based on standard legislative practice for such appropriations, the grants are expected to be funded from the State's general funds. The measure does not establish any new fees, grants from external sources, or other revenue streams to support this expenditure.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The bill appropriates one-time, nonrecurring grants specifically for fiscal year 2025-2026, limiting its direct fiscal implication to that single year. However, the underlying issue of federal funding instability is not expected to be resolved within one year, creating a strong likelihood of similar funding requests in subsequent fiscal periods. The total federal funding at risk for Hawaii's nonprofit sector is estimated to be between $300 million and $400 million annually, indicating a substantial potential gap that the state may be asked to address. For example, the Judiciary has identified an ongoing need of approximately $615,000 per year for its programs alone. Should the federal funding freeze persist, the state could face sustained pressure to provide bridge funding to prevent the collapse of the social safety net. Therefore, while this measure is a one-time appropriation, it may establish a precedent for future state intervention. The long-term fiscal implication is the potential shift of financial responsibility for these critical services from the federal government to the state. The cost in subsequent years would depend on the extent and duration of federal cuts. No program expansion is outlined in the bill, as its purpose is to maintain existing service levels. The annual cost to sustain these services could be substantial and would likely become a recurring item in future state budget discussions.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "This measure makes an appropriation from state funds and does not include any provisions that would generate, increase, or decrease state operating revenues. It is designed as an expenditure to support nonprofit organizations and is not expected to have any direct impact on the State's revenue streams. Therefore, no operating revenue impact is anticipated.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The grants authorized by this measure are intended for operational continuity and the provision of services, not for capital projects. The legislative documents and testimonies do not indicate that the funds will be used for facilities, infrastructure, or major equipment purchases. Therefore, no capital expenditure impact is anticipated as a result of this bill.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "Beyond the initial six-year period, the primary fiscal implication is the potential for a permanent or long-term shift in funding responsibility for critical social services from the federal government to the State. If federal funding streams do not recover, the State will face an ongoing obligation to either continue providing subsidy grants or accept a significant reduction in the social safety net. The annual cost to maintain these programs would likely become a recurring, and potentially growing, part of the state's base budget, raising long-term questions about the sustainability of relying on general funds.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The measure has evolved significantly from its previous status as a placeholder bill. Key updates include the addition of a new part specifically appropriating funds to the Judiciary to administer grants, addressing a need of approximately $615,000 for its programs. A new legislative reporting requirement has been imposed on all grant recipients to enhance accountability. Furthermore, extensive testimony has quantified the potential fiscal impact of a federal funding freeze, with estimates ranging from hundreds of thousands for specific departments to over $300 million for the state's nonprofit sector as a whole, providing concrete data that was previously absent. Finally, the effective date has been changed to July 1, 2050, confirming the bill's role as a legislative vehicle for continued discussion and negotiation."
