  "overview": "Senate Bill 933, the Grant Funding Act of 2025, aims to provide one-time, nonrecurring grants to nonprofit organizations that deliver critical health and human services. The measure is intended to mitigate the detrimental effects of a federal funding freeze on these organizations, which provide services such as child care, subsidized housing, and homeless services. The bill authorizes appropriations for the fiscal biennium 2025-2027 to be distributed in accordance with chapter 42F, Hawaii Revised Statutes.",
  "appropriations": "The bill appropriates unspecified sums from unspecified means of financing for the fiscal biennium beginning July 1, 2025, and ending June 30, 2027. Although Part II, Section 5 of the bill is designated for program appropriations, the specific amounts, program details, and expending agencies have not been included in the provided text. Therefore, the total funding allocated for grants cannot be determined from the document.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "This fiscal note cannot detail any assumptions or methodology as the bill does not contain specific appropriation amounts or financial projections. The legislation serves as a vehicle for appropriations, but the values required for a fiscal analysis are absent from the document. Consequently, no cost estimation methods or data sources were used or provided.",
  "agency_impact": "The bill will have an administrative impact on the state expending agencies that will be designated to manage and distribute the grants. These agencies will be responsible for overseeing the grant process in compliance with chapter 42F, Hawaii Revised Statutes, which includes executing grant agreements and monitoring recipients. However, without specific grant programs or expending agencies being named, the precise operational and budgetary impact on any single agency cannot be determined.",
  "economic_impact": "The measure is expected to have a stabilizing economic impact on Hawaii's nonprofit health and human services sector by offsetting a federal funding freeze. By providing one-time grants, the bill aims to prevent disruptions to essential community services such as health care, child care, and homeless services. This funding helps ensure the continued operation of these organizations and the employment of their staff, thereby supporting both service recipients and the local economy.",
  "policy_impact": "This bill modifies no existing laws but rather utilizes the existing framework of chapter 42F, Hawaii Revised Statutes, to address a specific, timely issue. The primary policy implication is the use of state funds as a temporary backstop against a reduction in federal funding for critical social services. This establishes a precedent for state intervention to ensure the continuity of services provided by nonprofit partners when federal support is interrupted.",
  "revenue_sources": "The bill does not specify the revenue sources for the grants. Section 4 defines various means of financing (MOF), including general funds (A), special funds (B), and federal funds (N), among others. However, the appropriations section does not designate which of these sources will be used, leaving the funding stream undetermined.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The six-year fiscal implications of this bill are limited and uncertain due to the lack of specific appropriation amounts. The bill appropriates an unknown sum for the fiscal biennium 2025-2027. The grants are explicitly defined as 'one-time nonrecurring,' indicating no planned expenditures for this purpose in fiscal years 2028 through 2031. Therefore, the direct fiscal impact is confined to FY 2026 and FY 2027. However, the underlying issue of a federal funding freeze may persist beyond the two-year period covered by this bill. If the federal funding situation is not resolved, there could be significant pressure on the legislature to provide similar grant funding in subsequent biennia. This could potentially turn a one-time expenditure into a recurring state obligation. Without specific figures, a precise multi-year projection is not possible, but the potential for future funding requests should be noted as a significant long-term risk. The bill does not create or authorize any new positions.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The bill is not anticipated to have any impact on state operating revenues. It is an appropriations bill focused exclusively on expenditures in the form of grants to nonprofit organizations. The measure does not introduce any new taxes, fees, or other sources of revenue for the state.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "This bill is not expected to have any direct impact on state capital expenditures. Although the document contains boilerplate language related to capital improvement projects, its stated purpose is to provide grants for services delivered by nonprofit organizations. The funds are intended to support operations and programs, not state-owned capital assets or construction projects.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "As the grants are designated as 'one-time nonrecurring,' there are no planned fiscal obligations for the state after the initial 2025-2027 biennium. However, should the federal funding freeze that prompted this measure continue, the state may face pressure to provide similar support in the future. This could result in new, currently unplanned fiscal obligations to maintain critical services.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "No previous fiscal note was provided for comparison."
