  "overview": "Senate Bill 933 has been finalized to appropriate $50,140,000 from the general fund for fiscal year 2025-2026 to mitigate the impacts of federal funding cuts on Hawaii's nonprofit organizations. The measure directs the Office of Community Services to award grants with oversight from a newly established legislative evaluation committee. It also authorizes the office to contract with Aloha United Way, Inc., for administrative support in distributing the grant funds.",
  "appropriations": "The bill appropriates a total of $50,140,000 from general revenues for fiscal year 2025-2026. This includes $50,000,000 for grants to nonprofits and $140,000 for the Office of Community Services to establish two temporary full-time positions and purchase office equipment. Additionally, Aloha United Way, Inc., may receive up to $500,000 from the grant appropriation as an administrative fee.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal impact is based directly on the specific appropriation amounts detailed in the bill for grants, personnel, and equipment for fiscal year 2025-2026. It is assumed that the full amount will be expended to address documented federal funding shortfalls experienced by nonprofit service providers. The cost for two temporary positions and equipment is explicitly stated, removing the need for estimation.",
  "agency_impact": "The Department of Labor and Industrial Relations' Office of Community Services (LBR903) will experience a significant, temporary increase in workload. The office is tasked with managing the $50,140,000 appropriation, hiring two temporary staff members, and administering a contract with Aloha United Way. This represents a substantial new program for the office to implement and oversee for one fiscal year.",
  "economic_impact": "The measure is expected to have a positive economic impact by providing financial stability to nonprofit organizations facing federal funding reductions. This infusion of $50,000,000 will help preserve critical health and human services for vulnerable populations, preventing service disruptions. It will also support continued employment within the state's nonprofit sector.",
  "policy_impact": "This act establishes a new, specific process for grant distribution, creating a legislative evaluation committee composed of two senators and two representatives to oversee the selection of grantees. This committee's meetings are explicitly exempted from state open meeting laws under Chapter 92, Hawaii Revised Statutes. The measure also statutorily authorizes a contract with a specific entity, Aloha United Way, Inc., to assist in grant administration.",
  "revenue_sources": "The exclusive funding source for this measure is the State of Hawaii's general revenues. A total of $50,140,000 is appropriated from the general fund for fiscal year 2025-2026. No other revenue sources, such as federal funds, special funds, or fees, are identified to support this program.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The fiscal implication is limited to a one-time expenditure in fiscal year 2025-2026. In that year, the state will expend $50,140,000 from the general fund. This total consists of a $50,000,000 appropriation for grants and a separate $140,000 appropriation for administrative costs, which includes $130,000 for two temporary full-time equivalent (2.0 FTE) positions and $10,000 for equipment. Up to $500,000 of the grant fund may be expended by Aloha United Way, Inc. for administrative fees. As the appropriations and positions are temporary and designated for a single fiscal year, there are no further fiscal impacts anticipated for fiscal years 2027 through 2031. Any unencumbered and unexpended balance from the administrative contract shall be returned to the State's general fund. Continuation of this program beyond fiscal year 2026 would require new legislative action and appropriation.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "This measure is not anticipated to have any impact on the State's operating revenues. It is an expenditure bill that appropriates general funds to support nonprofit services. The bill does not create any new fees, taxes, or other sources of revenue.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The bill includes a minor one-time capital expenditure. There is a specific appropriation of $10,000 for fiscal year 2025-2026 designated for the purchase of office equipment and furniture. This is intended to support the two temporary positions established at the Office of Community Services.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "There are no ongoing fiscal implications anticipated after the initial six-year period. The bill provides a one-time appropriation for fiscal year 2025-2026 and authorizes temporary positions for that year only. Therefore, all fiscal obligations created by this measure are expected to conclude by the end of fiscal year 2026.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "This version of the bill transforms it from a legislative vehicle with a placeholder effective date to a substantive and funded measure. The effective date has been changed to a definitive July 1, 2025, and specific appropriations totaling $50,140,000 for grants and administration have been added. Key new provisions include the establishment of a four-member legislative evaluation committee to oversee grant awards and the authorization for the Office of Community Services to contract with Aloha United Way for administration. The broad eligibility expansion to other sectors that was previously under discussion was not included in this final version."
