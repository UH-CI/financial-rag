Chair Yamashita, Vice Chair Takenouchi, and Members of the Committee, the Hawai‘i State Energy Office (HSEO) supports SB 933, SD2, which appropriates moneys for grants for fiscal year 2025-2026. HSEO employs thirteen federal employees and twenty-one active programs supported by federal funds totaling nearly $140 million awarded since January of 2023 that we have aggressively worked with the Attorney General’s office to safeguard. In that regard, we expect to prevail in ensuring all grant awards to HSEO either approved by Congress by a predetermined formula or under a competitive process remain in place. In the",
