Madame:
Your Committee on
Finance, to which was referred S.B. No. 933, S.D. 2, entitled:
"A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO THE STATE
BUDGET,"
begs leave to report as follows:
The
purpose of this measure is to provide one-time nonrecurring grants to organizations
that provide critical services in the public interest and for the public's
health, safety, and general welfare, in accordance with chapter 42F, Hawaii

Your Committee finds that the federal funding freeze imposed by
the United States Office of Management and Budget may have detrimental effects
on Hawaii's nonprofit sector, which provides critical services in health and
human services.
Without assistance from
the federal government, Hawaii's federally qualified health centers as well as
programs that provide child care, social services, subsidized housing, and
homeless services will see a significant drop in funding.
Therefore, your Committee finds that the funds
appropriated through this measure are necessary to ensure that crucial public
services are maintained for the benefit of the State's residents.
Your Committee has
amended this measure by:
(1)
Changing its effective date to July 1, 3000,
to encourage further discussion; and
(2)
Making technical, nonsubstantive amendments
for the purposes of clarity, consistency, and style.
As affirmed by the
record of votes of the members of your Committee on Finance that is attached to
this report, your Committee is in accord with the intent and purpose of S.B.
No. 933, S.D. 2, as amended herein, and recommends that it pass Second Reading
in the form attached hereto as S.B. No. 933, S.D. 2, H.D. 1, and be placed on
the calendar for Third Reading.
Respectfully
submitted on behalf of the members of the Committee on Finance,
