Honorable Ronald D. Kouchi
President of the Senate

Honorable Nadine K. Nakamura
Speaker, House of Representatives
Thirty-Third State Legislature
Regular Session of 2025
State of Hawaii
Sir and Madam:
Your Committee on
Conference on the disagreeing vote of the Senate to the amendments proposed by
the House of Representatives in S.B. No. 933, S.D. 2, H.D. 1,
entitled:
"A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO THE STATE
BUDGET,"
having met, and after full and free discussion, has agreed
to recommend and does recommend to the respective Houses the final passage of
this bill in an amended form.
The purpose of
this measure is to facilitate funding for services provided by the nonprofit
sector.
Specifically, the
measure:
(1)
Appropriates moneys to award grants for fiscal
year 2025‑2026; and
(2)
Subjects recipient organizations to certain
requirements, including legislative reporting requirements.
Your Committee on Conference recognizes the potentially dire
impact that the federal funding freeze imposed by the United States Office of
Management and Budget may have on numerous nonprofit organizations in the State
that provide critical assistance in health and human services.
Your Committee believes that state
policymakers must take the initiative to avert such an impact by providing
sufficient state funding to make up for any federal funding shortfalls.
Your Committee on Conference has amended this measure by restructuring
its contents and:
(1)
Appropriating $50,000,000 to the Office of
Community Services of the Department of Labor and Industrial Relations for the
award of grants in accordance with substantially all the requirements of
Chapter 42F, Hawaii Revised Statutes, for fiscal year 2025‑2026;
(2)
Establishing an evaluation and selection
committee to oversee the awarding of grants;
(3)
Authorizing the Office of Community Services
to contract the services of Aloha United Way, Inc., to assist with the
administration and distribution of grant awards;
(4)
Appropriating $140,000 to the Office of
Community Services to carry out its responsibilities under this measure; and
(5)
Changing the effective date to July 1, 2025.
As affirmed by the
record of votes of the managers of your Committee on Conference that is
attached to this report, your Committee on Conference is in accord with the
intent and purpose of S.B. No. 933, S.D. 2, H.D. 1, as amended
herein, and recommends that it pass Final Reading in the form attached hereto
as S.B. No. 933, S.D. 2, H.D. 1, C.D. 1.
Respectfully submitted on behalf of the managers:
ON THE PART OF THE HOUSE
ON THE PART OF THE SENATE
