RE:
S.B. No. 933
S.D. 2
Honorable Ronald D. Kouchi
President of the Senate
Thirty-Third State Legislature
Regular Session of 2025
State of Hawaii
Sir:
Your Committee on
Ways and Means, to which was referred S.B. No. 933, S.D. 1, entitled:
"A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO THE STATE
BUDGET,"
begs leave to report as follows:
The
purpose and intent of this measure is to provide one-time nonrecurring grants
to organizations that provide critical services, in accordance with chapter
42F, Hawaii Revised Statutes.
Your Committee
received testimony in support of this measure from the Hawaii State Energy
Office, Hawaii Primary Care Association, The Legal Clinic, Hawaii Youth
Services Network, Hawaii Alliance of Nonprofit Organizations (HANO), Catholic
Charities Hawaii, Parents and Children Together, Hawaii Community Foundation,
Hawaii True Cost Coalition, and three individuals.
Your Committee
received testimony in opposition to this measure from the Kingdom of the
Hawaiian Islands and one individual.
Your Committee
received comments on this measure from the Judiciary and one individual.
Your Committee
recognizes the potentially detrimental effects that the federal funding freeze
imposed by the United States Office of Management and Budget may have on
Hawaii's nonprofit sector, which provides critical services for health and
human services.
Your Committee believes
that this measure is an appropriate mechanism to ensure adequate funding for
Hawaii's federally qualified health centers and other programs that provide
child care, social services, subsidized housing, and homeless services.
Your Committee has
amended this measure by:
(1)
Inserting new parts into the measure to
appropriate moneys to the Judiciary to provide grants for the purposes of this
Act;
(2)
Imposing certain requirements on recipient organizations,
including a requirement that each organization receiving grant moneys submit a
report to the Legislature no later than twenty days before the convening of the
Regular Session of 2026; and
(3)
Changing the effective date to July 1, 2050,
to facilitate further discussion on the measure.
As affirmed by the
record of votes of the members of your Committee on Ways and Means that is
attached to this report, your Committee is in accord with the intent and
purpose of S.B. No. 933, S.D. 1, as amended herein, and recommends
that it pass Second Reading in the form attached hereto as S.B. No. 933,
S.D. 2, and be placed on the calendar for Third Reading.
Respectfully submitted on behalf
of the members of the Committee on Ways and Means,
