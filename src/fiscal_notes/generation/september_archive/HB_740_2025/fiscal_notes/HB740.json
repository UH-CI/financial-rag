  "overview": "HB740 establishes the Accessory Dwelling Unit Financing and Deed Restriction Program under the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation (HHFDC). The program aims to increase housing for local workers by allocating funds from the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund (DURF) to counties. Counties will then provide grants to homeowners to finance ADU construction and purchase perpetual deed restrictions, ensuring these units are occupied by qualified residents who work in Hawaii.",
  "appropriations": "This bill does not contain a specific appropriation amount. Instead, it authorizes the HHFDC to allocate an unspecified amount of funds from the existing Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund (DURF) to counties for the program's purposes. The funds are intended for homeowner grants and the county's purchase of deed restrictions.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal impact is based on the assumption that counties will apply for and receive funds from the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund to administer the program. Cost projections are indeterminate as they depend on the number of counties that participate and the volume of applications from eligible homeowners. The methodology involves HHFDC allocating funds from the DURF upon county request, with the overall financial impact tied to program demand.",
  "agency_impact": "The bill will have a significant operational impact on the HHFDC and participating counties. HHFDC will be responsible for program establishment, rulemaking, and managing fund allocations from the DURF. Counties will bear the primary administrative burden of processing applications, disbursing funds, purchasing deed restrictions, and ensuring long-term compliance through annual reporting and potential enforcement actions.",
  "economic_impact": "The program is expected to stimulate residential construction and increase the supply of rental housing for the local workforce. By deed-restricting the properties, the measure aims to ensure these units remain available for residents, potentially moderating rental costs and reducing the number of units used for short-term vacation rentals. This could provide cost savings for local workers seeking housing and contribute to overall community stability.",
  "policy_impact": "This act establishes a new housing policy that uses state funds to incentivize ADU construction while implementing permanent affordability and occupancy controls through deed restrictions. It amends Chapter 201H, HRS, to create the program, expands county powers under Chapter 46, HRS, and alters the authorized uses of the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund. The bill also creates new exemptions to the state conveyance tax, procurement code, and the rule against perpetuities for program participants.",
  "revenue_sources": "The primary funding source for the grants and deed restriction purchases is the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund (DURF). The bill also authorizes HHFDC and the counties to collect administrative fees, creating a secondary revenue stream to offset program costs. A potential tertiary source of revenue is the collection of fifty percent of a property's appreciation upon a non-compliant sale, which would be deposited back into the DURF.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The six-year fiscal impact is indeterminate and dependent on program uptake, but it has the potential to be significant. Assuming an average grant and deed restriction purchase cost of $150,000 per unit and 50 units funded statewide per year, the annual cost from the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund (DURF) would be approximately $7.5 million, totaling $45 million over six years. Administrative costs are also expected for both the HHFDC and participating counties. The HHFDC may require at least one FTE ($80,000 per year including fringe) to manage the program, adopt rules, and process county applications, totaling $480,000 over six years. Each participating county would likely need at least one FTE ($75,000 per year including fringe) to administer the program, monitor compliance for a growing number of units, and handle reporting, potentially costing $450,000 per county over six years. These administrative costs would be recurring and would increase if the program scales up. Therefore, the total estimated impact over six years could exceed $47 million, assuming all four counties participate and demand is consistent.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The bill is expected to have a mixed but likely minor impact on operating revenues. It authorizes HHFDC and counties to collect fees, which could offset some administrative expenses, though the amount is unknown. The state would experience a loss in conveyance tax revenue from the sale of any property with a deed restriction purchased under this program.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "This bill is not expected to have a direct capital expenditure impact on the State or counties. The program provides grants to private homeowners for the construction of accessory dwelling units on their property. These expenditures are private capital investments rather than public works or government facility projects.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The fiscal implications after six years are expected to be ongoing and potentially increasing. The program is established without a sunset clause, implying continued annual allocations from the DURF based on demand. The administrative responsibility on counties to monitor compliance for all deed-restricted properties will be cumulative, likely requiring sustained or increased staffing levels as the number of units in the program grows over time.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "No previous fiscal note was provided for comparison. This is the initial fiscal analysis for this bill."
=======
  "overview": "This measure establishes the Accessory Dwelling Unit Financing and Deed Restriction Program, a pilot initiative designed to increase the state's housing supply. The program allocates funds to counties to provide equity purchase assistance to homeowners for constructing accessory dwelling units (ADUs), subject to a deed restriction. The program requires a legislative report in 2031 and sunsets on December 31, 2030.",
  "appropriations": "The bill authorizes the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation (HHFDC) to allocate up to $2,000,000 per year from the Rental Housing Revolving Fund for the program. These funds are intended to finance an equity purchase program for ADU construction costs and associated expenses. The counties are also authorized to use an unspecified percentage of the awarded funds for their administrative costs.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The financial projection is based on a fixed annual appropriation cap of $2,000,000, rather than a detailed demand analysis. This cap suggests a pilot approach to gauge the program's effectiveness before committing to larger-scale funding. The methodology is modeled conceptually after a similar grant program initiated by Maui County, which serves as a precedent for this type of housing incentive.",
  "agency_impact": "The Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation (HHFDC) will be responsible for administering the fund allocation to the counties and submitting a program evaluation report to the Legislature. County housing agencies will bear the primary implementation burden, including processing applications and ensuring compliance, which may strain their existing capacity and staffing as noted by the City and County of Honolulu. These agencies will require resources for administration, enforcement, and managing potential liabilities.",
  "economic_impact": "This program is expected to increase the supply of affordable rental housing for local workers by incentivizing ADU construction. The deed restrictions aim to prevent these units from being used as short-term vacation rentals, thereby reducing speculation in the housing market. By providing more housing options, the measure could help stabilize the local workforce and generate economic activity through residential construction.",
  "policy_impact": "This measure introduces a new state-level equity purchase program to encourage ADU development, shifting from its original grant-based concept to allow the state to recoup its investment. It modifies state housing policy by creating a partnership where the state funds the program and counties implement it. The inclusion of a sunset clause and a reporting requirement indicates a cautious, data-driven approach to evaluating a new housing solution before making it permanent.",
  "revenue_sources": "The program will be funded by appropriations from the Rental Housing Revolving Fund. This represents a change from the initially proposed funding source, which was the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund. Repayments from homeowners, including a prorated share of appreciation, will eventually return to the Rental Housing Revolving Fund, creating a long-term, albeit delayed, revenue stream.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The program has a maximum annual expenditure of $2,000,000 from the Rental Housing Revolving Fund, beginning in FY 2026. Over a six-year period through FY 2031, this would amount to a potential maximum cost of $12,000,000. However, the program sunsets on December 31, 2030, so the allocation for FY 2031 would only be for half the fiscal year. The program requires HHFDC to oversee fund allocation and reporting, implying minor administrative costs at the state level. County agencies will also incur administrative costs, for which they can use an unspecified portion of the funds. As an equity purchase program, the state will eventually be repaid its investment plus appreciation within fifteen years or upon property sale. These repayments are unlikely to generate significant revenue within the initial six-year window. The bill also provides a Conveyance Tax exemption, resulting in a minor negative revenue impact for the state.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The measure will create a future positive impact on operating revenue for the Rental Housing Revolving Fund. As an equity purchase program, homeowners must repay the state's investment with appreciation within 15 years or upon sale of the property. However, this revenue will not be realized immediately and is unlikely to be significant within the first six years of the program. A minor negative revenue impact is expected from the exemption to the Conveyance Tax.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "This measure is not expected to have any direct capital expenditure impact on the state or counties. The appropriated funds are for an equity purchase program to help private homeowners finance the construction of accessory dwelling units. The program does not involve the state or counties acquiring, constructing, or improving any government-owned facilities or infrastructure.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "Since the program sunsets on December 31, 2030, there will be no new appropriations for this program after the initial period unless reauthorized by the Legislature. However, the state will maintain a long-term fiscal interest as HHFDC will continue to receive repayments from participating homeowners for up to fifteen years from each agreement's inception. These repayments will replenish the Rental Housing Revolving Fund, supporting future housing initiatives.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "This version of the bill includes several significant changes from its predecessor. The funding mechanism was changed from a grant program to an equity purchase program, allowing the state to recoup its investment with appreciation. The funding source was switched from the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund to the Rental Housing Revolving Fund, and a specific annual appropriation limit of $2,000,000 was established. Additionally, a sunset date of December 31, 2030, and a legislative reporting requirement for 2031 were added to evaluate the program as a pilot initiative."
