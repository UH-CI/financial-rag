  "overview": "This bill appropriates funds to continue the kauhale initiative, a program aimed at providing housing and healing spaces for individuals experiencing or at risk of homelessness. It establishes two new dedicated funding mechanisms: the supportive housing special fund to be administered by the Hawaii housing finance and development corporation (HHFDC) and the kauhale initiative special fund to be administered by the statewide office on homelessness and housing solutions. The measure aims to formalize and expand the State's capacity to develop supportive housing for populations with special needs.",
  "appropriations": "The bill appropriates $50,000,000 from general revenues for fiscal year 2025-2026 and the same for fiscal year 2026-2027 for the continued operation of the kauhale initiative. An additional appropriation of $12,000,000 from general revenues is made for each of those two fiscal years to be deposited into the new supportive housing special fund. From this special fund, $189,750 is allocated annually for one temporary full-time housing finance specialist position at HHFDC to administer the fund.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal projections are based directly on the specific appropriation amounts stipulated in the bill for fiscal years 2026 and 2027. The methodology for arriving at these specific appropriation figures is not detailed in the provided legislative text. However, the amounts are contextualized by previous legislative appropriations for related homelessness programs, such as the ohana zones pilot program and earlier funding for the kauhale and supportive housing initiatives.",
  "agency_impact": "This measure will significantly impact the statewide office on homelessness and housing solutions, which will administer the new kauhale initiative special fund and continue to lead the overall initiative. The Hawaii housing finance and development corporation (HHFDC) is tasked with administering the new supportive housing special fund, which includes developing rules, managing loans, and making payments for services. HHFDC will require the addition of one temporary full-time equivalent (1.0 FTE) housing finance specialist I to manage these new responsibilities.",
  "economic_impact": "The measure is expected to reduce homelessness by increasing the supply of supportive and affordable housing for vulnerable populations, including the chronically homeless, veterans, and individuals with disabilities. Providing stable housing and supportive services can lead to long-term cost savings for the state by potentially reducing expenditures on emergency medical services, law enforcement, and correctional facilities. These initiatives foster partnerships between government and community organizations to address homelessness, providing spaces for healing and promoting community responsibility.",
  "policy_impact": "This bill modifies existing state law by amending Chapter 201H, Hawaii Revised Statutes, to create the supportive housing special fund and Chapter 346, Hawaii Revised Statutes, to establish the kauhale initiative special fund. This action formalizes and provides dedicated, ongoing funding mechanisms for two key state strategies to combat homelessness. The measure moves beyond pilot programs to create permanent statutory frameworks, signaling a long-term commitment to developing supportive housing and community-based solutions.",
  "revenue_sources": "The primary revenue source identified in the bill is the state's general revenues, from which a total of $62,000,000 is appropriated for each of fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027. The newly created supportive housing special fund and kauhale initiative special fund are also authorized to accept other moneys. These sources include private contributions, proceeds from loan repayments, interest, service fees, and other program revenues.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "For fiscal years 2026 and 2027, the measure appropriates a total of $62,000,000 per year from the general fund. This consists of $50,000,000 annually for the kauhale initiative and $12,000,000 annually for the supportive housing special fund. The cost for the Hawaii housing finance and development corporation includes $189,750 per year for one temporary 1.0 FTE housing finance specialist, which is funded from the supportive housing special fund appropriation. Assuming the programs continue at the same level of effort, a similar annual general fund appropriation of $62,000,000 would likely be required for fiscal years 2028 through 2031. The continuation of the temporary position beyond FY 2027 would depend on future legislative authorization. The creation of the special funds establishes ongoing administrative responsibilities for the respective agencies. The non-lapsing nature of the kauhale appropriation allows funds to be carried over, potentially affecting expenditure timing across fiscal years. Long-term costs will be influenced by the number of housing units developed and the ongoing need for supportive services and rental assistance for residents. The special funds are designed to become partially self-sustaining through loan repayments and fees, but are expected to require continued general fund support.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The measure is expected to generate new operating revenue for the state through the two special funds it creates. The supportive housing special fund, administered by HHFDC, may collect revenue from loan repayments, interest, and reasonable service fees charged in connection with its financing activities. Similarly, the kauhale initiative special fund is authorized to receive program revenues, though the specific sources are not detailed.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "This bill authorizes the use of funds for significant capital expenditures related to housing. The supportive housing special fund can be used to finance the development, pre-development, construction, acquisition, and substantial rehabilitation of supportive housing projects. Likewise, the kauhale initiative funds are for the development and operation of kauhale, which can include the creation of new housing structures. While the measure provides the financial resources for these capital investments, it does not appropriate funds for specific, line-item capital improvement projects.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "After the initial six-year period, there will be ongoing fiscal obligations to sustain the housing projects and programs established under this measure. These long-term costs will include the operation and maintenance of kauhale and supportive housing units, as well as the continued provision of supportive services and rental assistance to residents. The permanency of the two special funds suggests a long-term state commitment, which will likely require continued general fund appropriations to address homelessness effectively.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "No previous fiscal note was provided for comparison."
