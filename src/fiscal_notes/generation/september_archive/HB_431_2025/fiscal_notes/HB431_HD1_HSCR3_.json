  "overview": "The proposed measure has been amended to remove the creation of the Kauhale Initiative Special Fund. It now provides funding for the Kauhale Initiative through a direct general fund appropriation to the Statewide Office on Homelessness and Housing Solutions. The bill still establishes the Supportive Housing Special Fund, but all specific appropriation amounts have been changed to be unspecified.",
  "appropriations": "All specific appropriation amounts have been removed from the bill. The previous appropriations of $50,000,000 per year for the Kauhale Initiative and $12,000,000 per year for the Supportive Housing Special Fund are now unspecified. Additionally, the provision making the Kauhale Initiative appropriation non-lapsing has been deleted, meaning funds will now lapse according to standard procedure.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal projections are now indeterminate as all specific appropriation amounts have been removed from the measure. Cost estimations will depend on the final amounts inserted by the legislature later in the process. The previous methodology based on stipulated appropriations is no longer applicable.",
  "agency_impact": "The impact on the Statewide Office on Homelessness and Housing Solutions has been revised; the agency will no longer be tasked with establishing and administering a new Kauhale Initiative Special Fund. Instead, it will manage a direct general fund appropriation. The impact on the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation remains, as it will still administer the new Supportive Housing Special Fund and is slated to receive one temporary FTE, though the funding for this is now unspecified.",
  "economic_impact": "",
  "policy_impact": "The measure no longer establishes the Kauhale Initiative Special Fund, a significant policy change from the original version. This revision reverts the long-term funding strategy for the Kauhale Initiative to the general fund appropriation process rather than creating a dedicated, ongoing special fund. The establishment of the Supportive Housing Special Fund remains, creating a permanent financing tool within the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation.",
  "revenue_sources": "The bill no longer creates a new revenue stream through the Kauhale Initiative Special Fund. The primary funding source continues to be general revenues, but the amounts are now unspecified. The Supportive Housing Special Fund is still authorized to receive funds from private contributions, loan repayments, interest, and fees.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "A multi-year fiscal outlook cannot be determined as all appropriations are now for unspecified amounts. The previous projection of $62,000,000 per year is no longer valid. Future costs are dependent on amounts to be determined by the legislature. The deletion of the non-lapsing provision for the Kauhale funds means expenditures must be planned within the standard fiscal biennium.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The potential for new operating revenue has been reduced, as the Kauhale Initiative Special Fund is no longer being created. The measure's impact on operating revenue is now limited to potential collections of loan repayments, interest, and fees by the newly established Supportive Housing Special Fund.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The primary changes from the previous version of the bill are the deletion of the Kauhale Initiative Special Fund and the removal of all specific appropriation amounts. Funding for the Kauhale Initiative has been changed from a special fund deposit to a direct general fund appropriation to the Statewide Office on Homelessness and Housing Solutions. Furthermore, the non-lapsing provision for the Kauhale Initiative appropriation has been removed."
