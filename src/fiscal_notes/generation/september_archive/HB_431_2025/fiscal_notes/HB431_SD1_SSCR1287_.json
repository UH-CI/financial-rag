{
  "overview": "The bill's scope has been significantly altered; it no longer establishes the Supportive Housing Special Fund. Instead, the measure now provides direct, albeit unspecified, general fund appropriations for three distinct purposes. These are the continued operation of the Kauhale Initiative, the continued implementation of the Ohana Zones Pilot Program, and funding for the Hawai‘i Housing Finance and Development Corporation to develop and operate supportive housing projects.",
  "appropriations": "The appropriation structure has been completely revised, replacing the proposed special fund with direct appropriations. The bill now contains three separate unspecified general fund appropriations for FY 2026 and FY 2027: one for the Kauhale Initiative, a new separate one for the Ohana Zones Pilot Program, and one for the Hawai‘i Housing Finance and Development Corporation's supportive housing activities. Consequently, the previous request for $175,000 for a position to manage the special fund is no longer applicable as the fund has been eliminated.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The previous fiscal concerns regarding the methodology and self-sustainability of the Supportive Housing Special Fund are now moot. The bill has been amended to remove the special fund entirely. The financial projections are now based on a direct general fund appropriation model, eliminating the uncertainty associated with a special fund's ability to be self-sustaining.",
  "agency_impact": "The bill's amendments directly address and resolve the operational concerns previously raised by multiple agencies. The deletion of the Supportive Housing Special Fund and its associated procurement exemption resolves the State Procurement Office's objections to a lack of oversight. Similarly, the removal of the requirement for at least two bidders on Kauhale projects over $1,000,000 nullifies the implementation concerns previously expressed by the Department of Human Services, and the Hawai‘i Housing Finance and Development Corporation's stated need for a 1.0 FTE position to manage the special fund is now obsolete.",
  "economic_impact": "",
  "policy_impact": "The significant policy conflicts identified in the previous version of the bill have been resolved through amendments. Deleting the Supportive Housing Special Fund addresses the Department of Budget and Finance's concerns regarding compliance with state statutes on special funds. This change, along with the removal of the associated procurement exemption, also aligns the bill with the State Procurement Office's recommendations, while the elimination of the two-bidder minimum for Kauhale projects resolves the policy issue raised by the Department of Human Services.",
  "revenue_sources": "The measure now explicitly relies on direct general fund appropriations as the sole revenue source. This clarifies the funding mechanism, which has changed from depositing general funds into a new special fund. The bill now designates three separate appropriations from the general fund for the Kauhale Initiative, the Ohana Zones Pilot Program, and HHFDC's supportive housing projects.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The fiscal outlook has changed significantly with the removal of the Supportive Housing Special Fund. The previously identified recurring annual cost of $175,000 for a dedicated FTE to manage the fund is no longer a certainty, as the position's justification has been eliminated. The six-year projection is now based on the assumption of direct general fund appropriations for the Kauhale Initiative, Ohana Zones Pilot Program, and HHFDC supportive housing activities. The potential project delays and cost impacts related to prior procurement and bidding rules are no longer a factor, simplifying the long-term cost estimation.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The basis for long-term fiscal obligations has shifted from managing a special fund to sustaining programs through direct state funding. The specific ongoing cost of $175,000 for an FTE is now uncertain, as its original purpose has been removed from the bill. The primary fiscal implication after six years is the potential need for continued general fund appropriations to maintain the operations of the Kauhale Initiative, Ohana Zones, and other supportive housing projects.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The bill has been substantially amended, deleting the proposed Supportive Housing Special Fund entirely and replacing it with direct general fund appropriations for HHFDC's supportive housing activities, the Kauhale Initiative, and the Ohana Zones Pilot Program. This fundamental change resolves all major agency concerns from the previous fiscal note: the Department of Budget and Finance's issue with the special fund's self-sustainability, the State Procurement Office's objection to a procurement exemption, and the Department of Human Services' opposition to a two-bidder minimum on Kauhale projects. Consequently, HHFDC's specific request for a $175,000 FTE position to manage the special fund is now obsolete."
