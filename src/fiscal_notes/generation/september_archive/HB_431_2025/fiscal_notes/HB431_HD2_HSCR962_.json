  "overview": "",
  "appropriations": "The Hawai‘i Housing Finance and Development Corporation (HHFDC) has requested a specific appropriation of $175,000 for one full-time equivalent (1.0 FTE) housing finance specialist position to administer the new Supportive Housing Special Fund. This request is in addition to the unspecified general fund appropriations for the Kauhale Initiative and the Supportive Housing Special Fund for fiscal years 2026 and 2027. The Department of Human Services has also requested the removal of a provision requiring at least two bidders for Kauhale projects over $1,000,000.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The Department of Budget and Finance has raised concerns about the methodology for the new Supportive Housing Special Fund, noting it is difficult to determine if the fund would be self-sustaining. This assessment is based on the criteria in Section 37-52.3, HRS, which requires special funds to demonstrate financial self-sufficiency. This introduces uncertainty into the long-term financial projections for the fund.",
  "agency_impact": "The Hawai‘i Housing Finance and Development Corporation anticipates needing one new permanent 1.0 FTE position at an annual cost of $175,000 to administer the Supportive Housing Special Fund. The State Procurement Office has recommended removing the bill's proposed procurement exemption for HHFDC, citing concerns over a lack of oversight, accountability, and transparency. In addition, the Department of Human Services has requested the deletion of the two-bidder minimum for large Kauhale projects, warning it may cause project delays.",
  "economic_impact": "Testimonies provide new data suggesting the measure could lead to significant public cost savings, citing studies that show supportive housing reduces hospital days by 23% and emergency room visits by 33%. Furthermore, supportive housing has been shown to lower criminal recidivism rates to 12.8%, compared to 50% for individuals without housing support. Data also indicates that 50-60% of individuals in Housing First programs voluntarily engage in substance abuse treatment once housed.",
  "policy_impact": "The measure has drawn policy-level concerns from multiple state agencies, indicating potential implementation challenges. The Department of Budget and Finance has questioned whether the establishment of the Supportive Housing Special Fund aligns with state policy on special funds as defined in statute. Concurrently, the State Procurement Office has objected to the proposed procurement exemption for the fund's administrator, while the Department of Human Services has opposed the new bidding requirements for Kauhale projects.",
  "revenue_sources": "",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "A new recurring cost has been identified, projecting an annual expense of $175,000 for one permanent FTE position at the Hawai‘i Housing Finance and Development Corporation to manage the Supportive Housing Special Fund. This adds a specific, ongoing operational cost to the fiscal outlook for the program. The overall six-year projection remains largely undefined due to the unspecified nature of the primary appropriations for the Kauhale Initiative and the special fund deposit. However, testimonies from agencies regarding procurement rules suggest potential impacts on project timelines and costs over the six-year period. The long-term fiscal impact will depend on the scale of projects funded and whether the special fund can achieve self-sustainability as questioned by the Department of Budget and Finance.",

  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "A new ongoing fiscal obligation has been identified, consisting of the annual $175,000 cost for one permanent FTE position at the Hawai‘i Housing Finance and Development Corporation to administer the Supportive Housing Special Fund. This operational cost is expected to continue indefinitely beyond the initial six-year period. The long-term sustainability of the fund itself has been questioned by the Department of Budget and Finance, which could impact its fiscal viability after the initial appropriations are expended.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "New information includes a specific budget request from the Hawai‘i Housing Finance and Development Corporation for $175,000 for one permanent FTE position to administer the Supportive Housing Special Fund. Several agencies have raised significant new concerns, including the Department of Human Services' request to remove the two-bidder minimum for large Kauhale projects, the State Procurement Office's opposition to a procurement exemption for HHFDC, and the Department of Budget and Finance's questions about the fund's statutory compliance and self-sustainability. Additionally, new economic data was introduced through testimony, quantifying the potential for cost savings in healthcare and reductions in criminal recidivism."
