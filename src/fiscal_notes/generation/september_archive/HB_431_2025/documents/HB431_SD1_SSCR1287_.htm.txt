Your Committees received comments on this
measure from the Department of Budget and Finance and State Procurement Office
.
Your Committees
find that to meet the State's needs for long-term solutions to homelessness and
the risk of homelessness, it is necessary for the State to develop the capacity
of the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation to work with
developers to create additional supportive housing units.
Your Committees further find that both the
Ohana Zones Pilot Program and the Kauhale Initiative aim to provide supportive
housing and services with an emphasis on community-based solutions.
This measure provides funding for the continued
implementation of the Ohana Zones Pilot Program and the Kauhale Initiative, in
addition to funding for the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation
for the development, operation, and maintenance of affordable, supportive
housing projects and the provision of supportive services, to further expand
affordable housing inventory and supportive services for individuals
experiencing or at the risk of homelessness throughout the State.
Your Committees have
amended this measure by:
(1)
Deleting
language that would have allowed funds appropriated for the continued
implementation of the Kauhale Initiative to be used for the Ohana Zones Pilot Program
established under Act 209, Session Laws of Hawaii 2018
;
(2)
Deleting
language that would have allowed:
(A)
The
Governor to
transfer all or a portion of the appropriations for the
continued implementation of the Kauhale Initiative to the Governor's designated
executive branch departments or agencies, including the Statewide Office on Homelessness
and Housing Solutions, for expenditures incurred to implement the Kauhale Initiative;
and
(B)
The Governor's designated executive branch
departments or agencies to expend the transferred appropriations for the
performance of their duties under the Kauhale Initiative;
(3)
Deleting language that would have provided
that if funds appropriated for the continued implementation of the Kauhale
Initiative are used to contract for the procurement of building services and
projects related to the Kauhale Initiative, there shall be at least two bidders
for any kauhale project estimated to be over $1,000,000;
(4)
Inserting
a blank appropriation amount for
the continued implementation of the Ohana Zones Pilot
Program

;

Inserting
a blank appropriation amount to be expended by the Hawaii Housing Finance and

Amending
the legislative findings of part III to reflect its amended purpose;
(9)

Making technical, nonsubstantive amendments

Office of the Governor provide to your Committee on Ways and Means the amounts
necessary for the continued implementation of the Kauhale Initiative and Ohana
Zones Pilot Program respectively, and the development, operation, and

should your Committee on Ways and Means choose to deliberate on this measure.
