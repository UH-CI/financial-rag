The purpose of this bill is to increase the tax rate on each cigarette or little cigar sold from 16.00 cents to 18.00 cents. Additionally, the bill amends the disposition of revenues collected at the amended rate by increasing the cigarette tax amount allocated to the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund from 2.0 cents to 4.0 cents per cigarette. Cigarette tax stamp revenues have plummeted, from over $116 million in fiscal year 2015-2016 to just over $70 million in fiscal year 2023-2024. This decline has affected the funding for the University of Hawaii Cancer Center, community health centers, trauma centers, and emergency medical services. Similarly, the Department’s Tobacco Enforcement Special Fund (Fund) has experienced a revenue decline due to reduced cigarettes sales. The Fund receives revenue from the cigarette tax stamp fee, which is directly tied to the cost of the cigarette tax stamp (see section 245-26, Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)).

The Legislature established the Fund in 2001 for the Department to administer, monitor, and enforce the MSA, the cigarette tax stamp program, and any other related statutes or programs (see section 28-15(a), HRS). If enforcement is deemed insufficient, tobacco manufacturers may challenge the payment, potentially leading to arbitration and significant financial losses to Hawaii. Hawaii received over $36.4 million in MSA payments for fiscal year 2023-2024. Recent arbitration decisions found Washington, Missouri, and New Mexico non-diligent, jeopardizing their annual MSA payments. These decisions highlight a critical need for stable funding for the Department to maintain and further its diligent enforcement efforts and reduce the risk of losing MSA revenue. The Department recognizes that continued reliance on declining cigarette tax revenue is unsustainable. Therefore, the Department asks that the Committee also consider House Bill No. 1085.

Hina Mauka provides this testimony as a member of the Hawaii Substance Abuse Coalition (HSAC) and also as a member of the Tobacco Coalition. We support the Tobacco coalition’s proposed amendment to add a $0.01 increase to the bill such that the cigarette tax increases from 16 cents to 19 cents ($0.01 more than the 18-cent tax in the bill.) Hina Mauka supports the Tobacco Coalition that any increase is applied by the existing formulas toward the special funds for cancer research, trauma systems, the Community Health Centers, and the emergency medical services special fund with any overflow going to the general fund to support much needed state revenues.

Smoking is the number one cause of preventable disease and death worldwide. In Hawaii, smoking-related healthcare costs $611 million per year, and smoking causes most lung cancers, with nearly 9 out of 10 lung cancers deaths caused by smoking cigarettes or secondhand smoke exposure. State agencies, healthcare professionals, health systems and insurers will continue to work together with lawmakers to reduce smoking and the associated cancer burden in Hawaii. The UH Cancer Center is an important partner in Hawaii’s progress for prevention, diagnosis and treatment of smoking related cancers. Modest increases in tax on tobacco products can not only induce some smokers to quit and deter others from starting, but also support Hawaii patient counseling, cessation remedies and",

I am submitting testimony today to strongly oppose HB 441, which would raise cigarette taxes even higher than the $3.40 per pack tax it is today. I get why the state wants to reduce smoking, but raising taxes again isn’t the answer. We’ve already seen the damage these kinds of tax hikes do, and this bill will only make things worse. More Taxes = More Illegal Sales Let’s be real—when taxes get too high, people don’t just stop smoking. They find other ways to get their cigarettes, whether that means buying from the black market, asking friends to bring them in from out of state, or switching to untaxed alternatives. We’ve already seen this happen with the 70% vapor tax",

A $1 increase per pack would lead to: • 2,400 adults in Hawai‘i quitting smoking • 100 young adults (ages 18-24) quitting smoking • A 7.4% decrease in youth under 18 who smoke These reductions in tobacco use translate directly to lower healthcare costs, fewer smoking- related illnesses, and a healthier future for our keiki and communities.

    "text": "Testimony in Support of HB441 HD1 with Amendments February 5, 2025 Aloha Honorable Chair, Vice Chair, and Members of the Committee, My name is Kealoha Madriaga and I am submitting this testimony in strong support of HB 441, with amendments. While the proposed 40-cent increase in the cigarette tax is a step in the right direction, we urge the committee to consider a $1 increase per pack to maximize public health benefits and revenue impact. Research consistently shows that higher cigarette taxes are one of the most effective ways to reduce tobacco use, especially among youth and young adults. A $1 increase per pack would lead to: • 2,400 adults in Hawai‘i quitting smoking • 100 young adults (ages 18-24) quitting smoking • A 7.4% decrease in youth under 18 who smoke These reductions in tobacco use translate directly to lower healthcare costs, fewer smoking- related illnesses, and a healthier future for our keiki and communities. Beyond public health benefits, a $1 tax increase per pack would generate an estimated $11.46 million annually in additional state revenue. These funds could further support cancer research, tobacco prevention programs, and healthcare initiatives to improve the well-being of Hawai‘i residents. Increasing cigarette taxes is",

    "text": "HB441. This bill increases the cigarette tax by 40 cents, directed to the Cancer Research Special Fund. The American Academy of Pediatrics strongly supports regulation and taxation of tobacco products to prevent initiation of use, especially by young people. Nicotine is a highly addictive drug that impacts the adolescent brain, reducing impulse control and affecting mood. Once young people are addicted to nicotine, it is extremely difficult to quit. Many studies have shown that increased cigarette prices lead to fewer youth smokers and decreased health costs overall. Finally, please consider amending this bill to increase the tax by at least $1.00 per pack which would provide additional benefits in further reducing youth initiation of smoking. Please support this important measure with the requested amendment. Mahalo for your consideration.

To increase it's effectiveness, the tax should be increased to at least $1. If it was increased by $1, research indicates it would result in: - 2,400 adults quitting - 100 young adults quitting - A 7.4% decrease in youth under 18 that smoke. Additionally, the projected revenue from the increase could support more public health initiatives. Please support the health of our community and pass HB441 HD1 with an amendment making the tax increase to $1 a pack.

Stacey, Deputy Attorney General, at 808-586-1199) Chair Dela Cruz and Members of the Committee: The Department of the Attorney General (Department) supports this bill and offers the following comments. The purpose of this bill is to increase the tax rate on each cigarette or little cigar sold from sixteen cents to eighteen cents. Additionally, the bill amends the disposition of cigarette tax revenues by allocating the two-cent increase in the tax to the University of Hawaii for purposes of debt reduction for the Cancer Research Center of Hawaii. Cigarette tax stamp revenues have plummeted, from over $116 million in fiscal year 2015-2016 to just over $70 million in fiscal year 2023-2024. This decline has affected the funding for the University of Hawaii Cancer Center, community health centers, trauma centers, and emergency medical services. Similarly, the Department’s Tobacco Enforcement Special Fund (Fund) has experienced a revenue decline due to reduced cigarettes sales. The Fund receives revenue from the cigarette tax stamp fee, which is directly tied to the cost of the cigarette tax stamp (see section 245-26, Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)).

To maintain these payments, states must diligently enforce the requirements of the \"model statute,\" which Hawaii enacted as the Tobacco Liability Act, chapter 675, HRS. The Legislature established the Fund in 2001 for the Department to administer, monitor, and enforce the MSA, the cigarette tax stamp program, and any other related statutes or programs (see section 28-15(a), HRS). If enforcement is deemed insufficient, tobacco manufacturers may challenge the payment, potentially leading to arbitration and significant financial losses to Hawaii. Hawaii received over $36.4 million in MSA payments for fiscal year 2023-2024. Recent arbitration decisions found Washington, Missouri, and New Mexico non-diligent, jeopardizing their annual MSA payments. These decisions highlight a critical need for stable funding for the Department to maintain and further its diligent enforcement efforts and reduce the risk of losing MSA revenue.

Smoking is the number one cause of preventable disease and death worldwide. In Hawaii, smoking-related healthcare costs $611 million per year, and smoking causes most lung cancers, with nearly 9 out of 10 lung cancers deaths caused by smoking cigarettes or secondhand smoke exposure. State agencies, healthcare professionals, health systems and insurers will continue to work together with lawmakers to reduce smoking and the associated cancer burden in Hawaii. The UH Cancer Center is an important partner in Hawaii’s progress for prevention, diagnosis and treatment of smoking related cancers. Modest increases in tax on tobacco products can not only induce some smokers to quit and deter others from starting, but also support Hawaii patient counseling, cessation remedies and",

Mahalo for this opportunity to submit testimony in support of the intent of HB 441, HD2, SD1 Relating to Taxation, but urging an amendment to increase the proposed tax amount to $1.00 per pack, or 5-cents per stick, to fully recognize the health benefits of such a tax increase. Tobacco taxes have long been proven as an effective way to reduce tobacco consumption, especially among price sensitive young people and people from lower income populations. Because smoking levels are highest among people with low incomes, the cigarette companies have tried to argue against tobacco taxes as regressive and falling disproportionately hard on lower-income families and communities. But this argument turns reality upside down. The fact that smoking rates are highest among lower-income groups means that lower-income families and communities currently suffer the",

The staggered implementation also weakened the potential positive health impact by keeping cigarettes more affordable to existing users, as well as to new potential young users targeted by the companies). Since that time, inflation has decreased significantly not only the value of the cigarette tax in terms of tax revenue value, but particularly in terms of its positive health impact. It’s time to boost cigarette taxes by a minimum of $1.00 per pack (the lowest amount determined by economic experts to have a meaningful health impact by making it difficult for tobacco companies to dull that health impact through the short-term use of discount offers) to again benefit from the consumption reduction and health benefits for which the tax is intended. I urge you to support HB 441, HD 2, SD1, but to amend the bill by increasing the tax by a minimum one- time $1.00 per pack (5 cents per stick).

However, I urge the committee to consider a stronger and more effective step: a $1 increase per pack, not just 2 cents per cigarette. This would: Further reduce smoking, especially among youth, Generate significantly more funding for cancer research and debt reduction, and Align Hawaii with other leading states in tobacco control policy. Every dollar spent preventing cancer today saves many more in treatment and loss of life tomorrow. \u0010\u0005\u0018 Mahalo for your consideration.",

Stacey, Deputy Attorney General Chairs San Buenaventura and Kim and Members of the Committees: The Department of the Attorney General (Department) supports this bill and offers the following comments. The purpose of this bill is to increase the tax rate on each cigarette or little cigar sold. Additionally, the bill amends the disposition of revenues collected at the amended rate by increasing the cigarette tax amount allocated to the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund. Cigarette tax stamp revenues have plummeted, from over $116 million in fiscal year 2015-2016 to just over $70 million in fiscal year 2023-2024. This decline has affected the funding for the University of Hawaii Cancer Center, community health centers, trauma centers, and emergency medical services. Similarly, the Department’s Tobacco Enforcement Special Fund (Fund) has experienced a revenue decline due to reduced cigarettes sales. The Fund receives revenue from the cigarette tax stamp fee, which is directly tied to the cost of the cigarette tax stamp (see section 245-26, Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)). The revenue deposited into the Fund has dropped from $1.74 million in fiscal year 2015-2016 to $1.03",

Stacey, Deputy Attorney General Chairs San Buenaventura and Kim and Members of the Committees: The Department of the Attorney General (Department) supports this bill and offers the following comments. The purpose of this bill is to increase the tax rate on each cigarette or little cigar sold. Additionally, the bill amends the disposition of revenues collected at the amended rate by increasing the cigarette tax amount allocated to the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund.

To maintain these payments, states must diligently enforce the requirements of the \"model statute,\" which Hawaii enacted as the Tobacco Liability Act, chapter 675, HRS. The Legislature established the Fund in 2001 for the Department to administer, monitor, and enforce the MSA, the cigarette tax stamp program, and any other related statutes or programs (see section 28-15(a), HRS). If enforcement is deemed insufficient, tobacco manufacturers may challenge the payment, potentially leading to arbitration and significant financial losses to Hawaii. Hawaii received over $36.4 million in MSA payments for fiscal year 2023-2024. Recent arbitration decisions found Washington, Missouri, and New Mexico non-diligent, jeopardizing their annual MSA payments. These decisions highlight a critical need for stable funding for the Department to maintain and further its diligent enforcement efforts and reduce the risk of losing MSA revenue. The attached chart demonstrates the flow of the cigarette and tobacco tax and license money.

The UH Cancer Center is in strong support of HB 441 HD2, which, as originally introduced, would increase the cigarette tax from $0.16 to $0.18 per cigarette. Currently, the cigarette tax revenues are allocated where $0.02 supports Hawaiʻi’s Cancer Center. The bill would provide for an additional $0.02 in the cigarette tax amount allocated to the Hawaiʻi cancer research special fund (for a total of $0.04 per cigarette). Funding from the cigarette tax has been instrumental since this fund’s inception in 2006, enabling the construction of the UH Cancer Center building and the launching of strategic initiatives to combat cancer. However, due to the success of smoking cessation efforts, this allocation has declined, indicating both progress in public health and a concerning decrease",

Beginning in 2006, Hawaii lawmakers enacted a several-year scheme which gradually increased state cigarette excise collections including: • 2006: $0.20 increase to $1.60/pack • 2007: $0.20 increase to $1.80/pack • 2008: $0.20 increase to $2.00/pack • 2009: $0.60 increase to $2.60/pack • 2010: $0.40 increase to $3.00/pack • 2011: $0.20 increase to $3.20/pack The tax increases did lead to several years of increased cigarette tax revenue. The Aloha State collected $135.6 million in cigarette excise taxes in 2011, which was a 63.2 percent increase from 2005’s $83.1 million – or an additional $52.5 million. However, these increases were not experienced in the long term, with cigarette tax revenue declining each year since 2012. In 2023, Hawaii collected $76.8 million in cigarette excise taxes, which was 43.4 percent decrease from 2011’s increases, or $58.8 million less. Further, 2023’s revenue was down by 7.6 percent compared to what the state collected in 2005 – or prior to the start of enacting the increased taxes. Given the volatility of cigarette tax revenue, policymakers should refrain from both increasing these taxes, as well as earmarking them for existing programs.

    "text": "raise the tax on tobacco, limit exposure to secondhand smoke and discourage the use of tobacco by youth. Increasing tobacco taxes are a proven way to help reduce youth use. Hawaii raised its cigarette tax over 12 years ago in 2011, and this resulted in a decline of youth usage. In 2011, 10% of youth reported currently using cigarettes. This percentage decreased by half in 2019. AHA strongly believes that it is time for another increase, for the health and well- being of Hawaii’s keiki and population at large. We strongly support an amendment to HB 441 to implement a $1.00 tax increase for a pack of cigarettes. Such an amendment will significantly benefit public health by further reducing cigarette use and dependence. We appreciate the legislature for taking on this important policy consideration and appreciate the committees hearing this measure.

Smoking is the number one cause of preventable disease and death worldwide. In Hawaii, smoking-related healthcare costs $611 million per year, and smoking causes most lung cancers, with nearly 9 out of 10 lung cancers deaths caused by smoking cigarettes or secondhand smoke exposure. State agencies, healthcare professionals, health systems and insurers will continue to work together with lawmakers to reduce smoking and the associated cancer burden in Hawaii. The UH Cancer Center is an important partner in Hawaii’s progress for prevention, diagnosis and treatment of smoking related cancers. Modest increases in tax on tobacco products can not only induce some smokers to quit and deter others from starting, but also support Hawaii patient counseling, cessation remedies and",

Significant increases to a state’s tobacco tax have consistently produced a substantial increase in tax revenues and are less volatile than other revenue resources. This would help provide much needed revenues to the special fund for cancer research in Hawai’i, as well as the other special funds supported by the state tobacco tax. Raising the price of a pack of cigarettes by $1 won’t just contribute more money, it will contribute to reducing the smoking of cigarettes by youths and adults alike.

There is ample research concerning the benefit of increasing cigarette taxes. The research supports the fact that the larger the tax increase, the greater the benefit will accrue related to cigarette use, both short and long term improved health, decreased state health costs, and increase in state revenue. An increase of $1.00 per pack will generate $11.46 million per annum and a long-term savings in health care expenses of $611 million. The projected decrease in youth cigarette smoking by increasing cigarette taxes to $1/ pack is 7.4%. I am encouraged that the State Legislature is attacking the problem of tobacco use by using this taxation tool. It has proven to be quite successful in the past on Kauai.

Tobacco taxes have long been proven as an effective way to reduce tobacco consumption, especially among price sensitive young people and people from lower income populations. Because smoking levels are highest among people with low incomes, the cigarette companies have tried to argue against tobacco taxes as regressive and fall disproportionately hard on lower-income families and communities. But this argument turns reality upside down. The fact that smoking rates are highest among lower-income groups means that lower-income families and communities currently suffer the",

Because of their higher rate of illness and disability, smokers have substantially higher annual and lifetime healthcare costs than nonsmokers or former smokers (despite living shorter lives). According to the Hawaii Department of Health, smoking-related health care expenditures total more than $209,957 per Hawaii smoker. Smoking rate declines caused by a state cigarette tax increase would directly reduce these tobacco- caused tax burdens. • Any significant state cigarette tax increase also would bring in millions of dollars per year in new government revenues, thereby reducing pressures for other, broader-based tax increases and possibly even making broad-based tax cuts more likely. Cigarette tax increases are also often used as an alternative to cuts to the funding of state government programs that serve low-income communities. • The smoking declines produced by cigarette tax increases save lives, reduce human suffering, promote the public health, and",

The purpose of this bill is to increase the tax rate on each cigarette or little cigar sold. Additionally, the bill amends the disposition of revenues collected at the amended rate by increasing the cigarette tax amount allocated to the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund. Cigarette tax stamp revenues have plummeted, from over $116 million in fiscal year 2015-2016 to just over $70 million in fiscal year 2023-2024.

To maintain these payments, states must diligently enforce the requirements of the \"model statute,\" which Hawaii enacted as the Tobacco Liability Act, chapter 675, HRS. The Legislature established the Fund in 2001 for the Department to administer, monitor, and enforce the MSA, the cigarette tax stamp program, and any other related statutes or programs (see section 28-15(a), HRS). If enforcement is deemed insufficient, tobacco manufacturers may challenge the payment, potentially leading to arbitration and significant financial losses to Hawaii. Hawaii received over $36.4 million in MSA payments for fiscal year 2023-2024. Recent arbitration decisions found Washington, Missouri, and New Mexico non-diligent, jeopardizing their annual MSA payments. These decisions highlight a critical need for stable funding for the Department to maintain and further its diligent enforcement efforts and reduce the risk of losing MSA revenue. The Department recognizes that continued reliance on declining cigarette tax revenue is unsustainable. Therefore, the Department asks that the Committee also consider House Bill No. 1085. House Bill No. 1085 similarly raises the cigarette tax rate; however, this bill aims to move away from relying on cigarette taxes and",

Hina Mauka provides this testimony as a member of the Hawaii Substance Abuse Coalition (HSAC) and also as a member of the Tobacco Coalition.

Hina Mauka supports the Tobacco Coalition that any increase is applied by the existing formulas toward the special funds for cancer research, trauma systems, the Community Health Centers, and the emergency medical services special fund with any overflow going to the general fund to support much needed state revenues.

Beginning in 2006, Hawaii lawmakers enacted a several-year scheme which gradually increased state cigarette excise collections including: • 2006: $0.20 increase to $1.60/pack • 2007: $0.20 increase to $1.80/pack • 2008: $0.20 increase to $2.00/pack • 2009: $0.60 increase to $2.60/pack • 2010: $0.40 increase to $3.00/pack • 2011: $0.20 increase to $3.20/pack The tax increases did lead to several years of increased cigarette tax revenue. The Aloha State collected $135.6 million in cigarette excise taxes in 2011, which was a 63.2 percent increase from 2005’s $83.1 million – or an additional $52.5 million. However, these increases were not experienced in the long term, with cigarette tax revenue declining each year since 2012. In 2023, Hawaii collected $76.8 million in cigarette excise taxes, which was 43.4 percent decrease from 2011’s increases, or $58.8 million less. Further, 2023’s revenue was down by 7.6 percent compared to what the state collected in 2005 – or prior to the start of enacting the increased taxes.

The American Academy of Pediatrics strongly supports regulation and taxation of tobacco products to prevent initiation of use, especially by young people. Nicotine is a highly addictive drug that impacts the adolescent brain, reducing impulse control and affecting mood. Once young people are addicted to nicotine, it is extremely difficult to quit. Many studies have shown that increased cigarette prices lead to fewer youth smokers and decreased health costs overall. Finally, please support the amendments to this bill that increase the tax by at least $1.00 per pack, which would provide additional benefits in further reducing youth initiation of smoking.

Because of their higher rate of illness and disability, smokers have substantially higher annual and lifetime healthcare costs than nonsmokers or former smokers (despite living shorter lives). According to the Hawaii Department of Health, smoking-related health care expenditures total more than $209,957 per Hawaii smoker. Smoking rate declines caused by a state cigarette tax increase would directly reduce these tobacco- caused tax burdens. • Any significant state cigarette tax increase also would bring in millions of dollars per year in new government revenues, thereby reducing pressures for other, broader-based tax increases and possibly even making broad-based tax cuts more likely. Cigarette tax increases are also often used as an alternative to cuts to the funding of state government programs that serve low-income communities. • The smoking declines produced by cigarette tax increases save lives, reduce human suffering, promote the public health, and",

The staggered implementation also weakened the potential positive health impact by keeping cigarettes more affordable to existing users, as well as to new potential young users targeted by the companies). Since that time, inflation has decreased significantly not only the value of the cigarette tax in terms of tax revenue value, but particularly in terms of its positive health impact. It’s time to boost cigarette taxes by a minimum of $1.00 per pack (the lowest amount determined by economic experts to have a meaningful health impact by making it difficult for tobacco companies to dull that health impact through the short-term use of discount offers) to again benefit from the consumption reduction and health benefits for which the tax is intended.

The Legislature established the Fund in 2001 for the Department to administer, monitor, and enforce the MSA, the cigarette tax stamp program, and any other related statutes or programs (see section 28-15(a), HRS). If enforcement is deemed insufficient, tobacco manufacturers may challenge the payment, potentially leading to arbitration and significant financial losses to Hawaii. Hawaii received over $36.4 million in MSA payments for fiscal year 2023-2024. Recent arbitration decisions found Washington, Missouri, and New Mexico non-diligent, jeopardizing their annual MSA payments. These decisions highlight a critical need for stable funding for the Department to maintain and further its diligent enforcement efforts and reduce the risk of losing MSA revenue. The Department recognizes that continued reliance on declining cigarette tax revenue is unsustainable. Therefore, the Department asks that the Committee also consider House Bill No. 1082.

UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI‘I SYSTEM ʻŌNAEHANA KULANUI O HAWAIʻI Legislative Testimony Hōʻike Manaʻo I Mua O Ka ʻAhaʻōlelo _____________________________________________________________ 1 Testimony Presented Before the House Committee on Health Wednesday, January 29, 2025 at 10:00 a.m. By Naoto T. Ueno, Director University of Hawai‘i Cancer Center And Michael Bruno, Provost University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa HB 441 – RELATING TO CIGARETTE TAXES Chair Takayama, Vice Chair Keohokapu-Lee Loy, and Members of the Committee: Thank you for the opportunity to present our testimony today. The UH Cancer Center is in strong support of HB 441, which would increase the cigarette tax from $0.16 to $0.18 per cigarette.

Smoking is the number one cause of preventable disease and death worldwide. In Hawaii, smoking-related healthcare costs $611 million per year, and smoking causes most lung cancers, with nearly 9 out of 10 lung cancers deaths caused by smoking cigarettes or secondhand smoke exposure. State agencies, healthcare professionals, health systems and insurers will continue to work together with lawmakers to reduce smoking and the associated cancer burden in Hawaii. The UH Cancer Center is an important partner in Hawaii’s progress for prevention, diagnosis and treatment of smoking related cancers. Modest increases in tax on tobacco products can not only induce some smokers to quit and deter others from starting, but also support Hawaii patient counseling, cessation remedies and",

Given the epic lows in young adult smoking rates, lawmakers must refrain from policies that restrict access to alternatives to smoking. Hawaii currently imposes a $3.20-per-pack state cigarette excise tax. Lawmakers often justify excise taxes on cigarettes to deter persons from using combustible cigarettes These taxes not only disproportionately harm lower income and lower educated adults; the taxes also fail to significantly reduce smoking rates among those persons.

While Hawaii collected $117.7 million in tobacco-related monies in 2023, the state allocated only $7.6 million in state funding towards tobacco control programs, including cessation, education, and youth prevention efforts, which was a 2.7 percent increase in funding from 2022’s $7.4 million, or an additional $200,000. This amounts to 9.9 percent of taxes and 18.6 percent of settlement payments. In 2023, for every $1 the state received in tobacco monies, it spent only $0.06 on tobacco control efforts. Between 2003 and 2023, Hawaii collected more than $3.1 billion tobacco monies, yet spent only $168.6 million (or 5.4 percent) on tobacco control efforts during the same period. Data on adult smoking rates comes from the Centers for Disease Control's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey including sections on \"Demographics - Race,\" Tobacco Use - All Categories,\" and \"E-Cigarette Use.\" Accessed October, 2024. https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/brfssprevalence/. 1. Data on race and age was compiled using population data from the Annie E. Casey Foundation (https://datacenter.kidscount.org/) and Demographic data from the CDC to cross reference the racial population. Then, data from Smoking and Race, and E-Cigaretts and Age, was used to determine the percent of adults who were smoking in 2023.",

HB 441 Relating to Cigarette Tax To the HLT Committee: I am submitting this testimony relating to cigarette taxes as a long- time Kauai pediatrician concerned with the health of the Hawaii population, both children and adults. There is ample research concerning the benefit of increasing cigarette taxes. The research supports the fact that the larger the tax increase, the greater the benefit will accrue related to cigarette use, both short and long term improved health, decreased state health costs, and increase in state revenue. I suggest that HB 441 be amended to increase cigarette taxes to $1 per pack, instead of 40 cents. Not only will there be a larger decrease in smoking, but the increase in state revenue is predicted to be $11.46 million per annum. I am encouraged that the State Legislature is attacking the problem of tobacco use by using this taxation tool. My only concern is the relatively modest increase in cigarette taxes. I think we can do better and medical studies support this.

    "text": "HB441. This bill increases the cigarette tax by 40 cents, directed to the Cancer Research Special Fund. The American Academy of Pediatrics strongly supports regulation and taxation of tobacco products to prevent initiation of use, especially by young people. Nicotine is a highly addictive drug that impacts the adolescent brain, reducing impulse control and affecting mood. Once young people are addicted to nicotine, it is extremely difficult to quit. Many studies have shown that increased cigarette prices lead to fewer youth smokers and decreased health costs overall. Finally, please consider amending this bill to increase the tax by at least $1.00 per pack which would provide additional benefits in further reducing youth initiation of smoking. Please support this important measure with the requested amendment. Mahalo for your consideration.
