  "overview": "The bill has been amended to remove the specific tax rate and revenue allocations, making these amounts unspecified (HB441_HD2). The House Committee on Higher Education's report now recommends that the Committee on Finance consider establishing a tax rate of 18.00 cents for each cigarette (HB441_HD2_HSCR470_). The report also recommends allocating 4.0 cents per cigarette from this tax to the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund (HB441_HD2_HSCR470_).",
  "appropriations": "While the previous version of the bill specified appropriation amounts, the current bill leaves these figures unspecified for future determination (HB441_HD2). A new committee report recommends that after June 30, 2025, the cigarette tax revenue be deposited as follows: 4.0 cents per cigarette to the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund, 1.125 cents per cigarette (capped at $7,400,000 (HB441_HD2_HSCR470_)) to the Trauma System Special Fund, and 1.25 cents per cigarette (capped at $8,800,000 (HB441_HD2_HSCR470_)) to both the Community Health Centers Special Fund and the Emergency Medical Services Special Fund (HB441_HD2_HSCR470_). These appropriations are now formal recommendations rather than codified amounts in the bill text.",

  "policy_impact": "The primary policy update is the legislative strategy of amending the bill to contain unspecified fiscal amounts (HB441_HD2). This defers the final decision on tax rates and revenue distribution to the Committee on Finance. This approach allows the bill to advance while providing the finance committee with specific recommendations for consideration, as outlined in the accompanying committee report (HB441_HD2_HSCR470_).",

  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The bill has been amended to leave the cigarette tax rate and revenue disposition amounts unspecified, deferring the specific fiscal details to a later committee (HB441_HD2). A committee report recommends setting the tax rate at 18.00 cents per cigarette after July 1, 2025, and details the proposed allocations (HB441_HD2_HSCR470_). Specifically, it recommends 4.0 cents per cigarette for the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund, 1.125 cents for the Trauma System Special Fund with a cap of $7,400,000 (HB441_HD2_HSCR470_), 1.25 cents for the Community Health Centers Special Fund with a cap of $8,800,000 (HB441_HD2_HSCR470_), and 1.25 cents for the Emergency Medical Services Special Fund, also capped at $8,800,000 (HB441_HD2_HSCR470_). Although the bill's placeholder effective date of July 1, 3000 (HB441_HD2) means no immediate impact, these recommendations outline the financial structure intended for future implementation.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The current version of the bill makes the proposed increase to the cigarette tax and the corresponding revenue dispositions unspecified (HB441_HD2). A new committee report recommends that the allocation for the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund be set at 4.0 cents per cigarette after June 30, 2025 (HB441_HD2_HSCR470_). This recommended change would double the current allocation and aims to increase revenues for the fund to counteract the effects of declining cigarette sales.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The bill was amended to remove specific financial figures, creating future uncertainty (HB441_HD2). However, a committee report now provides a clear recommendation for the long-term funding structure, suggesting a permanent increase in the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund's allocation to 4.0 cents per cigarette (HB441_HD2_HSCR470_). This strategy is intended to ensure the fund's fiscal stability despite the long-term trend of decreasing cigarette consumption.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The primary change is that the bill text (HB441_HD2) has been amended to remove specific tax and funding amounts, making them unspecified. These figures are now included as recommendations in the House Committee on Higher Education's report (HB441_HD2_HSCR470_), which suggests an 18.00 cent tax rate and a 4.0 cent allocation to the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund for the Committee on Finance to consider. The report also reiterates the proposed funding caps for other health-related special funds, including $7,400,000 (HB441_HD2_HSCR470_) for the Trauma System Special Fund and $8,800,000 (HB441_HD2_HSCR470_) each for two other funds."
