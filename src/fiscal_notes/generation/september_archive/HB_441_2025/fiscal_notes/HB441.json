  "overview": "This bill proposes to increase the excise tax on cigarettes and little cigars from 16 cents (HB441) to 18 cents (HB441) per item, effective January 1, 2026. The purpose of this measure is to address declining cigarette tax revenues that fund the University of Hawaii Cancer Center. The entire 2-cent increase will be allocated to the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund to ensure payment for debt service on revenue bonds and support the center's research and operations.",
  "appropriations": "This bill does not make a direct appropriation of a specific dollar amount. Instead, it amends the disposition of tax revenues by increasing the allocation to the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund. Effective January 1, 2026, the allocation to the fund will increase from 2.0 cents (HB441) per cigarette to 4.0 cents (HB441) per cigarette, with the additional revenue designated for debt service and building maintenance until June 30, 2041 (HB441).",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal projections are based on the assumption that the volume of cigarette sales will continue, though the bill acknowledges a historical decline in smoking rates. The methodology for calculating the revenue increase involves multiplying the projected number of cigarettes sold by the tax increase of 2 cents (HB441) per cigarette. The provided documents do not contain data on cigarette sales volume, so the exact fiscal impact is indeterminate but will directly correlate with future sales.",
  "agency_impact": "The Department of Taxation will be responsible for administering and collecting the increased tax, which may require minor updates to forms and procedures. The University of Hawaii will experience a positive budgetary impact through increased, dedicated funding for the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund. This will provide greater financial stability for the University of Hawaii Cancer Center's operations, research activities, and satisfaction of its debt service obligations.",
  "economic_impact": "The measure is expected to increase revenue for the state's Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund, supporting critical cancer research and treatment services. By raising the cost of cigarettes, the bill may further discourage smoking, potentially leading to long-term public health cost savings. However, it will also increase costs for consumers who purchase tobacco products.",
  "policy_impact": "This bill amends Hawaii Revised Statutes sections 245-3 and 245-15 to modify the state's cigarette tax rate and the formula for revenue distribution. It reinforces the state's policy of utilizing tobacco taxes to fund public health initiatives, specifically addressing the financial instability faced by the University of Hawaii Cancer Center due to declining smoking rates. The measure ensures a dedicated revenue stream to cover debt service for the Cancer Center's capital improvement revenue bonds.",
  "revenue_sources": "The sole revenue source for this measure is the state's excise tax on cigarettes and little cigars. The bill increases the tax rate from 16.00 cents (HB441) to 18.00 cents (HB441) per cigarette or little cigar. All revenue generated from the 2-cent tax increase is designated for deposit into the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "Beginning January 1, 2026, this bill increases the cigarette tax by 2 cents (HB441) per cigarette, raising the total tax to 18 cents (HB441). This change will increase the allocation to the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund from 2.0 cents (HB441) to 4.0 cents (HB441) per cigarette. This additional revenue is specifically directed toward debt service and building maintenance for the Cancer Center until June 30, 2041 (HB441). The fiscal impact is indeterminate as it depends on future cigarette sales, which have been declining. Other special fund allocations from the cigarette tax revenue remain unchanged, with the trauma system special fund capped at $7,400,000 (HB441) annually, and the community health centers special fund and emergency medical services special fund each capped at $8,800,000 (HB441) annually. The measure is intended to provide a stable, recurring revenue stream to meet the Cancer Center's financial obligations over the next six years and beyond. The increased tax will result in an overall increase in state special fund revenues, with the specific amount fluctuating based on consumption.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "This measure will increase the state's non-general fund operating revenues. The tax on each cigarette will increase by 2 cents (HB441), and the resulting revenue will be deposited into the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund. This directly increases the revenue available to the University of Hawaii Cancer Center for its operations and debt service.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The bill does not authorize new capital expenditures but secures funding for existing obligations. The increased revenue allocated to the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund is mandated to be used for debt service of capital expenditures and building maintenance until June 30, 2041 (HB441). This ensures continued payments on the revenue bonds used to construct the University of Hawaii Cancer Center.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "After the initial six-year period, the fiscal structure established by this bill is expected to continue. The cigarette tax will remain at 18 cents (HB441) per cigarette, with 4.0 cents (HB441) per cigarette continuing to be deposited into the Hawaii Cancer Research Special Fund. This provides a long-term funding mechanism for the Cancer Center's debt service and operations, though the total revenue will likely continue to decline in line with smoking rates.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "No previous fiscal note was provided for comparison."
