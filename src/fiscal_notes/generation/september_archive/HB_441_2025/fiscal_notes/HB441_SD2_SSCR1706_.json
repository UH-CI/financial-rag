  "overview": "The bill has been amended to direct the increased tax revenue into the Hawaii cancer research special fund, resolving a previously noted ambiguity (HB441_SD2_SSCR1706_). The amended bill specifies that the full 4.0 cents per cigarette (HB441_SD2) allocated to the fund will be used exclusively for debt service of capital expenditures and building maintenance until June 30, 2041 (HB441_SD2). This change restricts the use of all funds allocated to the cancer research special fund for a period of nearly two decades.",
  "appropriations": "The appropriation has been amended to specify that the entire 4.0 cents per cigarette (HB441_SD2) allocated to the Hawaii cancer research special fund must now be used exclusively for debt service of capital expenditures and building maintenance until June 30, 2041 (HB441_SD2). This is a change from earlier testimony which recommended that only half of this amount, 2.0 cents per cigarette, be dedicated to debt service (HB441_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_). This new provision restricts the use of the entire special fund allocation, not just the revenue from the tax increase.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "",
  "agency_impact": "The previously noted ambiguity regarding the disposition of funds has been resolved, as the bill now specifies that the increased revenues will be deposited directly into the Hawaii cancer research special fund (HB441_SD2_SSCR1706_). However, the University of Hawaii Cancer Center's operational flexibility is now impacted, as the bill restricts the use of the entire 4.0 cents per cigarette (HB441_SD2) allocation to debt service and building maintenance until 2041 (HB441_SD2). This removes the availability of these funds for research and operating expenses during this period.",
  "economic_impact": "",
  "policy_impact": "The bill has been amended to more narrowly define the policy objective, shifting from general debt reduction to a specific mandate for debt service of capital expenditures and building maintenance until June 30, 2041 (HB441_SD2). This policy change dedicates the entire cigarette tax revenue stream for the cancer center to facility-related costs for nearly two decades. The amendment also resolves a legal ambiguity by explicitly directing the revenue into the Hawaii cancer research special fund (HB441_SD2_SSCR1706_).",
  "revenue_sources": "",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "While the revenue projections remain unchanged, the fiscal implications have shifted due to new restrictions on fund usage. The full 4.0 cents per cigarette (HB441_SD2) allocation to the Hawaii cancer research special fund, which includes the projected new revenue of $4.7 million (HB441_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_) in fiscal year 2026 and $4.8 million (HB441_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_) in fiscal year 2027, is now mandated for debt service and building maintenance. This means that for the entire six-year outlook and beyond, until 2041, none of the cigarette tax revenue deposited into this special fund can be used for research or other operating expenses (HB441_SD2). The cap for the trauma system special fund remains at $7,400,000 (HB441_SD2) annually, and the community health centers and emergency medical services special funds are each still capped at $8,800,000 (HB441_SD2) per fiscal year.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The amended bill creates a direct and exclusive link between the cigarette tax revenue allocated to the cancer center and its capital-related costs. It mandates that the entire 4.0 cents per cigarette (HB441_SD2) deposited into the Hawaii cancer research special fund be used for debt service of capital expenditures and building maintenance. This dedication of funds is effective until June 30, 2041 (HB441_SD2).",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The measure now includes a long-term fiscal mandate, requiring all cigarette tax revenues allocated to the Hawaii cancer research special fund to be used exclusively for debt service and building maintenance until June 30, 2041 (HB441_SD2). This creates a significant ongoing obligation that restricts these funds from being used for research or operations for nearly two decades. This ensures the sustainability of funding for capital debt but eliminates it as a source for programmatic expenses for the foreseeable future.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The bill has been amended to resolve prior ambiguity by specifying that increased tax revenues are to be deposited directly into the Hawaii cancer research special fund (HB441_SD2_SSCR1706_). A significant change restricts the use of the entire 4.0 cents per cigarette (HB441_SD2) allocated to the fund, mandating it be used exclusively for debt service of capital expenditures and building maintenance. This restriction is set to last until June 30, 2041 (HB441_SD2), fundamentally altering the long-term use of these funds from supporting research operations to covering facility costs."
