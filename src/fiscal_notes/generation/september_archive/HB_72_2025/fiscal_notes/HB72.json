  "overview": "This bill establishes a mandatory registration requirement for pharmacy technicians with the Board of Pharmacy, beginning January 1, 2026. The measure sets a $20 biennial registration fee and clarifies that supervising registered pharmacists are responsible for the actions of registered pharmacy technicians. The bill also grants the Board of Pharmacy the authority to issue, suspend, or revoke these registrations and requires pharmacists-in-charge to report any violations.",
  "appropriations": "This measure does not contain any specific appropriation of funds. The Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs' Board of Pharmacy will be required to absorb the initial costs associated with establishing and administering the new registration program. These expenses would cover activities such as rulemaking, processing applications, issuing certificates, and managing compliance.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal projections are based on the provisions outlined in the bill, primarily the $20 biennial registration fee. Revenue calculations depend on the total number of pharmacy technicians in the State, which is currently unknown. The cost analysis assumes the Board of Pharmacy will incur administrative, personnel, and enforcement expenses to implement and manage the new program.",
  "agency_impact": "The Board of Pharmacy will experience a notable increase in its administrative and operational workload. The board must develop and adopt new rules, establish procedures for application and renewal, and manage a new database of registered technicians. This new responsibility will also require resources for handling complaints, conducting investigations, and taking disciplinary action against registrants.",
  "economic_impact": "The direct economic impact on individuals is a $20 biennial registration fee for each pharmacy technician. The measure is expected to enhance public health and safety by ensuring a minimum standard for pharmacy technicians, which could potentially reduce medication errors and associated healthcare costs. Formal registration may also contribute to the professionalization of the pharmacy technician role.",
  "policy_impact": "This bill amends Hawaii Revised Statutes Chapter 461 to create a new regulatory framework for pharmacy technicians, who were previously not registered by the State. The measure aligns Hawaii with many other states that regulate pharmacy support personnel to ensure patient safety and professional accountability. It effectively expands the jurisdiction and enforcement responsibilities of the Board of Pharmacy.",
  "revenue_sources": "The sole source of revenue identified in this bill is the $20 biennial registration fee to be paid by all pharmacy technicians. These fees will be collected by the Board of Pharmacy during initial registration and upon renewal every two years. The revenue generated is intended to offset the administrative and operational costs incurred by the board to manage the registration program.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The fiscal implications will commence in FY26, as the program begins on January 1, 2026. The Board of Pharmacy will incur one-time startup costs for rule development, database modifications, and outreach. Assuming an estimated 2,000 pharmacy technicians, the program would generate approximately $40,000 in revenue in its first year of implementation. Ongoing annual costs will be related to administration, compliance, and enforcement activities. Significant revenue collection will occur biennially during odd-numbered years, corresponding to the renewal cycle (e.g., in FY28 and FY30). This cyclical revenue stream will need to be managed against consistent annual operating costs. The adequacy of the $20 fee to cover all program expenses, including potential disciplinary proceedings, is uncertain. The Board may need to absorb some costs within its existing budget. Over the six-year period, the net fiscal impact will depend on the actual number of registrants and the volume of enforcement activity required.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "This measure will generate new operating revenue for the Board of Pharmacy through the collection of the $20 biennial registration fee. This will result in a recurring, albeit fluctuating, revenue stream tied to the biennial renewal cycle. These funds are intended to make the new regulatory program self-sustaining by covering its associated administrative costs.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "This measure is not expected to have any impact on capital expenditures. The Board of Pharmacy is anticipated to administer the new registration program using its existing facilities and equipment. Any necessary updates to the board's IT systems for managing registrant data are expected to be handled within its operational budget.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "After the initial six-year period, the program will entail ongoing fiscal obligations for the Board of Pharmacy, primarily for recurring administrative and enforcement costs. The sustainability of the program will depend on whether the revenue from the biennial registration fees is sufficient to cover these long-term operational expenses. The board may need to re-evaluate the fee structure in the future to ensure continued fiscal solvency of the program.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "No previous fiscal note was provided for comparison."
