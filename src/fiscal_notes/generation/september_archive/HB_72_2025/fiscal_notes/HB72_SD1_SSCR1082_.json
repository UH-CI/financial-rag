  "overview": "This measure requires pharmacy technicians to be registered with the Board of Pharmacy beginning January 1, 2026, establishing Hawaii as the final state to regulate this profession. It sets a biennial registration fee, defines the scope of practice for technicians and auxiliary personnel, and assigns responsibility to supervising pharmacists for the actions of technicians. The bill also imposes a duty on pharmacists-in-charge to report any violations committed by registered technicians to the board.",
  "appropriations": "This measure does not include any appropriation from the general fund. The administrative costs associated with implementing and maintaining the pharmacy technician registry are intended to be covered entirely by the registration fees collected. No specific funding is allocated for initial program setup or staffing.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal analysis is based on the statutory revenue generated from a $20 biennial registration fee as mandated in the bill. Projections assume that all practicing pharmacy technicians in the state will register, with revenue directly corresponding to the number of registrants. The fee structure is designed to offset the administrative workload incurred by the Board of Pharmacy for program management, oversight, and enforcement.",
  "agency_impact": "The Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs' Board of Pharmacy will experience an increased administrative workload to establish and manage the new registration program. Responsibilities will include developing registration procedures, processing applications and renewals, maintaining a database of registered technicians, and handling disciplinary actions. This represents a new regulatory function for the Board, requiring the allocation of existing or new administrative resources.",
  "economic_impact": "",
  "policy_impact": "This measure aligns Hawaii's pharmacy regulations with national standards by registering a previously unregulated class of healthcare workers. A key policy update in this version of the bill involves amending supervision requirements by removing the terms 'direct' and 'physically present'. This change, requested by the Board of Pharmacy, provides greater operational flexibility in pharmacy settings and harmonizes the new statute with existing administrative rules.",
  "revenue_sources": "The sole revenue source for this program is a $20 biennial registration fee to be paid by each pharmacy technician. These fees will be collected by the Board of Pharmacy. This revenue is intended to make the regulatory program self-sustaining.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The fiscal implications begin in the second half of fiscal year 2026 with the initial registration period starting January 1, 2026. This will generate an initial wave of revenue from the $20 registration fee. The Board of Pharmacy will incur initial startup costs for establishing the registration system and ongoing administrative costs for its management. Revenue will follow a biennial cycle, with peaks during renewal periods, which occur by December 31 of each odd-numbered year. The program is designed to be self-funded, with fee revenue expected to cover all operational and oversight expenses without reliance on general funds. The total fiscal impact is directly proportional to the number of pharmacy technicians in the state, which this registry will help to quantify for the first time. No new state positions are explicitly authorized by the measure.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The measure will generate new operating revenue for the state through the collection of the $20 biennial registration fee from all pharmacy technicians. This new revenue stream will be directed to the Board of Pharmacy to fund the administrative costs of the registration program. The total amount of revenue will depend on the number of technicians who register.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "No significant capital expenditures are anticipated as a result of this measure. The Board of Pharmacy is expected to utilize the existing administrative and IT infrastructure of the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs to manage the new registration program. No new facilities or major equipment purchases are identified.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "Beyond the initial six-year period, the program will have stable, recurring fiscal implications based on a self-funding model. The Board of Pharmacy will continue to incur ongoing administrative costs for registry maintenance, renewal processing, and enforcement, which will be offset by the biennial registration fee revenue. These fiscal activities will continue until the measure's sunset date of December 31, 2050.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "This fiscal note provides comprehensive new details not present in the previous version. It adds an overview of the bill and specifies the agency impact on the Board of Pharmacy. It identifies the $20 biennial registration fee as the sole revenue source and outlines a six-year fiscal projection based on this self-funding model, with no general fund appropriation. A key policy update is noted: the removal of 'direct' and 'physically present' from supervision language to provide operational flexibility. Finally, it confirms no capital expenditures are expected and outlines long-term fiscal implications until the 2050 sunset date."
