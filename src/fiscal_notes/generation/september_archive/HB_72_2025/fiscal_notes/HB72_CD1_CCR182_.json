  "overview": "This measure requires pharmacy technicians to obtain a certificate of registration from the Board of Pharmacy beginning January 1, 2026. It also imposes a duty on pharmacists-in-charge to report violations by registered technicians and clarifies that supervising pharmacists are responsible for their actions. The final version of this measure removes a previously proposed registration fee and changes its effective date to upon approval.",
  "appropriations": "This measure does not provide an appropriation to the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs (DCCA) to implement the pharmacy technician registration program. The Professional and Vocational Licensing Division will be required to absorb all administrative and operational costs associated with establishing and maintaining the registry. These costs include application processing, database management, and compliance activities.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal analysis assumes the DCCA can absorb the full cost of the new registration program without additional funding, as the bill was amended to remove the proposed registration fee. Cost projections are based on the estimated administrative workload required to process applications for the thousands of pharmacy technicians currently in the workforce. Data from existing DCCA licensing programs for similarly sized professions is used as a baseline to estimate staffing and technology resource needs.",
  "agency_impact": "The Board of Pharmacy will face a significant, unfunded increase in its administrative workload to implement the registration program by January 1, 2026. Without revenue from fees, the Board must cover all costs for staffing, IT system modifications, and enforcement from its existing operational budget. This may divert resources from the Board's other regulatory functions and potentially impact service levels across other licensed professions.",
  "economic_impact": "",
  "policy_impact": "",
  "revenue_sources": "This measure will not generate any revenue for the state. The Conference Committee amended the bill to delete a proposed $20 registration fee for pharmacy technicians. As a result, the Compliance Resolution Fund will not receive any revenue from this program to offset its administrative costs.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "Over the next six years, this measure will impose ongoing, unfunded costs on the DCCA. The primary expenditures will occur in FY26 to cover the one-time costs of setting up the registration system and processing the initial influx of applications. In subsequent years, from FY27 to FY31, the DCCA will incur recurring costs for processing new and renewal applications, maintaining the database, and managing compliance. These annual operating costs are estimated to require approximately 0.50 FTE for administrative support, totaling around $30,000 annually. Initial IT system modification costs will also be incurred in FY26. Since the registration fee was eliminated, these expenditures will be a net cost to the Compliance Resolution Fund. This fiscal liability could necessitate a future general fund appropriation if the fund cannot fully absorb the ongoing expenses. The workload is expected to stabilize after the initial registration period, with future cost increases tied mainly to negotiated salary adjustments. Without a dedicated funding mechanism, the long-term sustainability of this program within the DCCA's existing budget is a significant concern.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "This measure will have no positive impact on the state's operating revenue. The deletion of the previously proposed pharmacy technician registration fee eliminates a potential revenue stream that would have offset the program's administrative expenses. Consequently, no new operating revenues will be generated by this measure.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "This measure is not expected to have any impact on capital expenditures. The necessary modifications to the DCCA's existing professional licensing database are considered operational IT expenses. No new facilities, major equipment, or other capital investments are required to implement this registration program.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "After the initial six-year period, the state will incur ongoing annual operating costs to sustain the pharmacy technician registration program indefinitely. These costs, primarily for staffing and IT system maintenance, will represent a continuing liability against the DCCA's budget. Without a dedicated registration fee, the program will rely on the Compliance Resolution Fund or may require future general fund subsidies for its continued operation.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The most significant change from the previous fiscal analysis is the deletion of the $20 registration fee for pharmacy technicians. This amendment transforms the measure from being potentially revenue-neutral to being a net cost to the state, requiring the DCCA to absorb all administrative expenses. Consequently, sections on appropriations, revenue sources, operating revenue impact, and six-year fiscal implications have been updated to reflect these unfunded costs. Furthermore, previously blank sections, including the overview and agency impact, have been populated with specific details based on the final text of the bill."
