  "overview": "This measure is now intended for enactment, having removed the defective effective date present in the prior draft. Its purpose is to extend the deadline for the University of Hawai'i Sea Grant College Program to submit the North Shore Beach Management Plan to December 1, 2026. This extension is deemed necessary to allow for sufficient community engagement as intended by the original authorizing legislation, Act 226, SLH 2024.",
  "appropriations": "This measure does not appropriate new funds, but it extends the lapse date of funds previously appropriated under Act 226, Session Laws of Hawai'i 2024. The funds, which were set to lapse on June 30, 2025, will now be available for expenditure by the University of Hawai'i until June 30, 2026. This aligns the availability of funding with the newly extended project timeline.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The primary assumption has changed from the bill being procedurally defective to it being enacted as law. The fiscal analysis is now based on the successful extension of the expenditure period for funds appropriated by Act 226, SLH 2024. This shifts the financial impact from zero (due to lapsing funds) to a re-timing of expenditures from FY 2025 to FY 2026.",
  "agency_impact": "In contrast to the previous version, this measure provides budgetary and administrative stability for the University of Hawai'i. By extending the funding availability, it ensures the UH Sea Grant College Program has the necessary resources to complete the North Shore Beach Management Plan within the extended timeframe. This eliminates the budgetary uncertainty and potential project disruption identified in the prior fiscal note.",
  "economic_impact": "The successful completion of the North Shore Beach Management Plan is expected to provide long-term economic benefits by serving as a coastal management and adaptation model for other communities. This proactive planning can lead to future cost savings statewide by mitigating the impacts of coastal erosion and informing more resilient infrastructure decisions. The direct fiscal impact is limited to a shift in the timing of expenditures.",
  "policy_impact": "This measure is no longer a procedural vehicle for negotiation but a substantive policy action that effectively amends Act 226, SLH 2024. It reaffirms legislative intent to support proactive coastal resilience planning by aligning the project's deadline with its funding timeline. This change ensures the implementation of the original policy goal, which was stalled by the previous draft's defective date.",
  "revenue_sources": "This measure does not introduce new revenue sources. Funding for the North Shore Beach Management Plan originates from the general fund appropriation made under Act 226, SLH 2024. This bill solely addresses the expenditure timeline of those previously appropriated funds.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "This measure alters the state's financial plan by shifting an expenditure from fiscal year 2025 to fiscal year 2026. Funds appropriated by Act 226, SLH 2024, for the North Shore Beach Management Plan will not lapse on June 30, 2025, as they would have under the previous draft. Instead, the unexpended balance will be carried over for use in FY 2026, allowing the University of Hawai'i to complete the project. This represents a one-time re-timing of an existing appropriation and does not increase the overall cost of the project to the state. No other fiscal implications are anticipated over the six-year period.",

  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The most significant update is the removal of the defective effective date, transforming the bill from a non-viable measure into an effective piece of legislation. Consequently, while the previous fiscal note reported no fiscal impact because the bill was not intended to pass, this note reflects a direct fiscal impact: the extension of the lapse date for an existing appropriation from Act 226, SLH 2024. This shifts the expenditure of funds from FY 2025 to FY 2026, restoring the bill's original purpose of aligning the project's timeline with its funding."
