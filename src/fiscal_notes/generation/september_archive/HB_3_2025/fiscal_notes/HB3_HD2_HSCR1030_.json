  "overview": "House Bill 3, House Draft 2, amends the measure to not only extend the deadline for the North Shore Beach Management Plan to December 1, 2026, but also to prevent the associated appropriation from lapsing. This bill now ensures that funds appropriated under Act 226, SLH 2024, remain available until June 30, 2026. This change restores the fiscal mechanism to support the extended project timeline.",
  "appropriations": "This measure now contains a provision that extends the lapse date to June 30, 2026, for funds previously appropriated for the North Shore Beach Management Plan under Act 226, Session Laws of Hawai'i 2024. This action ensures that any unencumbered funds from the initial appropriation will not revert to the general fund at the end of FY 2025. This provision effectively makes the funds available for an additional fiscal year to align with the new project deadline.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal analysis is now based on the amended text of House Draft 2, which includes a non-lapsing provision. The primary assumption is that this measure carries a fiscal impact by allowing funds appropriated for FY 2025 to be expended in FY 2026. This contrasts with the previous analysis, which assumed no fiscal impact due to the absence of such a provision.",
  "agency_impact": "This measure now provides both administrative and budgetary benefits to the University of Hawai'i. By extending the appropriation lapse date, it resolves the budgetary uncertainty noted in the previous version and ensures funding is secure for the project's duration. This allows the university to proceed with the project's community outreach and planning phases without the risk of losing its allocated funds.",
  "economic_impact": "",
  "policy_impact": "This bill has been amended to reintroduce a significant fiscal policy component by altering the lapse date of a prior appropriation. Unlike the previous version, which was purely an administrative deadline extension, House Draft 2 now aligns fiscal policy with the project's operational needs. This ensures the original legislative intent to fund the completion of the North Shore Beach Management Plan is fulfilled.",

  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "House Draft 2 introduces fiscal implications that were absent in the previous draft. By extending the lapse date of the appropriation from Act 226, SLH 2024, to June 30, 2026, this measure ensures that any unspent funds from FY 2025 will be carried over and available for expenditure in FY 2026. This directly impacts the state's financial plan by shifting the spending authority for these specific funds into the next fiscal year. While it does not appropriate new money, it prevents the reversion of already appropriated funds to the general fund. The analysis in the previous fiscal note, which stated that funds would lapse on June 30, 2025, is no longer valid. This version of the bill restores the funding mechanism necessary to complete the project within the extended timeline. Therefore, the state's expenditure outlook for FY 2026 is now impacted by the amount of unspent funds carried over from FY 2025 for this project.",

  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The primary change from the previous fiscal note is the reinsertion of a key fiscal provision. House Draft 2 was amended to include language extending the appropriation lapse date to June 30, 2026, for funds related to the North Shore Beach Management Plan. This directly reverses the situation described for House Draft 1, which had removed the non-lapsing provision and was characterized as having no fiscal impact. Consequently, this version of the bill ensures project funding remains available through the extended deadline, restoring the bill's fiscal relevance."
