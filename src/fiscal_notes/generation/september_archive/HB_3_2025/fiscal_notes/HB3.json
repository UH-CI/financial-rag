  "overview": "This measure extends the submission deadline for the North Shore Beach Management Plan, which the University of Hawaii Sea Grant College is required to develop. Originally mandated by Act 226, Session Laws of Hawaii 2024, the extension is intended to provide the college with sufficient time to conduct thorough community engagement and outreach. The bill aims to facilitate the creation of a community-focused coastal management and adaptation plan for Oahu's north shore.",
  "appropriations": "This measure does not appropriate any funds. It solely addresses the extension of a reporting deadline and does not allocate funding for staffing, contracts, or other expenses. Any appropriations for the development of the North Shore Beach Management Plan were presumably contained in the original enabling legislation.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "As this bill carries no direct fiscal impact, no financial projections or cost estimations were calculated. The assessment is based on the procedural nature of the measure, which only adjusts a statutory deadline. Consequently, no assumptions regarding program costs, participation rates, or revenue were necessary.",
  "agency_impact": "The measure directly impacts the University of Hawaii Sea Grant College by granting it additional time to complete and submit its mandated North Shore Beach Management Plan. This extension is an administrative adjustment and is not expected to require additional staffing or resources from the university. The Department of Land and Natural Resources testified in support but experiences no direct operational changes.",
  "economic_impact": "This bill is not expected to have a direct economic impact, as it does not authorize expenditures or generate revenue. By allowing for a more comprehensive and community-vetted plan, the measure may indirectly contribute to long-term economic benefits through more effective coastal erosion management. No cost savings or performance statistics are associated with this measure.",
  "policy_impact": "This measure amends Act 226, Session Laws of Hawaii 2024, by modifying a legislative deadline. It reinforces the state's policy of using science-based, community-informed strategies to address coastal erosion. The bill supports the broader legislative goal of proactive coastal management without altering the substantive requirements of the plan itself.",
  "revenue_sources": "No revenue sources are created, identified, or utilized by this measure. The funding for the University of Hawaii Sea Grant College's work on the management plan is presumed to be covered by its existing budget or other legislative appropriations not included in this bill. The measure does not authorize any new fees, grants, or general fund allocations.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "This measure has no six-year fiscal implications. It is a non-fiscal bill that only extends a deadline and does not appropriate funds, create positions, or authorize any new expenditures. All costs associated with the creation of the North Shore Beach Management Plan are attributable to the original legislation, Act 226, Session Laws of Hawaii 2024, not this amendatory act. Therefore, there are no projected costs, staffing changes, or recurring expenses resulting from this bill over the six-year period. The financial impact is neutral, as it merely provides additional time for an existing, mandated task without altering the associated costs.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "This measure is not expected to have any impact on operating revenues. The bill does not create any new fees, taxes, or other sources of income for the state. Its purpose is purely administrative and procedural.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "There are no capital expenditure impacts associated with this measure. The bill concerns the timeline for submitting a planning document and does not authorize or fund any construction, equipment purchases, or other capital projects. No investments in facilities or infrastructure are contemplated.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "This measure creates no ongoing fiscal obligations beyond the six-year period. Its effect is limited to a one-time extension of a report deadline. Any long-term fiscal implications would arise from the implementation of the North Shore Beach Management Plan's recommendations, which are not authorized or funded by this bill.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "A previous fiscal note was not provided in the context documents. Therefore, no comparison can be made, and no updates can be summarized."
