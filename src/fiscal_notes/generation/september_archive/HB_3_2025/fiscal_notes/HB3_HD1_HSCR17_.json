  "overview": "The House Draft 1 version of the bill extends the North Shore Beach Management Plan deadline to December 1, 2026, consistent with the original intent. However, a significant procedural amendment has been made, changing the bill's effective date to July 1, 3000. This change is intended to keep the measure active for further discussion and consideration.",
  "appropriations": "This measure does not appropriate new funds, but testimony on House Draft 1 introduced a critical fiscal amendment. The University of Hawai'i proposed language to prevent the original funds appropriated by Act 226, Session Laws of Hawai'i 2024, from lapsing on June 30, 2025. This provision would ensure the existing funding remains available through the project's new timeline until June 30, 2026.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal assessment has shifted from neutral to preventative, based on the new assumption that existing project funds will lapse before the work is complete. The methodology now involves including a non-lapsing provision to preserve the previously appropriated funds through June 30, 2026. This calculation is based on testimony indicating project delays and the state's fiscal year-end deadlines.",
  "agency_impact": "The operational impact on the University of Hawaii is more significant than previously noted, as testimony revealed the project's timeline was affected by a late release of funds from the Department of Budget and Finance. The proposed non-lapsing provision is now essential to mitigate the risk of losing project funding. This turns an administrative issue into a critical budgetary one that the bill now seeks to resolve.",
  "economic_impact": "",
  "policy_impact": "This measure now incorporates two notable policy changes beyond a simple deadline extension. First, it proposes establishing a non-lapsing fund mechanism for a specific project, altering standard fiscal policy for the appropriation. Second, a committee amendment changing the effective date to July 1, 3000, modifies the bill's legislative trajectory to facilitate ongoing negotiations.",
  "revenue_sources": "",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The six-year outlook is no longer neutral, as the measure now includes a provision with direct fiscal implications for FY 2026. A proposed non-lapsing clause would carry over funding appropriated under Act 226, SLH 2024, preventing it from lapsing on June 30, 2025. This ensures the project's financial viability and allows for the expenditure of existing funds through June 30, 2026. While no new funds are added, this provision prevents the project from being defunded and is essential for its completion.",

  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The primary update from the previous fiscal note is the introduction of a non-lapsing provision in House Draft 1 to prevent appropriated funds from expiring on June 30, 2025. This change addresses a critical budgetary risk to the University of Hawai'i project, a risk exacerbated by delays stemming from the late release of funds. Additionally, the bill has been amended to carry an effective date of July 1, 3000, to ensure it remains a topic for continued legislative discussion."
