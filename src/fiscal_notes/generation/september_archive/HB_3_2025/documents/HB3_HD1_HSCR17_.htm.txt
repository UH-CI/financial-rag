State of Hawaii
Madame:
Your Committee on Water
& Land, to which was referred H.B. No. 3 entitled:
"A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO BEACH MANAGEMENT ON
THE NORTH SHORE OF OAHU,"
begs leave to report as follows:
The
purpose of this measure
is to extend
the deadline for the University of Hawai
‘
i Sea Grant College Program to submit the North Shore Beach Management
Plan to the Governor and Legislature.
Your Committee received testimony in support of this measure
from the Department of Land and Natural Resources; University of Hawai
‘
i
Sea Grant College Program; Climate Resilience Collaborative; and one
individual.
Your Committee finds that Act 226,
Session Laws of Hawaii 2024, required the University of Hawai
‘
i Sea
Grant College Program to submit a beach management plan for Oahu's North Shore
by December 1, 2025.
Your Committee
believes that extending this deadline to December 1, 2026, will better enable
the University of Hawai
‘
i Sea Grant College Program to engage
the community and develop a thorough and comprehensive beach management plan.
Your
Committee has amended this measure by changing the effective date to July 1, 3000,
to encourage further discussion.
As affirmed by the
record of votes of the members of your Committee on Water & Land that is
attached to this report, your Committee is in accord with the intent and
purpose of H.B. No. 3, as amended herein, and recommends that it pass Second
