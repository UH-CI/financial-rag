President of the Senate
Thirty-Third State Legislature
Regular Session of 2025
State of Hawaii
Sir:
Your Committee on
Higher Education, to which was referred H.B. No. 3, H.D. 2, entitled:
"A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO BEACH MANAGEMENT ON
THE NORTH SHORE OF OAHU,"
begs leave to report as follows:
The
purpose and intent of this measure is to extend the deadline for the University
of Hawaii Sea Grant College to submit the North Shore Beach Management Plan to
the Governor and Legislature.
Your Committee
received testimony in support of this measure from the Department of Land and
Natural Resources, University of Hawai
ʻ
i
System, and one individual.
Your Committee
finds that Act 226, Session Laws of Hawaii 2024, directed the University of
Hawaii Sea Grant College to develop and submit a North Shore Beach Management
Plan to the Governor and Legislature before December 1, 2025, for the purpose
of addressing coastal erosion along the north shore of Oahu.
Your Committee further finds that extending
the deadline for the Hawaii Sea Grant College to submit the North Shore Beach
Management Plan will provide the Hawaii Sea Grant College with the necessary
time to conduct much needed community engagement and outreach.
This measure will enable the Hawaii Sea Grant
College to develop a community-focused coastal management and adaptation plan
for Oahu's north shore.
Your
Committee has amended this measure by:
(1)
Inserting
an effective date of July 31, 2050, to encourage
further
discussion; and
(2)
Making a technical, nonsubstantive amendment
for the purposes of clarity and consistency.
As affirmed by the
record of votes of the members of your Committee on Higher Education that is
attached to this report, your Committee is in accord with the intent and
purpose of H.B. No. 3, H.D. 2, as amended herein, and recommends that
it pass Second Reading in the form attached hereto as H.B. No. 3,
H.D. 2, S.D. 1, and be referred to your Committee on Ways and Means.
Respectfully submitted on behalf
of the members of the Committee on Higher Education,
