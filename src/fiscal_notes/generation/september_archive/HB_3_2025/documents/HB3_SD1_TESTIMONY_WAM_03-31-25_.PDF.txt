HB 3 HD2 SD1 – RELATING TO BEACH MANAGEMENT ON THE NORTH SHORE OF OAHU 
  
Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki, and Members of the Committee: 
  
The University of Hawai‘i Sea Grant College Program (Hawai‘i Sea Grant) and the Climate 
Resilience Collaborative (CRC) support House Bill 3 HD2 SD1, which extends the deadline 
for Hawaiʻi Sea Grant to submit the North Shore Beach Management Plan (NSBMP) to the 
governor and legislature by one year to December 1, 2026.  This extension is necessary in 
order to ensure the project has sufficient time for community engagement and outreach as part 
of the NSBMP as detailed in the enacting legislation Act 226, Session of Laws of Hawaiʻi 2024.   
 
This measure, if passed, will support the NSBMP as an important coastal management, 
adaptation planning and community engagement model for other coastal communities 
struggling with coastal hazards and sea level rise and can facilitate improved community-
focused coastal planning statewide. 
  
CRC is a multi-investigator research project at the University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa focused on 
sea level rise adaptation and climate resilience. CRC is updating coastal models that project the 
impacts of sea level rise. 
  
Hawaiʻi Sea Grant’s mission is to provide integrated research, extension, and education 
activities that increase understanding and use of ocean and coastal resources of the Hawaiian 
and Pacific Islands and support the informed personal, policy, and management decisions that 
are integral to realizing this vision. Hawaiʻi Sea Grant is part of a national network of 34 
university-based programs associated with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration that promote better understanding, conservation, and use of coastal resources. 
  
CRC and Hawai‘i Sea Grant support House Bill 3 HD2 SD1, provided its adoption does not 
impact priorities as indicated in our Board of Regents Approved Budget. Thank you for the 
opportunity to testify on this measure.

In consideration of 
HOUSE BILL 3, HOUSE DRAFT 2, SENATE DRAFT 1 
 RELATING TO BEACH MANAGEMENT ON THE NORTH SHORE OF OAHU 
 
House Bill 3 Senate Draft 1 proposes to extend the deadline for the University of Hawaiʿi Sea Grant 
program to submit the North Shore Beach Management Plan to the Governor and Legislature. The 
Department of Land and Natural Resources (Department) supports the bill. 
 
The Department supports proactive adaptation planning for the impacts of coastal erosion and sea level 
rise.  The development of a dune and beach management plan follows up on the 2022 findings of the 
North Shore Coastal Resilience Working Group, which was comprised of beach advocates, community 
members, government officials, and representatives of the University of Hawaiʿi.  
 
A beach management plan for Oʿahu’s North Shore presents the opportunity to focus on the ecological 
health of an iconic beach and on the preservation of the State’s public trust resources by addressing the 
inevitability of beach migration.  The Department appreciates that the management plan will outline 
concrete adaptation and implementation strategies, and believes that the University of Hawaiʿi Sea Grant 
College Program possesses the requisite understanding of both beach processes and of human activity 
in the area to develop an effective plan.   
 
The Department understands that it will be challenging to complete the plan by the current deadline of 
December 1, 2025, and believes that extending the deadlines to December 1, 2026 presents a more 
realistic timeline. 
 
Mahalo for the opportunity to provide testimony in support of this bill.
