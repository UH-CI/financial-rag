  "overview": "This measure requires condominium association budget summaries to be self-contained and clarifies a unit owner's standing to enforce compliance. The final version, HB70 CD1, removes the controversial provision that would have shifted the burden of proof to the association in legal disputes. The bill's effective date is now upon approval, indicating its intent for immediate enactment rather than serving as a legislative vehicle.",

  "economic_impact": "By removing the provision that shifted the burden of proof to associations, this measure alleviates the primary economic concerns raised in previous testimony. The anticipated risks of increased frivolous litigation, substantial legal defense costs, and higher insurance premiums for associations have been significantly mitigated. The remaining economic impact on associations is expected to be minimal, limited to administrative adjustments for budget summary formatting.",
  "policy_impact": "The central policy change in this version is the deletion of the burden-of-proof-shifting provision, which was the main point of contention. This amendment restores the standard legal principle that the party bringing a claim is responsible for proving it. The final policy focuses on empowering unit owners by explicitly granting them legal standing to seek an injunction for compliance, without altering established legal procedures.",
  "revenue_sources": "",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "This measure continues to have no direct fiscal implications for the State of Hawaii, as it does not appropriate state funds, create a government program, or require state agency action. All compliance costs are borne by private condominium associations. A significant update from the previous version is the change in the effective date from July 1, 3000, to upon approval. This change signifies the bill is no longer a placeholder and is intended to become law, though it still imparts no cost to the state over the six-year period.",

  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The primary update is the removal of the provision that would have shifted the legal burden of proof to the condominium association in enforcement actions, which addresses the main concern raised in prior testimony. A second key change is that the bill’s effective date has been amended to “upon approval,” converting it from a legislative vehicle into a measure intended for immediate enactment."
