  "overview": "This measure has been amended to H.B. 70, H.D. 1, introducing a significant clarification to its original purpose. In addition to removing the 'good faith' defense and shifting the burden of proof, the bill now explicitly requires budget summaries to be self-contained documents. This new provision prohibits associations from referring readers to other portions of the budget or reserve study to find required information.",

  "economic_impact": "While the previous note cited benefits to owners, testimony on the current version of the bill highlights potential negative economic impacts. Opponents express concern that the provisions removing the 'good faith' defense and shifting the burden of proof could expose condominium associations to 'costly frivolous litigation.' Such legal expenses would be passed on to all unit owners, potentially increasing association fees.",
  "policy_impact": "This measure now includes a specific policy clarification amending Hawaii Revised Statutes ยง514B-148, building on the intent of Act 199 of 2023. The amendment in H.B. 70, H.D. 1, mandates that budget summaries must contain all required information without cross-referencing other documents. This change directly targets the practice of vague disclosure and strengthens the enforcement of financial transparency.",

This new draft adds a substantive clause specifying that budget summaries must contain all required information without referring readers to other sections of the budget. Additionally, the bill's effective date has been changed to July 1, 3000, to encourage further discussion on its implications, particularly the concerns about increased litigation raised in testimony."
