RE:
H.B. No. 70
H.D.
1
Honorable Nadine K. Nakamura
Speaker, House of Representatives
Thirty-Third State Legislature
Regular Session of 2025
State of Hawaii
Madame:
Your Committee on Consumer
Protection & Commerce, to which was referred H.B. No. 70 entitled:
"A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO CONDOMINIUM,"
begs leave to report as follows:
The
purpose of this measure is to:
(1)
Provide that the
defense of good faith compliance is unavailable to any condominium association
whose board adopts a budget that omits the required budget summary; and
(2)
Provide that an
association has the burden to prove substantial compliance.
Your Committee received testimony in support of this measure
from the Hawaii Legislative Action Committee of the Community Associations
Institute; Hawaii First Realty LLC; Hawaiiana Management Company, Ltd.; and six
individuals.
Your Committee received
testimony in opposition to this measure from one individual.
Your Committee received comments on this
measure from eight individuals.
Your Committee finds that the Legislature has recently passed
laws to increase transparency and accuracy with respect to condominium
association replacement reserves and reserve studies.
Your Committee further finds that additional
effort is needed to ensure that condominium associations are complying with these
new laws.
Accordingly, this measure is
intended to increase condominium association compliance with recent disclosure
requirements associated with reserve studies and budget summaries.
Your Committee has amended this measure by:
(1)
Specifying that budget summaries must contain
all required information without referring the reader to other portions of the
budget;
(2)
Changing the effective date to July 1, 3000,
to encourage further discussion; and
(3)
Making technical, nonsubstantive amendments
for the purposes of clarity, consistency, and style.
As affirmed by the
record of votes of the members of your Committee on Consumer Protection &
Commerce that is attached to this report, your Committee is in accord with the
intent and purpose of H.B. No. 70, as amended herein, and recommends that it pass
Second Reading in the form attached hereto as H.B. No. 70, H.D. 1, and be
referred to your Committee on Judiciary & Hawaiian Affairs.
Respectfully
submitted on behalf of the members of the Committee on Consumer Protection
& Commerce,
