  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The primary update corrects the composition of the appropriation increase. The new total is reached by adding eight claims totaling $1,285,077.67 to a base of twenty-three claims, not by adding ten claims as previously noted. While the final appropriation total of $7,854,458.74 for thirty-one claims is unchanged, the testimony clarifies the specific eight claims and their costs, and corrects the starting point of the bill's claim count and value."
