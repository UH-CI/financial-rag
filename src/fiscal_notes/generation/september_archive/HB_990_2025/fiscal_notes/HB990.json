  "overview": "House Bill 990 HD1 is an appropriations measure to satisfy various legal claims against the State of Hawaii, its officers, and its employees. The bill authorizes payments for judgments, settlements, overpayment of taxes, refunds, and other liabilities. The appropriations cover multiple state departments and are designated for specific named individuals, firms, and corporations for the fiscal year 2024-2025.",
  "appropriations": "The bill appropriates a total of $5,664,734.22 for fiscal year 2024-2025. This includes $4,324,734.22 from general revenues for claims involving various departments, $1,250,000 from the state highway fund for Department of Transportation claims, and $90,000 from judiciary funds for a claim against the Judiciary. These funds are designated for payment to specific claimants to resolve legal cases.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The financial projections in this bill are not based on estimations but on specific, itemized amounts required to satisfy existing legal judgments and settlement agreements. The methodology involves aggregating the exact dollar amounts from court-ordered judgments and negotiated settlements detailed in the bill. The data source for each appropriation is the specific civil case number and claimant identified within the legislative text.",
  "agency_impact": "The bill directs the Department of the Attorney General, the Department of Transportation, and the Judiciary to expend the appropriated funds to settle the specified claims. The primary administrative impact involves these agencies processing payments upon the approval of the attorney general, as stipulated. This is a recurring administrative function for claims bills and does not require new permanent staffing or significant operational changes.",
  "economic_impact": "The primary economic effect of this measure is the direct payment to individuals and entities who have claims against the state, satisfying the state's legal and financial liabilities. This action provides financial resolution for the claimants and concludes legal disputes. There are no anticipated broader economic impacts, such as job creation or cost savings from program efficiencies.",
  "policy_impact": "This bill represents a routine and necessary legislative function to authorize the payment of legal claims against the state, fulfilling its obligations under law. It does not introduce new policy, amend existing statutes, or create new programs. The measure ensures the state adheres to legal settlements and judgments, maintaining the integrity of the legal process.",
  "revenue_sources": "The appropriations are sourced from three distinct state funds. A total of $4,324,734.22 is drawn from the state's general revenues. An additional $1,250,000 is sourced from the state highway fund, and $90,000 is appropriated from judiciary funds.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The fiscal implications of this bill are confined to fiscal year 2024-2025, with a total appropriation of $5,664,734.22 to settle specific, non-recurring legal claims. The funding consists of a one-time expenditure from three sources: general revenues ($4,324,734.22), the state highway fund ($1,250,000), and judiciary funds ($90,000). These payments address claims against multiple departments, including the Departments of Education, Defense, and Land and Natural Resources. Since these are one-time settlement payments, they do not create any recurring costs or establish ongoing programs. The bill does not authorize any new positions or changes in staffing levels. All unexpended and unencumbered balances from these appropriations will lapse on June 30, 2026. Therefore, there are no projected costs or fiscal implications stemming directly from this bill in the subsequent five years. While the state will face new claims in the future, the appropriations in this specific act are fully resolved within the specified timeframe.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "This measure makes appropriations from existing state funds to pay for legal claims. It does not introduce any new taxes, fees, or other revenue-generating mechanisms. Therefore, the bill has no direct impact on the state's operating revenues.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The appropriations detailed in this bill are solely for the purpose of satisfying legal judgments and settlements. No funds are allocated for capital projects, such as the construction of facilities, procurement of equipment, or investment in technology infrastructure. Consequently, the bill has no capital expenditure impact.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "This act provides one-time appropriations for claims to be paid in fiscal year 2024-2025, with funds lapsing on June 30, 2026. The payments are for specific, non-recurring legal settlements and judgments. As such, there are no ongoing fiscal obligations, annual operating costs, or other financial implications from this bill that would extend beyond the initial appropriation period.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "No previous fiscal note was provided in the source documents. Therefore, a comparison cannot be made."
