RE:
H.B. No. 990
H.D. 2
S.D. 1
Honorable Ronald D. Kouchi
President of the Senate
Thirty-Third State Legislature
Regular Session of 2025
State of Hawaii
Sir:
Your Committee on
Judiciary, to which was referred H.B. No. 990, H.D. 2, entitled:
"A BILL FOR AN ACT MAKING APPROPRIATIONS FOR CLAIMS
AGAINST THE STATE, ITS OFFICERS, OR ITS EMPLOYEES,"
begs leave to report as follows:
The
purpose and intent of this measure is to appropriate moneys to satisfy various
claims against the State, its officers, or its employees, including claims for
judgments against the State, settlements, and other miscellaneous claims.
Your Committee
received testimony in support of this measure from the Department of the
Attorney General, Department of Transportation, Department of Education, and
one individual.
Your Committee
finds that timely passage of this measure will minimize the State's obligation
to pay interest on the amounts owed by the State.
Your Committee further finds that the written
testimony submitted by the Department of the Attorney General requests the inclusion
of funds to cover two additional claims that have been resolved since this
measure was introduced.
Your Committee has
amended this measure by:
(1)
Correcting the description of the
claims for Billy Peter v. Anne E. Lopez; and Child Evangelism Fellowship of
Hawaii, Inc. v. Hawaii State Department of Education; to indicate that the
claims were resolved by judgment, rather than settlement;
(2)
Adding
funding to cover a miscellaneous claim of $514.00 for the reissuance of an
outdated check that was misplaced or lost;
(3)
Adding $70,000.00
for the settlement of Lisa Ann
Daguro v. State of Hawaii;
(4)
Changing
the
effective date to April 23, 2057,
to
facilitate further discussion on the measure; and
(5)
Making
technical nonsubstantive amendments for the purposes of clarity and style.
As affirmed by the
record of votes of the members of your Committee on Judiciary that is attached
to this report, your Committee is in accord with the intent and purpose of H.B.
No. 990, H.D. 2, as amended herein, and recommends that it pass Second
Reading in the form attached hereto as H.B. No. 990, H.D. 2,
S.D. 1, and be referred to your Committee on Ways and Means.
Respectfully submitted on behalf
of the members of the Committee on Judiciary,
