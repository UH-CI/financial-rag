  "overview": "This measure, HB300 HD1, appropriates funds for the executive branch's operating and capital improvement budget for FY 2025-2027, reflecting adjustments from the House Committee on Finance. In response to economic warnings from the University of Hawaii Economic Research Organization (UHERO) about potential recession and federal disruptions, the bill prioritizes core and safety net programs. A key component of this version is a provision to deposit $200,000,000 into the Emergency and Budget Reserve Fund to enhance the state's fiscal flexibility.",
  "appropriations": "The House Draft (HD1) appropriates operating funds totaling $20,484,862,473 (all funds) and $10,668,359,711 (general funds) for fiscal year 2025-2026. For fiscal year 2026-2027, appropriations are $20,216,604,470 (all funds) and $10,519,050,655 (general funds). The capital improvement budget includes $1,453,490,000 in general obligation bond funds for FY 2025-2026 and $446,559,000 for FY 2026-2027, reflecting a different set of priorities from the previous draft.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The financial projections in this version are heavily influenced by new economic warnings and potential federal policy shifts. Specifically, the University of Hawaii Economic Research Organization (UHERO) issued a warning on February 28, 2025, about the risk of recession due to federal disruptions, including potential layoffs and spending cuts. This methodology also accounts for a U.S. House of Representatives budget resolution proposing a potential $2 trillion cut in federal spending impacting safety net programs like Medicaid and SNAP.",
  "agency_impact": "This draft shifts focus to bolstering agencies responsible for managing federal funds and providing safety net services. It adds five positions in FY27 to the Office of Federal Awards Management to prepare for federal policy changes. Additionally, it provides funding for twenty-one positions to support certified community behavioral health clinic certifications across the state, impacting community mental health centers on Oahu, Maui, Hawaii, and Kauai.",
  "economic_impact": "The measure's primary economic goal is to mitigate the risk of recession as forecasted by UHERO, which warned of a potential loss of over 2,000 local jobs due to federal disruptions. A key strategy is the appropriation of $200,000,000 in FY26 for deposit into the Emergency and Budget Reserve Fund, creating a fiscal buffer against economic downturns and federal spending cuts. The budget also provides sustained funding for core homeless services, including $3,750,000 annually for both the Housing First and Rapid Re-Housing programs to address housing instability.",
  "policy_impact": "This draft shifts state policy toward fiscal preparedness and strengthening the social safety net in response to external economic threats. A significant policy change is the focus on building reserves rather than extensive new program creation. Key policy implementations include providing $20,990,000 annually for summer school, $1,700,000 annually for family planning services, and $605,000 annually for Family Resource Centers to support vulnerable populations.",
  "revenue_sources": "While the revenue sources remain the same, the financial outlook has been updated based on a February 28, 2025, warning from the University of Hawaii Economic Research Organization (UHERO). UHERO's forecast suggests that federal disruptions, including potential layoffs, threaten Hawaii's economic growth and could lead to a recession. This more pessimistic projection for the general fund, which relies on state tax collections, is a key driver for the fiscally cautious approach taken in this version of the budget.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The House Draft establishes significant new multi-year fiscal obligations while preparing for economic uncertainty. A major non-recurring item is the $200,000,000 deposit into the Emergency and Budget Reserve Fund in FY26. It also creates large, recurring commitments in the healthcare sector, including appropriations for Hawaii Health Systems Corporations totaling $80,545,000 in FY26 and $69,597,400 in FY27, and for Maui Health System totaling $12,000,000 in FY26 and $6,000,000 in FY27. Furthermore, it sustains increased reimbursement rates for medical professional services with an annual appropriation of $29,455,181 and provides $13,000,000 annually for locum tenens contracts at the Hawaii State Hospital, embedding these costs into the state's long-term financial plan.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "This draft adjusts capital expenditure priorities, authorizing $1,453,490,000 in general obligation bond funds in FY 2026 and $446,559,000 in FY 2027. This represents a decrease in FY26 but an increase in FY27 compared to the previous version. Testimonies highlight continued strong support for affordable housing infusions into the Rental Housing Revolving Fund and Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund, as well as significant investments in university infrastructure and replacement of schools like the West Maui Elementary School.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "By funding major healthcare initiatives like increased Medicaid reimbursements and subsidies for Hawaii Health Systems Corporation for the full biennium, this draft creates more definite ongoing fiscal obligations beyond the six-year horizon. Unlike the previous draft's strategy of funding many new programs for only one year, this version entrenches these core service costs into the state's financial baseline. This will require sustained revenue to support these programs in future biennia, alongside growing debt service from capital projects.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "This fiscal note for HB300 HD1 reflects significant changes from the Senate's version (SD1). General fund appropriations are now higher in FY26 at $10.67 billion (vs. $10.43B) but lower in FY27 at $10.52 billion (vs. $10.42B). A primary driver for the House Draft is a new, more urgent economic forecast from UHERO warning of a potential recession, leading to a major strategic shift: the appropriation of $200 million to the Emergency and Budget Reserve Fund. Programmatically, the focus has moved to reinforcing core and safety net programs, with significant multi-year funding for health systems (HHSC, Maui Health) and sustaining Medicaid provider reimbursements, in contrast to the prior draft's tendency to fund new initiatives for only one year."
