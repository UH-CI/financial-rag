  "overview": "This measure, HB300 SD1, reflects a significant strategic shift from the previous version by rejecting the proposed $200,000,000 deposit into the Emergency and Budget Reserve Fund. Instead, it redirects resources to cash-fund $262,200,000 in capital improvement projects as a direct economic stimulus in response to a more pessimistic March 12, 2025, revenue forecast from the Council on Revenues. The bill also implements a more aggressive reduction of long-term vacant positions and restores funding for several key programs that were cut in the House Draft.",
  "appropriations": "The Senate Draft (SD1) appropriates operating funds totaling $19,930,242,350 (all funds) and $10,436,542,543 (general funds) for fiscal year 2025-2026, and $19,735,840,017 (all funds) and $10,421,715,049 (general funds) for fiscal year 2026-2027. The capital improvement budget appropriates $1,556,332,000 in general obligation bond funds for FY 2025-2026 and $339,507,000 for FY 2026-2027, supplemented by a new cash-funding strategy.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "This budget is based on the March 12, 2025, Council on Revenues forecast, which further lowered revenue projections for FY26 and FY27. A key methodological change is the rejection of the Emergency and Budget Reserve Fund deposit, with the committee report citing the Governor's past vetoes of similar appropriations as a rationale for redirecting the funds to cash-funded capital projects. The methodology also funds most new programs for only one fiscal year to provide flexibility amidst ongoing economic uncertainty and potential federal spending cuts.",
  "agency_impact": "This version implements a significant, widespread reduction of long-term vacant positions across state agencies, eliminating over 500 permanent and 150 temporary positions to generate nearly $50,000,000 in annual savings. Conversely, it restores funding and positions that were previously cut, including for the Office of Wellness and Resilience's State of Well-Being Project (8.00 FTE and $876,000), the Hawaii Community Development Authority's 99-year leasehold program (1.00 FTE and $100,000), and public charter school teacher differentials ($465,000).",
  "economic_impact": "The primary economic stimulus strategy has changed from building reserves to direct investment in the construction sector. This draft allocates $262,200,000 in general funds for cash-funded capital improvement projects to provide a near-term economic boost. It also restores the $49,500,000 special fund ceiling increase for the New Aloha Stadium Entertainment District, allowing that project to proceed and avoiding delays that could jeopardize prior state investments.",
  "policy_impact": "This measure reverses the previous draft's policy of bolstering the emergency reserve fund, establishing a new policy of using cash for capital projects as a direct economic stimulus. It also institutes a policy of funding most new programs for a single fiscal year (FY26) to maintain long-term fiscal flexibility, in contrast to the prior version's multi-year commitments. Furthermore, it restores funding for key Senate priorities that had been cut, including $2,000,000 for irrigation systems to support local farmers.",
  "revenue_sources": "The revenue outlook has been updated based on the March 12, 2025, Council on Revenues forecast, which projected further decreases in general fund tax revenues of $213,280,000 for FY26 and $218,612,000 for FY27 compared to the January 2025 forecast. This more pessimistic projection is a primary driver for the Senate's strategy of funding new programs for only one year and using cash for capital projects to avoid increasing long-term debt service.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The six-year fiscal impact is deliberately limited by the new strategy of funding most new programs for fiscal year 2026 only, providing greater fiscal flexibility for the 2027 legislative session. This approach avoids locking in significant new recurring costs for FY27 and beyond, deferring decisions on program continuation. Additionally, the aggressive reduction of over 500 long-term vacant positions lowers the state's baseline personnel costs, reducing projected future obligations.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "This draft includes a major strategic change by appropriating $262,200,000 in general funds (cash) for capital projects, in addition to authorizing $1,556,332,000 in general obligation bond funds for FY26. Key capital projects highlighted in this version include $52,000,000 for repair and maintenance of the Hawaii Convention Center, $6,070,000 for a Tropical Agricultural Technology Center in Hilo, and $22,076,000 for a state post-harvest facility.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The fiscal implications beyond the six-year period are intentionally reduced compared to the previous version. By funding most new initiatives for only one year, this budget avoids establishing numerous new, permanent programs that would carry ongoing costs into future biennia. The decision to continue these programs and their long-term fiscal impact is deferred to future legislatures.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "This fiscal note for HB300 SD1 marks a significant departure from the House Draft (HD1). The Senate Draft reverses the House's core strategy by rejecting the $200 million Emergency and Budget Reserve Fund deposit and instead using $262.2 million in cash for capital projects as an economic stimulus. Based on a newer, more pessimistic March 12, 2025 revenue forecast, the SD1 has lower overall appropriations, with general fund operating totals of $10.44 billion for FY26 (down from $10.67B). A key policy change is to fund most new programs for only one year to maintain flexibility, and it aggressively cuts over 500 long-term vacant positions. Finally, the SD1 restores several key programs reduced in the House, including funding for irrigation systems, the Aloha Stadium project, charter school teacher differentials, and the Office of Wellness and Resilience."
