  "overview": "This measure, HB300 H.D. 1 S.D. 1, appropriates funds for the executive branch's operating and capital improvement budget for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027. It incorporates the base budget from previous legislation, adds adjustments for fixed costs and collective bargaining, and reflects amendments made by the House and Senate. The Senate's draft focuses on strategic investments aligned with its priorities while exercising fiscal caution due to economic uncertainty.",
  "appropriations": "The Senate Draft (SD1) appropriates operating funds totaling $19,930,242,350 (all funds) and $10,436,542,543 (general funds) for fiscal year 2025-2026. For fiscal year 2026-2027, it appropriates $19,735,840,017 (all funds) and $10,421,715,049 (general funds). The capital improvement budget includes $1,556,332,000 in general obligation bond funds for FY 2025-2026 and $339,507,000 for FY 2026-2027, with additional funding from other sources.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "Financial projections are based on the executive base budget from Act 164, SLH 2023, with adjustments for fixed costs like debt service, retirement, and health benefits as detailed in Finance Memorandum No. 24-17. The methodology includes incorporating Council on Revenues forecasts for general fund revenue projections, which were recently revised downward. Cost savings were calculated by identifying and eliminating long-term vacant positions based on departmental lists and Finance Memorandum No. 24-10.",
  "agency_impact": "The measure impacts agencies primarily through the elimination of over 500 permanent and 150 temporary long-term vacant positions across all funding sources, resulting in significant savings. However, it also adds numerous new positions to support Senate priorities in areas like education, healthcare, and biosecurity. The bill restores funding and positions for several departments that were cut in the House draft, including the Department of Agriculture and the Office of Wellness and Resilience, thereby preventing reductions in force.",
  "economic_impact": "The budget aims to provide a near-term economic stimulus by cash-funding certain capital improvement projects, which is intended to boost the construction industry. Amidst economic uncertainty from potential federal funding cuts, the measure makes strategic investments in agriculture, housing, and workforce development to foster economic resilience. For example, restoring $2 million for irrigation systems is intended to keep water rates affordable for local farmers and support agricultural production.",
  "policy_impact": "This measure implements the Senate Majority's 2025 legislative priorities, focusing on education, housing, environmental sustainability, and agricultural innovation. It modifies the state's financial plan by strategically reducing long-term vacant positions and using general funds for capital projects to provide fiscal flexibility. The budget's cautious approach, such as funding many new programs for only one year, reflects a policy of preparing for potential economic downturns and federal policy shifts.",
  "revenue_sources": "The primary funding source for the operating budget is the state general fund, which is supported by tax revenues projected by the Council on Revenues. The Council recently lowered its forecast, projecting a revenue contraction in FY 2026, which influenced the Senate's conservative budget approach. Other revenue sources detailed in the budget include special funds, federal funds, and general obligation bond funds for capital improvement projects.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The six-year outlook is shaped by significant fixed costs and new obligations, alongside reduced revenue projections. Major general fund obligations include the Maui wildfire settlement ($400M in FY26, $407.5M in FY27), collective bargaining costs ($135.2M in FY26, $161.2M in FY27), and annually recurring fixed costs for debt service, retirement, and health benefits exceeding $3.8 billion. The Council on Revenues' forecast through FY 2031 shows modest growth after a projected contraction in FY 2026. To maintain fiscal flexibility, the Senate funded most new programs for only FY 2026, requiring future legislative action for continuation. Savings are generated from eliminating over 150 general-funded vacant positions, saving nearly $15 million annually. The capital budget commits over $1.9 billion in general obligation bonds over the biennium, adding to future debt service payments. These factors create a challenging fiscal environment requiring careful management over the next several years.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The measure is primarily an appropriations bill and does not directly generate operating revenue. However, its framework is heavily influenced by anticipated operating revenues, specifically the state's general fund tax collections. The Council on Revenues' downward revision of its forecast, predicting a decrease in revenues for FY 2026, is a critical factor driving the Senate's fiscally conservative appropriations.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The bill authorizes significant capital expenditures, appropriating $1.56 billion in general obligation bond funds in FY 2026 and $339.5 million in FY 2027. Major investments are targeted towards education facility repairs ($195M), affordable housing projects (over $318M), and university student housing (over $247M). A key strategy is the use of general funds for certain capital projects to stimulate the economy without increasing long-term debt.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "Beyond the six-year planning horizon, the state will face ongoing fiscal obligations from the programs and capital projects funded in this budget. Recurring costs for debt service, employee retirement, and health benefits will continue to be significant and are expected to grow. The long-term sustainability of new programs is uncertain, as many are funded for only one year and will require re-authorization and appropriation in a potentially constrained revenue environment.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "No previous fiscal note was provided in the source documents. Therefore, a comparison of updates cannot be made."
