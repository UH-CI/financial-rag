  "overview": "This measure, HB300 CD1, represents the final conference agreement on the state budget, shifting from the Senate's specific strategy of cash-funding capital projects to a broader approach that incorporates executive requests and provides significant new funding for critical government services. The final budget prioritizes major investments in education, healthcare, and public safety. Key highlights include substantial funding for the Department of Education's deferred maintenance, major financial support for the Hawaii Health Systems Corporation (HHSC), and a significant expansion of the state's biosecurity programs.",
  "appropriations": "The final conference draft appropriates operating funds totaling $10,593,637,391 from general funds for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $10,637,871,235 for fiscal year 2026-2027. For capital improvements, the measure appropriates $1,428,063,000 in general obligation bond funds for FY 2025-2026 and $423,022,000 for FY 2026-2027. These figures represent a notable increase in general fund operating appropriations compared to the previous version, while the FY26 capital improvement bond appropriation has been reduced.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The final budget was developed through a conference committee process that reconciled the House and Senate versions while incorporating adjustments requested by the executive branch. Unlike the previous draft's singular focus on cash-funding capital projects as a stimulus, this version's methodology involved targeted funding additions to address specific, high-priority needs across government. Major new programs and positions are funded for the full biennium, indicating a shift away from the previous draft's more cautious single-year funding approach for new initiatives.",
  "agency_impact": "This version significantly expands agency operations and staffing, in contrast to the previous draft's emphasis on reducing vacant positions. Notable additions include $26,649,462 and 44 positions for the Department of Agriculture's biosecurity efforts and $248,257,800 for HHSC regions to address operational shortfalls. The Department of Education receives an additional $150,000,000 for deferred maintenance projects, and the Department of Law Enforcement is funded for a new Fireworks Enforcement Section with $5,234,951 and 8 positions.",
  "economic_impact": "The economic impact of this measure is driven by direct, large-scale investments in core public services and infrastructure rather than a specific cash-for-CIP stimulus strategy. The $150,000,000 for school deferred maintenance will generate construction activity, while the $248,257,800 infusion into HHSC aims to stabilize the state's healthcare system. Furthermore, significant funding for workforce readiness programs in education ($7,550,000) and healthcare loan repayments ($30,000,000) is intended to address critical labor shortages.",
  "policy_impact": "This final version solidifies a policy of direct investment to shore up critical government functions, moving away from the previous draft's policy of using cash for CIP as the primary fiscal strategy. It makes significant, multi-year commitments to address systemic issues in healthcare, education infrastructure, and biosecurity, establishing these as top legislative priorities. The addition of numerous permanent positions across various departments signals a policy shift toward rebuilding government capacity, rather than the previous version's focus on downsizing through position elimination.",
  "revenue_sources": "",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The six-year fiscal implications are substantially greater than in the previous version due to the addition of numerous permanent positions and significant recurring program costs. By funding initiatives like the expanded biosecurity program (44 FTEs) and DOCARE academy (21 FTEs) for the full biennium, this budget increases the state's baseline personnel and operational costs for future years. This approach contrasts with the prior draft's strategy of limiting long-term commitments by funding new programs for only a single fiscal year.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "This version modifies the state's capital expenditure plan by reducing the amount of new general obligation bonds authorized for FY26 to $1,428,063,000 and removing the large cash infusion for CIP that was central to the previous draft. Instead, it prioritizes bond funding for specific large-scale projects, including a significant $150,000,000 allocation for deferred maintenance at the Department of Education. Other key capital projects include funding for a new Central Maui elementary and middle school ($35,000,000) and various improvements to HHSC facilities.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The long-term fiscal obligations are significantly increased in this final version, reversing the previous draft's attempt to minimize future commitments. The creation of dozens of new, permanent positions in agriculture, law enforcement, and health, combined with substantial recurring funding for HHSC and other programs, will elevate the state's baseline operating budget well beyond the six-year planning period. This establishes a higher level of sustained state spending necessary to maintain these expanded services.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The final conference draft, HB300 CD1, marks a strategic evolution from the Senate Draft (SD1), shifting from a narrow focus on cash-funded CIP stimulus to a comprehensive budget that funds a wide array of critical services and executive priorities. General fund operating appropriations are significantly higher, increasing to $10.59 billion for FY26 from the SD1's $10.44 billion, while FY26 GO bond authorizations are reduced to $1.43 billion from $1.56 billion. Most notably, the CD1 adds a substantial number of permanent positions and recurring funds across agencies—particularly for Agriculture biosecurity, HHSC operations, and DOE deferred maintenance—thereby increasing long-term fiscal commitments, in contrast to the SD1's more cautious approach of single-year funding and vacant position reductions."
