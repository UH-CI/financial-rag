TESTIMONY ON HOUSE BILL 300, HOUSE DRAFT 1 
RELATING TO THE STATE BUDGET.

Senate Committee on Ways and Means 
Senator Donovan M. Dela Cruz, Chair  
Senator Sharon Y. Moriwaki, Vice Chair

State Capitol, Conference Room 211 & Videoconference 
 
Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki, and Members of the Committee: 
The Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (DCR) supports House Bill 
(HB) 300, House Draft (HD), 1, which appropriates funds for the operating budget and 
capital improvement program (CIP) for fiscal years (FY) 2025-2026 and 2026-2027. 
DCR is grateful for the support of the House Committee on Finance for funding 
its FY 2025-2026 additional operating budget request of $5,274,288 and FY 2026-2027 
of $4,547,494.  In total, DCR’s request for FY 2025-2026 of 2615.60 permanent 
positions, 43.00 temporary positions, and $320,555,674 for all means of financing; and 
for FY 2026-2027 of 2615.60 permanent positions, 43.00 temporary positions, and 
$319,828,880 for all means of financing was supported. 
However, DCR seeks the support of the Committee on Senate Ways and Means 
to fund the following CIP requests that were not funded in HB 300, HD1: 
FY2025-2026  
 $20M - Facility wide security perimeter fencing repairs and improvements.  
HB300, HD1 funded only $5M of the request; 
 

 
 
HB300, HD1 Relating to the State Budget 
Senate Committee on Ways and Means 
March 18, 2025

 $23M – General lump sum CIP, statewide; 
 
 $5M – Facility wide deferred maintenance for both years of the Fiscal 
Biennium;  
 
 $10M – 10-Year Departmental Master Plan.  DCR’s Departmental Master 
Plan was last updated in 2003; and 
 
 $4M – Renovation of the Maui Community Correctional Center.  
 
Due to the conditions of its aging correctional facilities, DCR needs the CIP 
funding resources requested in HB 300, to address the critical health and safety issues 
currently impacting on the security and operations of those in DCR’s custody and care, 
and its dedicated staff, at the correctional facilities.  
Thank you for the opportunity to present this testimony in support of HB 300, HD 1.

TESTIMONY 
OF

STATE PROCUREMENT OFFICE 
 
TO THE SENATE COMMITTEE 
ON 
WAYS AND MEANS 
MARCH 18, 2025, 10:00 A.M. 
 
HOUSE BILL 300, HD1 
RELATING TO THE STATE BUDGET 
 
Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki, and members of the committee, thank you for the 
opportunity to submit testimony on House Bill 300, HD1. The State Procurement Office (SPO) 
supports this bill, which will appropriate/allocate funds for the Executive Branch for fiscal years 
2026 and 2027.  This is to highlight our budget requests that go beyond the recurring funds.   
 
AGS 240 SEQ 100-001: Add funds to extend Small Business Initiative for SPO (AGS 240) 
The SPO requests an appropriation of funds for personnel: our Small Business Procurement 
Coordinator.  Pursuant to Act 168, SLH 2022, the SPO was appropriated funds to establish a 
small business initiative program. The main purpose of the initiative is to develop rules, policies, 
and strategies to ensure that small businesses are able to effectively participate in contracting 
opportunities with the State.  The Small Business Procurement Coordinator position was filled 
on February 3, 2025.  Since then, we have been making progress on developing the small 
business initiative program. 
 
AGS 244 SEQ 100-001: Add funds for Surplus Property Management (AGS 244) 
The SPO is submitting two requests to raise the Surplus Property Management program’s 
revolving fund ceiling.  Because the program is special funded, raising the fund ceiling will not 
impact the General Fund.  Through business operations, we believe that the program can 
shoulder the additional costs.   
 
• 
Raising Ceiling for Fringe Benefits 
Raising the fund ceiling is to help cover the fringe benefits for the program.  In the past 
few fiscal years, the Surplus Property Management program has encountered a shortfall 
in fringe benefits, requiring the transfer of operational funds to cover personnel costs.  
The amount requested is based on the composite rate from FM 24-09. 

Testimony of the State Procurement Office 
House Bill 300, HD1 
 
 
 
Senate Committee on Ways and Means 
March 18, 2025 
Page 2 
 
 
• 
Raising Ceiling for Personnel Expenses 
Raising the fund ceiling for personnel expenses will allow the program to reclassify two 
positions within the Surplus Property Management program.  The two positions that are 
to be reclassified perform duties that are extraneous to their current class and position 
description to ensure compliance with stringent Federal and State regulations, in 
addition to meeting the needs of its stakeholders.  
 
Organizations that rely on federal surplus property provided through the Surplus 
Property Office will be significantly impacted by impending Federal budget cuts. 
Reduced access to essential resources and equipment from Federal programs may 
hinder their ability to fulfil their respective mission across the state.  In response, the 
Surplus Property Office and its staff are anticipated to intensify its efforts to support 
eligible nonprofit organizations in Hawaii.   
 
The SPO needs to recognize the additional work that is required to help make the 
program successful.  Furthermore, we find that the salary range for the program in 
Hawaii greatly lags behind counterparts in other states.  Of the 38 states where the 
program’s management position is filled and the salary is published, Hawaii ranks 30th.  
The increase will put the salary at about the median of this group.  This increase will help 
Hawaii maintain a competitive pay for the responsibilities with other states for similar 
programs.   
 
Thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony on this measure.

TESTIMONY OF 
THE DEPARTMENT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 
KA ‘OIHANA O KA LOIO KUHINA 
THIRTY-THIRD LEGISLATURE, 2025 
 
 
ON THE FOLLOWING MEASURE: 
H.B. NO. 300, H.D. 1, RELATING TO THE STATE BUDGET. 
 
BEFORE THE: 
SENATE COMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS 
 
DATE: 
Tuesday, March 18, 2025 
TIME:  10:00 a.m. 
LOCATION: State Capitol, Room 211 
TESTIFIER(S): 
Anne E. Lopez, Attorney General, or  
Brenden B. Kinoshita, Administrative Services Manager 
 
 
Chair Dela Cruz and Members of the Committee:
The Department of the Attorney General (Department) strongly supports this bill, 
specifically, those appropriations within the budget that provide funding for the 
continued operations of the Department for fiscal biennium 2025-2027.  The 
Department has no objections to the adjustments made by the House in House Draft 1 
of the bill. 
Included in the Department’s budget for fiscal years 2026 and 2027 are critical 
requests to convert the funding of four currently-staffed Investigator positions in the 
Investigations Division’s Sex Offender Registration Unit from federal funds to general 
funds; salary adjustments for deputy attorneys general to recruit and retain talented 
attorneys and maintain the Department’s competitive position against similar public and 
private sector employers; and an increase to the Department’s line-item budget for 
litigation expenses given the continuing trend of rising litigation costs.  The 
Department’s budget also includes a number of housekeeping adjustments, such as 
trade-off/transfers and increased fringe costs for non-general funded programs to better 
align the Department’s budget with its programmatic and organizational structure. 
Finally, the Department’s budget includes a request to relocate and house the 
physical servers of the Hawai‘i Criminal Justice Data Center due to the 
decommissioning of the current State-operated Kalanimoku location, as well as 
requests from the administratively attached Hawai‘i Correctional System Oversight

Commission (HCSOC).  For the HCSOC’s budget requests, the Department defers to

We thank the Committee for allowing the Department to provide testimony and 
respectfully ask the Committee to pass this bill with the requested appropriations.

SENATOR DONOVAN M. DELA CRUZ, CHAIR 
SENATOR SHARON Y. MORIWAKI, VICE CHAIR 
 
Testimony of Caroline Cadirao 
Director, Executive Office on Aging 
Attached Agency to the Department of Health 
 
Hearing: Tuesday, March 18, 2025, 10:00 A.M., Conference Room 211   
EOA Position: The Executive Office on Aging (EOA), an attached agency to the Department of 
1 
Health (DOH) strongly supports HB300 HD1, which defines EOA’s operating budget as 
2 
outlined in the Program Appropriations, HTH 904, Page 30, Item No. 25.  
3 
Fiscal Implications:  Appropriates funds for the EOA’s operating budget for fiscal year 2025-
4 
2026 and for fiscal year 2026-2027.  
5 
Purpose and Justification: EOA’s operating budget includes the following additions:  
6 
1) Establish one (1) full-time permanent Program Specialist V within the State Health Insurance 
7 
Assistance Program (SHIP); 2) Transfer three (3) new full-time civil service positions from 
8 
temporary to permanent within the Senior Medicare Patrol (SMP), and 3) Convert the Long-
9 
Term Care Planner VI position from temporary to permanent. 
10 

HB300 HD1 
Page 2 of 3 
 
 
1) Establish one (1) full-time permanent staff position (Program Specialist V), within the 
1 
State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP);  
2 
The additional one (1) FTE, permanent staff is needed to increase access to enrollment 
3 
assistance for programs that can offset medical and prescription drug costs such as premiums, 
4 
deductibles, copayments, coinsurance, or lifetime late enrollment penalties that are deducted 
5 
directly from social security benefits.  Without this position, less Medicare beneficiaries will 
6 
be reached through education, outreach, and one to one Medicare counseling.  
7 
2) Transfer three (3) new full-time civil service positions from temporary to permanent 
8 
positions (Program Specialist V, Program Specialist IV, and Program Specialist III) 
9 
within the Senior Medicare Patrol (SMP);  
10 
Act 250, passed in the 2023 legislative session, established three (3) full-time staff positions 
11 
to protect kūpuna from frauds and scams.  Converting these three (3) temporary, civil service 
12 
positions to permanent, will provide timely, reliable, and accurate services.  SMP provides a 
13 
statewide toll-free helpline, provides 1:1 counseling and referrals and conducts community 
14 
outreach to underserved groups and communities to expand access and assistance for 
15 
Medicare, Medicaid, and other health related scams, fraud, or abuse.  If the positions are not 
16 
converted to permanent, EOA will be unable to maintain the education, outreach and 
17 
counseling.  The number of older adults who will be victimized will rise proportionately with 
18 
the growing aging population in Hawai’i.  
19 
3) Convert the Long-Term Care Planner VI position from temporary to permanent.      
20 
Note in the HD1 budget worksheet on page 504 this position is listed as Planner IV SR 
21 

HB300 HD1 
Page 3 of 3 
 
 
26.  However, EOA is requesting the conversion from temporary to permanent of the 
1 
current position of Planner VI. 
2 
Act 159, passed in the 2024 legislative session, provides for a Long-Term Care (LTC) 
3 
Planner to address the serious nature of LTC in Hawai‘i.  This Act will ensure kupuna have 
4 
the opportunity for optimal health and well-being through a comprehensive Long-Term Care 
5 
plan for Hawai‘i.  Converting the 1.0 FTE position from temporary to permanent, will enable 
6 
EOA to move the LTC plan forward, increasing awareness for a sustainable system of care 
7 
throughout Hawai‘i.  Without a dedicated staff person to support the planning, policy, and 
8 
advocacy to move forward the strategies and objectives, EOA will be delayed in addressing 
9 
this critical issue for the community.  Additionally, this can impact the costs of care and a 
10 
reduction in options for home and community-based services.  
11 
We appreciate your consideration of this bill. 
12 
Recommendation:  EOA strongly supports this measure and respectfully requests your 
13 
consideration of EOA’s operating budget.   
14 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify.

funding will be requested in the next biennium budget; 
• $500,000 to address deferred repair and maintenance at public libraries and support 
offices statewide; 
• $500,000 in FY26 and $250,000 in FY27 to increase efficiency in the circulation of over 3 
million physical items statewide;

and 
• $3m in planning and design for a new Kapaa Public Library.

and Means: 
 
The DLIR strongly supports the HD1 of HB 300, which includes the following budget 
requests critical to our department: 
 
• Funding for the maintenance and operation of the Disability Compensation 
Division’s (DCD) Electronic Case Management System, including associated 
licenses and cloud services. The funding provides the means for injured workers, 
employers, attorneys, and physicians to electronically file and access workers’ 
compensation and temporary disability cases in a secured cloud environment. To 
date, there’s been $16.7M invested in the project and without funding the 
Division would need to reinstitute paper-based claims and shut down the public 
portal.  
 
• $126,000 for two Human Resources Specialist IV positions to implement the 
Holo delegation and Act 186 hiring programs. The DLIR currently has 73 
designated classes of work delegated by DHRD, these two positions will facilitate 
implementing Act 186 and facilitate participation in Holo delegation.  
 
• Two Labor Law Enforcement Specialist positions and funds to address the 
backlog of labor law complaints investigated by the Wage Standards Division.

• Two DCD Enforcement Specialist IV positions (1 on Oahu, 1 in Hilo) and funds to 
help ensure that eligible employees receive the medical and economic protection 
guaranteed by workers’ compensation, temporary disability insurance, and 
prepaid health care laws. 
 
• Changing the method of financing for two positions in the Unemployment 
Insurance Division without additional funding. This change in funding will ensure 
stable, long-term support for the Unemployment Insurance Division’s critical 
equity and access initiatives. 
 
• Funding for the Hawai‘i Labor Relations Board Staff Attorney to implement the 
criteria and procedures established by Act 143 for the creation of new bargaining 
units. Act 143 (SLH, 2024) provided funding for FY2024-25 and this request 
funds that temporary position through the biennium as Act 143 expires on July 1, 
2027. 
 
• Two positions for the Office of Community Services (OCS) to provide more direct 
client assistance in the Immigration Resource Centers. Act 207 (SLH, 2024) 
provided funding for two FTE to OCS to create an Immigrant Services and 
Access Unit, however, the funding is limited to the appropriation made by the Act 
and non-recurring. 
 
• Pursuant to G.M. 4, $720,000 in FY25-26 and $445,000 in FY26-27 to address 
Hawaii Retirement Savings Program’s startup costs including consultant 
contracts, marketing and communications, and legal, audit, and insurance in 
order to establish baseline information for program administration; create a 
financial model to determine fees necessary to support program costs; evaluate 
and determine investment design and policy statement; program administration 
services; and participant marketing, financial education, and disclosures.

In Support of 
HB 300, HD1 
 
RELATING TO THE STATE BUDGET. 
 
 
Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki, and Members of the Committee, the 
Hawai‘i State Energy Office (HSEO) offers comments with suggested amendments 
supporting the intent of HB 300, HD1 which appropriates funds for the operating and 
capital improvement budget of the Executive Branch for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 
2026-2027. 
We respectfully seek your support of HSEO’s BED 120 suggested budget 
requests to ensure HSEO is appropriately staffed and funded to carry out its statutory 
duties under HRS 196-71 in fulfilling the State’s top priorities to a secure, resilient, clean 
energy economy.   
 
HSEO requests the Committee’s consideration for amending the following: 
Adjustment: SEQ#100-001 – Add Funds for Hawai‘i State Energy Office 
Impact Statement: This request is an increase in payroll for the salaries of six 
mission critical positions in the HSEO.  We appreciate the House approval to increase 
the base budget for five positions.  However, we are requesting your consideration for 
funds in the amount of $20,432 for PN 124584 be included.  An increase in the base 
budget is needed to attract qualified candidates to fill the position.  This position is 

Hawaii State Energy Office

currently vacant.  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the mean salary for an 
economist in Hawai‘i is $100,000.  The current budgeted salary is $77,521.  This 
increase would raise the base budget to $98,000.  To attract and retain a qualified 
employee an increase in the budgeted salary is necessary to be competitive in the 
current market. 
 
Adjustment: SEQ#101-001 – Personal Services for Temp Chief Energy 
Officer 
Impact Statement: This request will appropriately fund the position of the Chief 
Energy Officer, established by the Legislature under Act 122, SLH 2019.  Additional 
funds are needed to cover a payroll shortfall from the salary amount currently provided 
for the position that places the agency’s statutory head among the lower half of paid 
positions in the agency at $80,625.  The requested salary adjustment will realign the 
budget with actual costs and allow the program to utilize OCE funds now covering the 
shortfall to support critical operational expenses. 
HSEO respectfully requests your favorable consideration of these requests. 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify.

Re:

Aloha, Honorable Chair Dela Cruz, Vice-chair Moriwaki, and members of the Senate Ways and 
Means committee: 
 
The Early Learning Board (ELB) formulates statewide policy relating to early learning, as well as 
directing the Executive Office on Early Learning (EOEL).   
 
The Early Learning Board supports HB 300 HD1 which includes funding for 50 additional EOEL 
Pre-kindergarten classrooms across the state for the next biennium.  This is a priority for the 
Early Learning Board.  There is also strong support from DOE principals and the general 
public.   
 
We understand the uncertainty of these financial times and are hoping for the best.   
 
Mahalo for your consideration and support of this request. 
 
Sincerely,

HB 300 HD1 – RELATING TO THE STATE BUDGET 
Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki, and Members of the Committee: 
Thank you for the opportunity to present testimony today.  The University of 
Hawai‘i (UH) supports HB 300 HD1, Relating to the State Budget.  This bill 
appropriates funds for the operating and capital improvement budget of the Executive 
Branch for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027. 
 
Many departments in state government are going to be financially impacted given 
projected reductions in federal funding support for a number of programs and 
personnel.  The UH is looking at a number of programs that have been impacted or are 
at risk, which represent reductions in public services to our students, organizations, and 
our broader state community through research and other grant support.  Given the 
dynamic situation, the UH’s budget request does not include any additional funding in 
these shortfall areas. 
 
The following table provides the items included in UH’s portion of the House Draft of the 
operating budget.  Items in red were denoted as non-recurring by the House:

Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki and members of the Committee. 
 
 
 
The Stadium Authority offers comments on HB300, HD1. We respectfully request 
that the $49.5M ceiling increase request for the Stadium Development Special Fund 
(SDSF) for FY2026 in House Bill 300, be reinserted in accordance with the governor’s 
administrative budget request.  
 
 
The ceiling increase would allow the Stadium Authority (BED180/SA) to allot and 
expend the funds appropriated in Act 248, Session Laws of Hawaii 2022, and 
authorized by proviso 17.3, which permitted the deposit of a $49.5M appropriation into 
the SDSF. The ceiling increase would also enable the Stadium Authority to expend 
funds toward advancing the New Aloha Stadium Entertainment District (NASED) 
project. Failure to secure this increase could delay the execution of the stadium 
development and operation agreement and other NASED project documents.    
 
 
Additionally, the SDSF ceiling increase would allow the Stadium Authority to 
move the NASED project forward and ensure the project’s long-term sustainability and 
positive impact on Hawaii’s communities.   
 
 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify.

March 18, 2025 at 10:00 a.m. 
State Capitol, Room 211 
In consideration of 
H.B. 300 HD1 
RELATING TO THE STATE BUDGET. 
Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki, and members of the Committee.   
HHFDC supports HB 300 HD1, which appropriates funds for the operating and capital 
improvement budget of the Executive Branch for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-
2027. 
HHFDC requests the committee's consideration of the following for the biennium (unless 
otherwise noted): 
$20,000,000 in FY 2026 and $20,000,000 in FY 2027 (MOF: C) for BED 160 Dwelling 
Unit Revolving Fund Infusion, Statewide 
 
The Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund (DURF) may be used for the acquisition of real 
property; development and construction of residential, commercial, and industrial 
properties; interim and permanent loans to developers; development of regional 
infrastructure; and all things necessary to carry out the purposes of HHFDC’s Housing 
Development Program, including administrative expenses.  
 
The $40,000,000 infusion will provide additional financing resources to support the 
development of workforce and affordable housing statewide, as well as infrastructure 
improvements, including but not limited to, interim loans for affordable housing projects, 
infrastructure improvements in Transient-Oriented Development areas that support 
affordable housing projects, rehabilitating infrastructure in the Villages of Kapolei for 
dedication to the City, development of a new potable water system for the Waiahole 

 
 
 
Valley community, continued development of the Leialii (Maui) master planned 
community, and planning and development of the Iwilei Master Plan.  
 
This infusion also includes rehabilitating the Front Street Apartments and other 
infrastructure needs on Maui. 
 
$50,000,000 in FY 2026 and $50,000,000 in FY 2027 (MOF: C) for BED 160 Cash 
Infusion for Rental Housing Revolving Fund, Statewide 
 
The Rental Housing Revolving Fund (RHRF) provides loans or grants for development, 
pre-development, construction, acquisition, preservation, and substantial rehabilitation 
of rental housing units. The state has a severe shortage of housing, and the $100 
million infusion is needed to continue to provide gap financing for the development of 
affordable rental housing projects.  The need for RHRF is based on the demand 
exhibited during our 2025 (FY2026) financing application round. There were 31 
applications for RHRF financing in the current round for a total requested amount of 
$1.19 billion. The trends experienced in the current economic environment of rising 
interest rates in the private capital market, rising cost of labor, construction materials, 
and insurance have increased the need for additional financing as the 
developer equity gap increases.  
 
$75,000,000 in FY 2026 and $75,000,000 in FY2027 (MOF: C) for BED 160 Cash 
Infusion for Tier II Rental Housing Revolving Fund, Statewide 
 
RHRF Tier II provides financing for workforce rental projects targeting households 
earning between 60% and 140% of the AMI. This population includes households that 
earn too much to qualify for Low-Income Housing Tax Credit projects but 
not enough to buy their own homes. This group represents our workforce, such as 
teachers, firefighters, and nurses, and affordable housing for this group has been 
identified as a priority for the State. This group has been identified as the largest 
segment leaving Hawaii due to the lack of affordable housing. The $150 million is critical 
to address the housing needs of this population as quickly as possible. 
 
BUDGET ADJUSTMENTS:  
 
HHFDC requests ceiling increases by $356,200 for FY 2026 and $185,200 for FY 2027 
for Other Current Expenses (OCE), with revolving funds as the means of financing 
(MOF W):  
 
$73,600 for FY 2026 and $73,600 for FY 2027 for Maui Travel 
As the lead agency for the housing recovery support function on Maui, HHFDC staff will 
be required to take frequent trips to Maui for meetings with Maui officials, site visits, and 
planning and development meetings. 
 
$231,000 for FY 2026 and $60,000 in FY 2027 for Financing Application Software 
The Housing Finance branch of HHFDC reviews applications from developers and 
facilitates funding and tax credit awards to affordable housing projects. This software 
would reduce staff’s time spent to input, score, and analyze data and produce reports 

 
 
 
that are currently done manually. This may make it possible to hold additional funding 
application rounds if funds and/or resources are available.  
 
The $171,000 ceiling increase in FY 2026 is for non-recurring financing application 
software implementation costs including loading all the historical data into the software 
program. The $60,000 recurring cost for FY2027 is for maintenance, support, and 
updates of the software application which we expect will increase with inflation in 
subsequent years.  
 
$21,600 for FY 2026 and $21,600 for FY 2027 for Artificial Intelligence Licenses 
Hawaii is in a housing shortage crisis along with an ever-increasing workload, HHFDC 
is looking to implement cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) technology to increase the 
efficiency and effectiveness of staff's time and productivity. Copilot licenses for Microsoft 
365 will help boost employee productivity by automating redundant tasks, assisting with 
document and email drafting, and providing quick insights using natural language 
queries (GPT). Its integration with Microsoft SharePoint can enhance collaboration by 
making it easier to find relevant documents, track changes, and maintain version control 
across HHFDC's branches and sections. It will also help to build up HHFDC's model to 
create a learning, query-able AI that is specific to HHFDC's core functions; Copilot can 
generate summaries of SharePoint documents, facilitate project updates, and ensure 
that everyone is aligned.  
 
$30,000 for FY 2026 and $30,000 for FY 2027 for Staff Training 
Investing in staff training is essential to equip employees with the latest knowledge and 
skills necessary to perform their roles.  Attending training workshops and conferences 
for new programs and best practices enable staff to stay abreast with updates on 
housing finance and development programs (i.e., financing strategies, development 
practices, funding opportunities, Internal Revenue tax codes, Fair Housing).  Staff 
training is also critical for employee retention and succession planning.  
 
Amendment of Section 7 of Act 164, Session Laws of Hawaii 2023 
 
HHFDC supports the amendment indicated in item A-17 in section 11(1) of the bill. By 
deleting "public Prekindergarten Classroom," private preschools can be located at the 
Hale O Laie site.  
 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify on this bill.

In consideration of 
HB300 HD1, RELATING TO THE STATE BUDGET 
 
  
Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki, and the members of the committee:  
  
The purpose of HB300 HD1 is to appropriate funds for the operating and capital 
improvement budget of the Executive Branch for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-
2027.   
 
The Department of Human Resources Development (HRD) strongly supports HB300 
HD1 as it relates to our biennium budget requests.

Description of Request 
Payroll Adjustments. Funding is required to address: 
1) Collective Bargaining Adjustments. Salaries for filled positions have increased over 
time, while the budgeted salaries for vacant positions have not kept pace. 
2) Advancement and retention of employees. Without adequate funding, HRD will be 
unable to adjust salaries as employees advance in their classification series, which 
will significantly hinder career progression.   
3) Addressing Salary Disparities for Excluded Managerial (EM) positions to align with 
the middle of the collective bargaining schedule, which will better position HRD to 
retain qualified managers and prevent turnover. 
4) Minimizing Turnover and Addressing Workforce Attrition, amid a significant number 
of Executive branch employees becoming eligible for retirement. 
5) Sustaining Recruitment Success.

Description of Request 
HRD SAAS Cost Increases. HRD's Software as a Service (SAAS) applications costs 
have increased dramatically. SAAS systems are rising at approximately $70-80K per 
year. Costs have eclipsed HRD's operating budget. This funding request is essential.  
If not adequately addressed, HRD will not have sufficient funds for operations. 
 
The request will support increasing costs for HRD's NeoGov (recruitment, 
onboarding), Human Resources Management System (HRMS), and Adobe Learning 
Manager (ALM for training content). These systems serve as the enterprise-wide 
foundation for the HR and payroll operations of the Executive Branch.

Description of Request 
Add 2.00 Positions and Funds for PTO (Employee Records and Transactions). The 
requested 2.00 FTE HRMS Analyst positions are currently temporary, exempt from 
civil service, and funded with ARPA funds. Without these positions, the maintenance 
of the centralized, comprehensive employee information system within the Executive 
Branch will remain inefficient and staff will continue to be inundated with mundane 
tasks.  Most importantly, we would jeopardize timely and accurate processing of 
employees' pay, benefits and employment security. The HRMS Analyst positions are 
working to review legacy processes and provide recommendations to maximize the 
efficiency and effectiveness of HR components within HIP, as well as explore other 
opportunities to integrate systems. These positions will also play an essential role in 
the EFS and ERP projects.

Description of Request 
Add 6.00 Positions and Funds for ESD (Employee Staffing Division Recruitment and 
Outreach). The request to institutionalize the 6.00 ESD FTEs as permanent positions 
will ensure progress made in recruiting efforts remain intact. 5.00 of the 6.00 positions 
are currently exempt from civil service, temporary, and funded with ARPA funds. This 
team has enhanced recruitment and certification capabilities within ESD, enabling the 
State to more effectively meet its workforce needs. Without this funding and 
resources, the ESD remains constrained in its ability to attract and retain top-tier 
talent, affecting the State's ability to deliver critical public services effectively. 
 
1.00 (Human Resources Technician VI) of the 6.00 positions will support the 
Certification section within ESD. Certification provides front-end and back-end support 
for all requested recruitments for civil service vacancies. Currently, there are only 1.00 
professional and 3.00 paraprofessional staff managing over 1,500 requisitions 
annually.

Many classes and minimum qualification requirements are outdated, hampering 
recruitment and retention efforts. Jobs have changed over time and so have State 
services. If not funded, the State will fall further behind, and will continue to struggle

   Governor Josh Green on Healthcare Innovation  
 
Regarding HB300 HD1— RELATING TO THE STATE BUDGET 
 
Position: SUPPORT with COMMENTS 
——————————  
Testimony: 
 
 
SHPDA is evolving to fulfill its 50-year-old statutory authority as a 
healthcare oversight agency for the state. That authority, created 1974, was 
never implemented, but the vision remains in statute. Today the state of 
Hawai`i lacks necessary oversight for healthcare and healthcare policy.   
 
 
While DCCA houses the Insurance Commissioner to assure fiscal 
solvency of insurers and also oversees professional licensing; DHS manages 
the Med-QUEST (Medicaid) program; DOH manages public health, 
institutional mental health, and emergency medical services; Corrections 
and Rehabilitation manages their own health care services; and the UH 
manages JABSOM and health professions training; the state lacks a 
coordinating agency for healthcare policy, health system reform, and overall 
assurance of universal access to high-quality and affordable healthcare for 
all. At the Governor’s request, SHPDA is building this missing capacity for 
Hawaii and our public and private healthcare sector. This lack of healthcare 
oversight has also been observed as requiring our state’s attention by 
Senator Dela Cruz, Director Kenny Fink, me, and various others. 
 
    
  Data is needed to fulfill this vision and to accurately monitor 
population health status, identify and propose means of closing gaps in 
healthcare in terms of access to care, preventable morbidity and mortality, 

HB300 HD1: testimony of SHPDA 3-18-2025, continued. 
 
2 
 
and disparities in healthcare outcomes across Hawaii’s diverse population 
and geography.  
 
 
That currently missing data will begin to become available in 2025 
through the All-Payer Claims Database (APCD), created by legislative 
mandates in 2026 and 2019 requiring all health and dental insurers submit 
all of their insurance claims to SHPDA. The SHPDA APCD, which is a solid 
partnership with the UH and Med-QUEST, already has de-identified, privacy-
assured healthcare data under management for over 1 million citizens, and 
we aim to have the de-identified data for the entire state by 2027. The All-
Payer Claims Database (APCD) will give the state the ability to monitor 
population health, access to healthcare, and healthcare outcomes in 
comparison to other states and the nation. It is a big step forward; but it will 
need specialized staff to effectively mine the data, and then develop means 
to employ findings in collaboration with Hawaii’s impressive healthcare 
sector, to more robustly improve healthcare outcomes and population health 
at affordable costs.  
 
 
SHPDA and the DHS Med-QUEST Division (MQD) also successfully 
applied for and were one of only 6 states to receive the Centers for Medicare 
and Medicaid Innovation Center’s (CMS/CMMI) “AHEAD” grant (All-Payer 
Health Efficiency Approaches and Development). Despite the DOGE cuts 
occurring in Washington, AHEAD is the only major CMS/CMMI grant to be 
safe and fully funded.  
 
 
AHEAD funds will provide MQD and SHPDA with about $2.35 million 
per year for 5 years through 2030 for planning, data acquisition, actuarial 
costs through consultants, totaling about $12 million to organize the grant’s 
ambitious goals of improving population health at lower costs through 
innovation. However, in addition, if all the hospitals, physicians, and clinics 
statewide participate, they will be eligible for new CMS incentive payments 
which could total over $200 million annually over 8 years through 2035 (or 
between $1-2 billion through 2035). If the grant is successfully 
implemented, it will transform Hawaii’s healthcare system and increase 
spending on primary care by 100% to improve healthcare access.  
 
 
SHPDA’s budget requests in HB300 HD1 reflect these challenges, 
which is occurring in stages. These include: 
 
1. Digitalizing SHPDA’s 100s of thousands of paper records from 50 years 
of Certificate of Need (CON) applications and deliberations, which 
occupy (in many, many file cabinets) two-thirds of the space in our 
small office in the Keoni Ana building attached to the Capitol Office 
Tower.  

HB300 HD1: testimony of SHPDA 3-18-2025, continued.

o This process is almost completed, having been funded from our 
special fund (created by CON filing fees) with FY 2024 funds. 
o Once completed in 1-2 months, we will have cleared space in our 
office to bring in SHPDA’s need for additional staff to fulfill our 
expanded mission, including two federally funded staff focused 
on the AHEAD grant. 
   
2. Renovating SHPDA’s office to accommodate new staff and a necessary 
conference room to accommodate SHPDA’s many advisory council 
meetings, some of which are in-person, and all of which require 
multiple staff to interface with statewide Governor-appointed advisory 
council members, as well as for CON hearings. This is possible now 
that the digitalization process is complete. The budget requests: 
o A one-year one-time special fund ceiling increase to use 
Corrections Industries to renovate our office for the first time in 
50 years, and to accommodate: 
o A new Administrative Officer (FY ’26 budget); 
o Two AHEAD federally-funded staff who are in the hiring process 
now; 
o 3 new staff needed to mine the APCD database and the 
aforementioned purposes in FYs 26-27. 
o The much needed conference room for statewide advisory 
council and CON hearings.  
 
3. Assisting SHPDA with administrative tasks needed to support our 
mission. We need help with procurement, HR, and improve and track 
our administrative and budgetary requests: 
o We requested an Administrative Officer for these purposes which 
remains in our budget. We very much need this position! 
   
4. Preparing to mine the APCD data to systematically improve Hawaii’s 
healthcare outcomes and population health, and to support the data 
needs of the AHEAD grant. However, this is needed also for many 
other healthcare needs not covered by the AHEAD grant, such as 
improving healthcare outcomes in cancer, heart disease, diabetes, 
and many other causes of disease preventable diseases; for 
identifying and providing coverage for the remaining 50,000 or more 
uninsured persons in Hawai`i; for streamlining the problematic health 
insurance “prior authorization” process; for successfully convincing 
CONGRESS with credible data to fix the flawed formula for Medicare 
reimbursement in Hawai`i for our hospitals and providers who are 
becoming increasingly non-viable; and finally for using technology 
and innovation to improve access to care with telemedicine and new 
delivery models to help address our severe workforce shortage of 

HB300 HD1: testimony of SHPDA 3-18-2025, continued. 
 
4 
 
health professionals. To successfully accomplish these important 
goals, we will need : 
o 3 new staff in epidemiology, healthcare informatics, and health 
statistics. We requested one physician informaticist-
epidemiologist in this year’s budget, but it was cut. We will be 
back to make this happen.    
 
5. Securing consultant funds to fix the serious under-reimbursement 
problem we face from Medicare, which is adversely affecting the 
viability of our hospitals, physicians, clinics, and other providers 
statewide. This is critically important. We need to document the 
damage to healthcare this funding shortage is creating. Hawai`i has 
the lowest per capita reimbursement from Medicare of states, and the 
highest cost of living and housing. Hawai`i’s per capita Medicare 
reimbursement is about $9,500, while the national average is around 
12,500. We would need an additional $1 billion annually to be at the 
national average, which is only 0.1% of Medicare spending. It is a 
resolvable problem; but we need to create accurate data to reflect the 
damage being done, AND to document with solid data that we could 
create more than $1 billion in federal savings to pay for that increase 
in funding by reducing unnecessary hospitalizations, emergency 
department visits, and serious preventable complications of chronic 
medical illnesses. Once a data-supported strategy is developed by 
top-notch consultants with respect in the current Congress, our 
hospitals and insurers will themselves fund the lobbying effort needed 
in 2027 to effect this essential change. To accomplish this SHPDA 
requested $405,000 in the budget. This was reduced to $250,000. We 
need this consultant funding as follows for FY 26: 
o SHPDA’s request for about $250,000 should please remain intact 
in this budget.

RE: HB 300 HD 1 - RELATING TO THE STATE BUDGET
Dear Chair Dela Cruz and members of the Committee,
The Special Education Advisory Council (SEAC), Hawaii’s State 
Advisory Panel under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, 
supports HB 300 HD 1 relating to EDN 150 - funding for Special 
Education. This bill appropriates funds for the operating and capital 
improvement budget of the Executive Branch for fiscal years
2025-2026 and 2026-2027.
SEAC received a budget briefing on February 14th by the Department’s 
Budget Branch and agrees with the priorities of the Office of Student
Support Services for additional funding in the following areas:
• $10 million each year for contracted skilled nursing services,
• $1.8 million in FY 27 for 20 licensed Mental Health
Interventionists  to support students at risk of suicide and needing
intensive educational settings, and
• $1.7 million for surveys and electronic platforms to capture data
critical to managing student mental health.
While general education has seen a gradual decline in enrollment 
for K-12 students since the beginning of the pandemic, the special 
education population has remained stable.  These students are struggling 
to make up learning losses related to distance learning necessitated by 
the pandemic and often are experiencing higher rates of anxiety than 
their non disabled peers.   We ask your Committee to appropriate the 
necessary funds to enable them to achieve academic and socio-
emotional growth.

Before the Senate Committee on  
WAYS AND MEANS 
 
Tuesday, March 18, 2025  
10:00 AM  
State Capitol, Conference Room 211 
 
 In consideration of  
HOUSE BILL 300 HOUSE DRAFT 1 
RELATING TO THE STATE BUDGET 
 
House Bill 300 House Draft 1appropriates funds for the operating and capital improvement 
budget of the Executive Branch for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027. The Kaho‘olawe 
Island Reserve Commission (KIRC) supports this measure. 
The Kaho‘olawe Island Reserve Commission respectfully request the addition of Capitol 
Improvement Project (CIP) funding for its Project A01A: Kaho‘olawe Restoration and 
Resilience Center, Maui (Phase 2), LNR908 in the amount of $4,250,00 (Planning: $350,000; 
Design: $3,000,000; Construction: $900,000). 
The KIRC has the unique opportunity to build the Kaho‘olawe Restoration and Resilience Center 
at its base yard property located adjacent to the Kīhei Small Boat Harbor.  This project will not 
only consolidate and provide a single KIRC office on Maui but will also tell the story of 
Kaho‘olawe’s cultural significance, its ecological devastation and the efforts to restore and 
demonstrate our communities’ resiliency to heal the damages of the past. Additionally, this 
facility will also create a revenue generating venue in the South Kīhei corridor to assist in Maui’s 
economic recovery, generate additional tax revenues and create income opportunities for the 
KIRC to fund restoration efforts on Kaho‘olawe.  
Phase 2 of the project is to develop the detailed drawings and plans necessary to build this 
project.  This includes final construction drawings and specifications, planning and development 
of exhibits and archive storage, final planning, design for office layout, and final design of the 
building infrastructure (HVAC, network). 
Additionally, this request includes construction efforts to expand the current boathouse to 
include a larger concrete pad and two additional covered wings for additional boat storage as 
well as creating a small educational pavilion and restroom facilities adjacent to the current 
boathouse.

SUBJECT:  
House Bill 300, House Draft 1, Relating to the State Budget 
 
 
 
Hearing: Tuesday, March 18, 2025; 10:00am 
 
 
 
State Capitol, Room 211 
 
Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki, and Members of the Committee: 
 
The Hawaii Correctional System Oversight Commission (HCSOC, the Commission) supports 
House Bill 300, House Draft 1, Relating to the State Budget, as the modest funding increase is 
essential for sustaining and expanding the Commission’s vital oversight work. Through the 
Attorney General’s Office, this bill allocates an increase of $196,863 for FY26 and $271,445 for 
FY27, allowing the Commission to continue fulfilling its statutory mandate and enhance its critical 
oversight efforts. 
 
In 2019, the Hawaii legislature found that, “independent oversight of the State’s correctional 
system ensures transparency, supports safe conditions for employees, inmates, and detainees, and 
provides positive reform towards a rehabilitative and therapeutic correctional system.” This led to 
the passage of Act 179 of 2019 and the establishment of Chapter 353L in the Hawaii Revised 
Statutes, which tasks the Commission with monitoring the correctional system, investigating 
complaints, setting inmate population limits, and ensuring the effectiveness of offender reentry 
programs. Since its inception in 2020, the Commission has made significant strides, particularly 
with the hiring of dedicated staff and the initiation of vital oversight activities in 2022. 
 
To date, the Commission has conducted over 65 investigative visits to correctional facilities, issued 
more than 55 public reports, and held over 70 public meetings. These efforts have resulted in over 
100 recommendations to the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (DCR), a crucial 
partner in advancing a more rehabilitative and therapeutic corrections system. The implementation 
of these recommendations has already led to tangible improvements, including: 
- 
Ensuring compliance with federal standards, such as proper access to courts, adequate 
bedframes and bunkbeds, appropriate clothing and bedding, access to outdoor recreation, 
and provision of menstrual pads. 

Testimony of the Hawaii Correctional System Oversight Commission 
House Bill 300, House Draft 1, Relating to the State Budget

- 
Creating a more therapeutic environment for individuals on suicide watch by painting and 
reconfiguring cells. 
- 
Restoring contact visits to strengthen family ties, which is critical for successful reentry. 
- 
Removing the monetary eligibility requirement for furlough participation at all furlough 
sites, expanding access to rehabilitation opportunities. 
 
To build upon these successes and fully meet its statutory obligations, the Commission is 
respectfully requesting funding for two full-time positions including a Prison Oversight Specialist 
to expand investigative capacity and to fulfill §353L-4(b)(1), and a Research and Policy Associate 
to support data-driven reforms and fulfill §353L-4. Additionally, the Commission is requesting 
funding for a case management system to organize, track, and monitor all complaints and 
recommendations. Lastly, the Commission is requesting additional funding for inter-island and 
mainland correctional facility travel to fulfill §353L-4(b)(1), memberships and conferences to 
fulfill §353L-7, and general operational expenses. 
 
Oversight is imperative to safeguarding the rights and well-being of incarcerated individuals, staff 
members who work in the correctional facilities, and the broader community. Furthermore, by 
ensuring compliance with state and federal regulations, robust oversight reduces the risk of costly 
litigation, ultimately saving taxpayer dollars while fostering a safer and more rehabilitative 
correctional system. Therefore, when evaluating the state of corrections and the allocation of funds 
towards correctional, reentry, and rehabilitative initiatives in Hawaii, the Hawaii Correctional 
System Oversight Commission stands as a pivotal investment for driving systemic transformation.  
 
For all the reasons stated above, the Oversight Commission supports HB300 as it will increase 
funding for the Hawaii Correctional System Oversight Commission, enabling the Commission to 
sustain its crucial efforts. Should you have additional questions, the Oversight Coordinator, 
Christin Johnson, can be reached at 808-900-2200 or at christin.m.johnson@hawaii.gov.  
 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify.

Dear Senator Dela Cruz, and Committee Members: 
 
SUBJECT: HB 300 HD1 RELATING TO THE STATE BUDGET   
The Hawaii State Council on Developmental Disabilities supports HB300 HD1, which 
Appropriates funds for the operating and capital improvement budget of the Executive Branch 
for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027. Specifically,

This appropriation amount in HB300 HD1 provides the Council with current staffing and 
fiscal resources in order to implement 2022-2026 State Plan activities in the areas of 
community supports; health and children and youth; public awareness, education and training; 
transition and employment; and self-advocacy/self-determination.  
 
Activities include policy development, policy implementation, and analysis; informing 
and educating policymakers about Intellectual/Developmental Disabilities (I/DD); establishing 

Senator Dela Cruz 
March 18, 2025 
HB300 HD1 
Page 2 of 2 
 
networks and coalitions on specific issues and concerns relating to developmental disabilities; 
conducting legislative advocacy training; providing leadership training; demonstrating new 
approaches to services and supports; fostering interagency collaboration and communication; 
coordinating and sponsoring the annual Day at the Capitol, transition events, and neighbor 
island and Oahu legislative forums, etc.  
Without appropriate resources and support systems for individuals with intellectual or 
developmental disabilities (I/DD), the consequences can be significant for individuals, families, 
and the broader community. With limited access to community-based services, more 
individuals may be placed in institutional settings rather than supported in living independently, 
leading to increased costs and limiting personal growth and inclusion. A lack of employment 
and educational opportunities creates further barriers to independence, increasing reliance on 
caregivers and social services, which places additional strain on families. In some cases, 
family members may be forced to leave the workforce to provide care, impacting household 
stability and reducing the overall workforce. 
Additionally, gaps in essential services such as healthcare, housing, and transportation 
can lead to higher rates of emergency medical care, hospitalizations, and long-term 
dependency on costly care systems. The absence of adequate support also impacts the 
workforce shortages in healthcare and caregiving, as more individuals would require 
assistance without enough trained professionals to meet the demand. Without strong programs 
and services that promote inclusion, independence, and accessibility, individuals with I/DD are 
at risk of being left behind, leading to cycles of dependency rather than empowerment. 
Ensuring that essential services remain in place benefits not just individuals with I/DD, but 
strengthens the entire community by promoting a more inclusive and sustainable future for all.  
Thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony in support of HB300 HD1, relating to 
the specific budget items noted below. 
Sincerely, 
 
Daintry Bartoldus 
Executive Administrator

Senator Sharon Moriwaki, Vice Chair  
Senate Committee on Ways and Means 
                  
March 18, 2025, at 10:00 a.m., Room Number 211 
 
Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki, and Members of the Senate Committee on Ways 
and Means:  
 
The Office of Wellness and Resilience (OWR) in the Governor’s Office STRONGLY 
SUPPORTS H.B. 300 HD1 and humbly requests an amendment. Per Act 87, (SLH 
2023), as of July 1, 2025 the OWR will no longer be administratively attached to the 
Office of the Governor and will administratively transfer to the Department of Human 
Services. The OWR requests an amendment to H.B. 300 HD1 to add the OWR budget 
request to transfer positions and appropriations to the Department of Human Services.  
 
Since its establishment in 2022, the OWR has been carrying out our kuleana to 
strengthen our state service systems to create a trauma-informed state. The OWR 
breaks down barriers that impact the well-being of Hawai‘i’s people—from keiki to 
kūpuna, through trauma-informed care training and technical assistance, partnerships 
and collaboration, data and assessment, and policy and program development. OWR's 
12 statewide staff are currently managing approximately 100 projects and tasks, which 
primarily fall into these five categories: 
 
1. Data and Assessment 
Seven high-priority initiatives focus on data collection and organizational 
assessment, including: publicly available data dashboards on workforce wellness 
and social determinants of health, landscape analyses, organizational 
assessments, listening sessions identifying needs and barriers for workers, in 
both the State and in the community, etc. 
 
2. Partnership and Collaboration  
While partnership and collaboration underpin all our efforts, 36 projects 
specifically focus on coordinated initiatives, including: ongoing coordination of 
Maui recovery efforts; participation in state advisory groups about mental health, 

 
 
2 
 
wellness and resilience; public education events; state department engagement 
for developing trauma-informed programming, etc. 
 
3. Policy and Program Development   
22 projects target policy and program development across state and community 
sectors, including: managing and facilitating legislatively mandated working 
groups, development of a trauma-informed state within state departments, 
nonprofit and community-based organizations, and county agencies, advancing 
national policy work on trauma-informed care, supporting legislative policy 
development and session work, developing new trauma-informed initiatives 
within state departments and contracted providers. 
 
4. Training and Technical Assistance   
12 projects focus on developing, disseminating, and sustaining training and 
technical assistance for departments, encompassing: establishment of training 
academy for state departments, participation and leadership in national and state 
level conferences and trainings on trauma and trauma-related topics, including 
specialized training on secondary traumatic stress and vicarious trauma of the 
workforce, development of academic papers and articles for research and 
funding initiatives. 
 
5. Administrative Efforts 
Approximately 23 daily tasks are administratively focused (i.e., managing daily 
operations, internal and external communications and education, staff 
supervision, fiscal and contract management, etc.)  
 
The OWR appreciates the opportunity to present our Office’s biennium budget requests. 
Listed below is the OWR’s operating budget request for five-line items.  
 
We are looking forward to the continued programmatic and overall daily support from 
the Office of the Governor to address the wellness and resilience of our State workforce 
and communities. Additionally, we look forward to working with Department of Human 
Services to assist administratively in this new capacity. Please note that the OWR is in 
the process of establishing a Program ID within the Department of Human 
Services.

This request would continue to fund OWR's OCE at funding levels consistent with 
current levels. OCE funding would support the costs of implementation of the 
mandate such as: content specific consultants, social determinants of health data and 
research for dashboard development and management of data, development and 
management of trauma-informed care resource libraries, website, trainings, 
curriculum for dissemination, facilitation support, travel for neighbor island support 
and implementation of trainings, technical assistance and supervision support, annual

Maintain positions and funds for Act 106, (SLH 2024) 
State of Well-Being (SoWB) Project 
This request seeks continued funding for the SoWB program within the OWR at 
current levels. Since establishing the project in 2024, the OWR has filled all the six 
newly established positions and built partnerships with city, county, state, and 
community stakeholders. Our team is on track to deliver the mandated outcomes of 
Act 106: completing the landscape assessment by December 2025, enhancing Tier 1 
and 2 mental health and support services and identifying relevant metrics by 
December 2027. The Legislature generously funded this temporary program for one 
year through Act 106, (SLH 2024). Thus, the OWR requests $475,000 annually to 
maintain the six full-time positions and $401,000 per year for operational expenses 
(for consultant costs, program development, implementation strategies, community 
partnerships, listening sessions, travel for neighbor island support and supplies) 
throughout the biennium. 
Without this funding, the OWR will not be able to execute these critical deliverables to 
support, enhance and establish when non-existing, the mental health and well-being 
of first responders, healthcare providers, and school staff within the communities of 
need. The impacts of this work to assist in building the wellness and resilience of the 
workforce is described further below in closing.

This request is for $48,276 in incremental funding to account for two collective

At establishment and in subsequent periods, collective bargaining increases were not 
provided. The request would provide for an equitable work environment in line with 
other salary range positions with similar credentials and qualifications.

OWR Request for Personal Services Funding 
This request is for $40,804 in incremental funding to provide adequate funding for 
personal services and an equitable work environment in line with other salary range 
positions with similar credentials and qualifications. This request was submitted by 
Governor’s Message No. 4 (GM4). 
 
With this supportive funding, our state will be able to systematically and deliberately 
build and implement a comprehensive framework to better prepare, plan, respond and 
recover from traumatic events across the state. With the six SoWB positions, along with 
the other six positions from the Act 291 originating legislation, we hope to continue to 
build community wellness and resilience for both residents and the overall workforce to: 
 
1. Mitigate the impacts of early childhood trauma, also know as adverse  
childhood experiences (ACEs); 
 
2. Better prepare and respond to large-scale community traumatic and disaster- 
related events; 
 
3. Increase the state’s ability to support, recruit and retain a healthy workforce; and 
 
4. Build the clear path between early prevention of trauma and exposure to  
traumatic stress and the economic impacts of not addressing the core issues  
related to untreated trauma. 
 
According to a 2023 economic evaluation research study done by the Center for 
Disease Control1, the national economic burden of adverse childhood experiences 
(ACEs) related to adult health conditions and related costs was $14.1 trillion annually, or 
$88,000 per affected adult annually, with a $2.4 million impact over their lifetimes. 
Calculated in direct medical costs and lost healthy life-years, it would mean Hawaii’s 
population of 1.4 million, where approximately 1.1 million residents are over the age of 
 
1Peterson C, Aslam MV, Niolon PH, et al. Economic Burden of Health Conditions Associated With 
Adverse Childhood Experiences Among US Adults. JAMA Netw Open. 2023;6(12):e2346323. 

 
 
5 
 
19, 58% of those adults had experienced at least one ACEs, that equates to 
$56,144,000,000 of potential individual health care related costs, social service and 
workforce related costs, loss of income and potential tax collection impacts on those 
who are not engaged in the economic structure, incarceration and criminal justice costs, 
economic burden of the healthcare system costs and expenses on individuals.  
 
The impact of our work in the preventative realm, as well as the mid-stream 
intervention, programmatic and policy work, make this office uniquely positioned in its 
statute and mandate to impact not only the mental health and well-being of its residents, 
but also potentially the economic well-being of the state.  
 
The OWR expresses its sincere gratitude for the Legislature's continued support and 
remains available to address any questions or provide additional information as needed.

RELATING TO THE STATE BUDGET 
 
Honorable Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki, and members of the Senate Committee on Ways 
and Means, thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony on HB 300, HD1, relating to the 
State Budget. 
 
The Hawaii Public Housing Authority (HPHA) is in strong support with amendments of HB 300, 
HD1, which appropriates funds for the operating and capital improvement budget of the 
Executive Branch for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027. 
 
The following budget requests were amended or not included in HB 300, HD1, and the HPHA

Reasons for 
Request 
Among the current criteria considered when awarding Rental Housing 
Revolving Funds (RHRF) from the Hawaii Housing Finance and 
Development Corporation (HHFDC) include project readiness, project 
cost, and financing efficiency, affordability commitment, tenant 
amenities, and target households served.  These projects will take time 
to get plans, reviews, and permits and this Predevelopment funding will 
bring these projects closer to construction in a few years.   
 
HPHA and its redevelopment partner Highridge Costa Development 
Company have the capacity to move forward with both the construction 
of Mayor Wright Homes Phase IA and Predevelopment activities.  
These Predevelopment funds will go towards environmental studies, 
performing surveys, conducting inspections, creating specifications, 
drafting blueprints and plans, and obtaining permits.  Predevelopment 
will enable HPHA to continue to move forward with redevelopment plans 
to demolish functionally obsolete projects that have been marked for 
major redevelopment and expansion in an effort to develop and deliver 
urgently needed low-income and new affordable housing units to assist 
in meeting the goal of the Administration and Legislature for the creation 
of more affordable housing units.

Description 
of Request 
Ka Lei Momi Development Request Statewide 
$56,000,000 
Reasons for 
Request 
The requested funding will support the demolition of the existing, 
outdated public housing structures at Mayor Wright Homes and facilitate 
the construction of 309 new, modern, and energy-efficient affordable 
housing units.  This investment directly aligns with the Administration’s 
and Legislature’s strategic priorities to address the state’s housing crisis 
by increasing the supply of high-quality, affordable housing.  By 
replacing obsolete infrastructure with a sustainable, community-
oriented development, this project will enhance livability, improve 
resident outcomes, and contribute to the broader goal of expanding 
affordable housing opportunities for Hawaii’s families. 
 
On page 142, the following provision can be found for the 
redevelopment of Mayor Wright Homes:   
 
SECTION 12.  Provided that of the general obligation bond funds 
to be deposited into the Hawaii housing finance and development 
corporation's (BED160) rental housing revolving fund for fiscal year

2025-2026, the sum of $56,000,000 or so much thereof as may be 
necessary shall be utilized for the Hawaii public housing authority's Ka 
Lei Momi development Mayor Wright Homes project on Oahu; provided 
further that no funding shall be expended for any other Hawaii public 
housing authority Ka Lei Momi development project; provided further 
that if construction does not commence by August 31, 2026, the 
deposited funds may be utilized for other affordable housing projects of 
the Hawaii housing finance and development corporation; and provided 
further that the construction commencement date may be extended with 
the approval of the Hawaii housing finance and development 
corporation's board of directors and the governor. 
 
The HPHA is grateful for this appropriation in whatever way the 
Legislature deems appropriate to enable HPHA to move forward with 
Phase IA at Mayor Wright Homes.  However we would like to highlight 
the benefits to the State for having a direct appropriation into HPHA’s 
Program ID HMS220 to quickly proceed without administrative delays.  
Given recent DOGE mandated staffing reductions at the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development (HUD), which are expected to prolong 
federal approval timelines, we reached out to HUD’s HPHA assigned 
grant managers: the Director of the Office of Public Housing 
Investments and the Senior Neighborhood & Community Investment 
Specialist, and they concur that securing direct appropriations would 
enable HPHA to immediately initiate the federal Section 18 Demo/Dispo 
process as we will clearly demonstrate to HUD that the project has 
committed resources, potentially expediting the Section 18 review and 
advancing the project without unnecessary delays.  The Senior 
Neighborhood & Community Investment Specialist stated that “I think 
direct appropriation from the Legislature makes more sense, especially 
if it is fairly certain.  I know how it goes in Hawaii, so I do think that would 
add risk using an HHFDC administered fund”. 
 
In addition to expediting HUD reviews reducing delays, and accelerating 
the redevelopment of state-owned public housing, a direct appropriation 
to HPHA, rather than through HHFDC’s RHRF, will significantly 
enhance our ability to leverage federal funding and lower the project 
cost for the following reasons: 
   
• Removing unnecessary costs to our large-scale projects through 
HHFDC-imposed fixed interest charges—costs that would be 
eliminated with a direct appropriation. 
• Demonstrate the State’s commitment (“skin in the game”), 
boosting lender and investor confidence and securing more 
favorable loan terms and interest rates.  Lower interest rates on

large-scale projects will result in millions of dollars in savings over 
time, which can be reinvested into additional housing. 
• Flexibility in allocating a percentage of project cash flow toward 
RHRF repayment, limiting reinvestment flexibility. 
• Alignment with the unique financing needs of public housing 
redevelopment projects. 
• Eliminate the need for HPHA to submit a separate RHRF 
application and relieves HHFDC from the time-consuming 
review, scoring, and loan closing processes—streamlining 
approvals and accelerating project timelines.  The current RHRF 
process requires multiple administrative steps, resulting in 
months of delays and duplicated efforts.

As we navigate these challenging times, the importance of safe, affordable housing for our 
community’s most vulnerable cannot be overstated.  The Hawaii Public Housing Authority (HPHA) 
stands ready to address this critical need.  Your support in allocating the necessary funding and 
positions is essential for us to continue providing stable homes for our lowest-income families.  
By investing in housing, we invest in the health, safety, and future of our entire community.  We 
humbly request prioritizing this much needed funding.

State Capitol, Conference Room 211, and Videoconference 
 
In Support 
H.B. No. 300, H.D. 1, Relating to the State Budget 
 
Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki, and Members of the Senate Committee on Ways 
and Means: 
 
The Office of the Governor supports H.B. No. 300, H.D. 1, Relating to the State Budget.  
We respectfully ask for your favorable consideration of our Executive Budget requests. 
 
On December 16, 2024, Governor Green, M.D., submitted the Executive Budget for the 
2025-2027 Fiscal Biennium (FB) to the Legislature. The Administration's total requests include 
$10.5 billion in general funds and $3.4 billion in Capital Improvement Projects (CIP) for Fiscal 
Year (FY) 2026, and $10.5 billion in general funds and $2.5 billion in CIP for FY 2027. These 
requests include funding for priority areas to address significant needs in the following areas: 
 
1. Affordable housing and homelessness 
 
• $50,000,000 in general funds for each fiscal year to restore and increase general 
fund support for the development, maintenance, and operation of kauhale; 
• $50,000,000 in general obligation (G.O.) bonds for each fiscal year for cash 
infusions to the Rental Housing Revolving Fund (RHRF); 
• $75,000,000 in G.O. bonds for each fiscal year for cash infusions to the RHRF for 
Tier II affordable housing projects;  
• $20,000,000 in G.O. bonds for each fiscal year for infusions to the Dwelling Unit 
Revolving Fund (DURF); and 
• $56,000,000 in G.O. bonds for FY 2026 for Mayor Wright and Ka Lei Momi. 
 
2. Healthcare and hazard mitigation 
 
• $15,000,000 in general funds for each fiscal year for the Healthcare Education 
Loan Repayment Program (HELP); 
• $87,000,000 in each fiscal year in operating subsidy to support rural health care 
systems; 

Testimony of the Office of the Governor 
H.B. No. 300, H.D. 1 
March 18, 2025 
Page 2 
 
• $44,000,000 in CIP funding for Hawaiʻi Health Systems Corporation (HHSC) 
facilities, including Keaʻau Outpatient Center and Kona Community Hospital 
Emergency Department; and 
• $2,212,000 in general funds for each fiscal year for the Office of the State Fire 
Marshal to transfer to the Department of Defense. 
 
To support the responsibilities of the Office of the Governor, we respectfully ask for your 
favorable consideration of the following request: 
 
• Six full-time (6.00 FTE) permanent positions and $725,000 in general funds for 
each fiscal year for federal affairs and boards and commissions positions. 
 
The federal landscape has changed drastically within the past few months, with more 
changes likely on the horizon. Given the speed with which changes occur and the highly fluid 
nature of these changes, keeping abreast of federal affairs requires more time and resources 
than in years prior. Analyzing how such changes will, and do, affect the State and strategizing 
how the State can prepare for and comply with changes are essential to ensuring the State's 
continued fiscal and programmatic health.  
 
The Office of the Governor, therefore, requests the addition of 5.00 federal affairs 
positions, 3.00 to be stationed in Washington, D.C., and 2.00 to be here in Hawaiʻi. These 
positions will establish and cultivate strong working relationships with federal agencies in D.C. 
and regionally, opening up direct lines of communication to advocate for the State's priorities 
and needs. As the State continues to navigate these uncertain times, these federal affairs 
positions will provide a crucial lifeline through which to facilitate quick responses to and 
advocacy around federal funding and resources. 
 
The final 1.00 position requested will support the State's more than 170 boards, 
commissions, councils, committees, and authorities (hereinafter referred to as "boards and 
commissions"). Over 1,400 state residents serve on one of these state entities, and this number 
continues to grow with the addition of new boards and commissions as well as the expansion of 
existing boards and commissions' membership each session. This session, alone, dozens of 
boards, commissions, councils, committees, and authorities have been proposed.  
 
The Office of the Governor oversees the application and nomination process for all the 
State's boards and commissions but currently has only one position dedicated to this complex 
process integral to the filling and effective operations of the State's boards and commissions. 
Each of the State's 170 boards, commissions, councils, committees, and authorities is governed 
by its own statute with distinct geographic, background, and term requirements for each 
member, rendering the recruitment of nominees and the verification of their qualifications and 
background extremely time consuming and labor intensive. An additional position is critically

H.B. No. 300, H.D. 1 
March 18, 2025 
Page 3 
 
necessary to ensure each applicant and nominee is not only thoroughly vetted but also 
supported throughout the application and hearing process for these crucial positions.  
 
The Office of the Governor originally requested the transfer from the Office of the 
Governor to the Department of Human Resources Development (DHRD) of six full-time (6.00 
FTE) permanent positions and $470,000 in general funds for each fiscal year for the transfer 
from the Office of the Governor to DHRD of the Office of Wellness and Resilience (OWR). H.B. 
No. 300, H.D. 1, does not grant this request, removing all funding for OWR from the bill. We 
respectfully request the committee include this original transfer of positions and funds but 
amend the destination department from DHRD to the Department of Human Services (DHS).  
 
As the nation's first statewide-legislated office of its kind, OWR leads Hawaiʻi's efforts to 
become a trauma-informed state. OWR works with community and state stakeholders to 
strengthen the State's service systems and reimagine workplace wellness. This work is 
essential to the realization of a healthier, more resilient people of Hawaiʻi, so we humbly ask the 
committee to favorably consider the transfer of 6.00 (6.00 FTE) permanent positions and 
$470,000 in general funds for each fiscal year from the Office of the Governor to DHS.  
 
The Office of the Governor appreciates your consideration of our requests. Thank you for 
the opportunity to provide testimony on this measure.

ON 
HOUSE BILL NO. 300, H.D.1 
 
March 18, 2025 
10:00 a.m.  
Room 211 and Videoconference 
 
 
RELATING TO THE STATE BUDGET 
The Department of Budget and Finance (B&F) prefers and strongly supports the 
Administration bill. 
House Bill (H.B.) No. 300 requests appropriations for FY 2026 and FY 2027 
funding requirements for operating and capital improvements program (CIP) projects of 
the Executive Branch agencies and programs.  
Included in H.B. No. 300 are priority B&F funding requests that are necessary to 
support the operations of the Department and its attached agencies in meeting their 
statutory obligations.  I ask for your favorable consideration for all the B&F requests 
which include but are not limited to the following:  
• Increases debt service payments by $23,488,005 in FY 26 and $63,738,821 in  
FY 27. 
• Increases retirement benefits payments by $41,816,343 in FY 26 and $76,464,835 
in FY 27. 
• Increases Health Premium payments by $57,817,650 in FY 26 and $74,495,300 in 
FY 27. 

-2- 
 
• Adds 3.00 Accountant VI positions and $272,460 in FY 26 and $269,460 in FY 27 for 
the Financial Administration Division. 
• Adds $1,653,691 in both FY 26 and FY 27 for salary increases for all Deputy Public 
Defender positions. 
• Adds $6,844,527 in other funds in FY 26 and $2,823,706 in FY 27 to migrate the 
Employees’ Retirement System (ERS) Pension Administration System to a new 
version. 
• Adds $505,759 in other funds in FY 26 and $524,083 in other funds in FY 27 for 
internal compliance testing services. 
• Adds $567,000 in other funds in FY 26 and $515,000 in FY 27 for additional legal 
fees for the ERS. 
• Adds $600,000 in other funds in FY 26 for imaging and indexing services for the 
ERS. 
• Adds $572,695,000 in special fund ceiling in both FY 26 and FY 27 for the Mass 
Transit Special Fund. 
It is noted that the H.D.1 adds 5.00 FTE permanent positions and funds for the 
BUF 101 program which B&F strongly supports.  This House adjustment will make 
permanent 5.00 temporary positions in the Office of Federal Awards Management 
(OFAM) which are now funded by American Rescue Plan (ARP) Act funds through 
Fiscal Year 2026.  This House adjustment will allow the OFAM to expand its work to 
plan, organize, direct, coordinate, and conduct federal award activities to advance the 
management, administration, and oversight of federal awards made to State 
departments and agencies. 

-3- 
 
Finally, B&F requests your support regarding the budget proviso sections 6, 7, 
and 8 in HB No. 300, H.D. 1 which will again allow transfers of unrequired balances 
between these B&F budgeted fixed cost programs.  This is necessary for B&F to ensure 
the effective and timely implementation of these critical fixed costs payments as 
required by the statute. 
Departmental impact statements and follow up responses have been provided to 
your staff regarding the changes reflected in H.B. No. 300, H.D.1 and the Departmental 
B&F budget request items however, please let me know if additional information is 
required.  
Thank you for the opportunity to testify on this important administration bill.

Measure: 
H.B. No. 300, H.D. 1 
Title: 
RELATING TO THE STATE BUDGET. 
 
Position: 
 
The Public Utilities Commission (“Commission”) strongly supports this measure and 
offers the following comments for consideration. 
 
Comments: 
 
The Commission is in strong support of this Administration measure that appropriates 
funds for the operating and capital improvement budget of the Executive Branch for fiscal 
years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027. 
 
First, the Commission respectfully requests that the Committee reinstate the $1 million 
request that was amended by the House Committee on Finance.  This is a critical one-
time appropriation ceiling increase of $1 million for consultant services and contracts for 
Wildfire related services.  Since the August 2023 Maui Wildfires, the Commission has 
taken many initiatives in response to the growing threat of wildfires and other natural 
hazards to the State. The Commission is currently engaged in efforts to strengthen critical 
infrastructure, mitigate risks, protect utility customers, and ensure resilient recovery after 
extreme weather events.  For example, the Commission has required regulated utilities 
to submit natural hazard mitigation plans. This past January, the Commission opened a 
docket proceeding to review Hawaiian Electric’s (“HECO”) wildfire mitigation plan (filed 
on January 10, 2025) and plans to open a docket proceeding to review Kauai Island Utility 
Cooperative’s wildfire mitigation plan that was filed on January 28, 2025.  
 
The Commission will require technical advice on many aspects, including but not limited 
to, natural hazard (including wildfire) mitigation plans, resilience and reliability of electric 
utility services, and utility organization. 

H.B. No. 300, H.D. 1 
Page 2 
 
 
 
 
 
Second, the Commission is requesting two critical positions: an Engineer V and an 
Auditor V.  The Engineer V is required for implementing Act 166, Session Laws of Hawaii 
2012, where the Hawaii State Legislature created new sections under Chapter 269, 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (“HRS”), which provides a framework for the establishment of a 
Hawaii Electricity Reliability Administrator (“HERA”). Pursuant to HRS §269-142, the 
HERA’s scope also includes non-utility entities that operate on electric systems (i.e., 
independent power providers, ancillary service providers, etc.). In addition, due to the 
high cost of contracting for these services, the Commission plans to move HERA forward 
by contracting an outside consultant to be the HERA for a 12- to 18-month period.  During 
that time, the consultant will train Commission Engineering Staff, including the new 
Engineer V, to perform the HERA duties, which builds much-needed engineering capacity 
and expertise within the Commission, as well as lowers administration costs. 
 
The Auditor V is necessary due to the significant increase in utility rate cases, and the 
Commission expects this trend to continue primarily from private water and wastewater 
companies, as well as water carriers. In addition, the Auditor V will provide support for 
issues related to renewable portfolio standards and the impacts of the wildfires that have 
increased the number of priority dockets that address HECO’s financial stability and rate 
payer affordability.  In 2024, 11 new rate cases were added in addition to the 6 rate cases 
that are still pending for a total of 17 rate cases, which includes the ongoing HECO 
Companies Performance Base Ratemaking docket.   
 
Furthermore, the Legislature is currently considering multiple bills affecting the electric 
utilities that will require specialized expertise in the planning and implementation of any 
new laws.  The ceiling increase will be helpful for the Commission in other areas as well 
with the growing threat of storm-related power outages, grid restoration and preparation 
for rebuilding Maui’s infrastructure, and direct impacts of other natural disasters to the 
State.   
 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify on this measure.

Aloha Chair Dela Cruz:
Facing potential reductions or losses in federal discretionary funding, DLNR has assessed its federally 
funded positions and respectfully request consideration of an adjustment in the budget to convert select
DLNR positions currently funded by discretionary federal funds (MOF P) to a more stable funding 
source, MOF A, which is the general funds or MOF N, where feasible.
Given the uncertainty of federal funding, conversion to MOF A is preferred by DLNR to ensure 
continued program stability and workforce security.  This conversion will increase the capacity of these 
positions to perform other duties which are not currently performed due to the limitations associated 
with federal grant requirements – federal aid policy requires expenditures be identifiable and allocable
to a particular federal award and incurred specifically for a particular federal grant.  Additionally,
general funded positions are recoverable indirect costs.
Typically, MOF N funding is formula-based and not subject to the same discretionary appropriations 
risks as MOF P funding, which often relies on competitive grants. This adjustment is a cost-neutral 
measure and a prudent contingency, although this type of conversion limits the position’s proficiency 
and expertise to be used to the extent they are directly and exclusively related to the specific federal
grant program, allowable and allocable to the particular grant only.  This is also subject to funding
reductions, as the amount allocated to each recipient is based on a set formula that is determined by 
federal legislation, which can be amended to decrease overall funding or change the calculation factors,
leading to lower grant amounts for recipients depending on the new formula. 
Additionally, given the importance of the work provided by these positions, we are requesting to
convert the two (2) positions identified below from temporary to permanent. This conversion will 
reduce employee turnover and improve retention, thus providing the needed stability and staff 
continuity. 

The Honorable Donavan M. Dela Cruz

DLNR has identified the following positions that could be converted under this request:
DLNR recommends the conversion of these positions to MOF A, to allow us to continue to operate and 
manage our program objectives under anticipated budget constraints, and as a secondary option, to 
convert them to MOF N.  In addition to changing the means of financing, we are recommending the 
conversion of two (2) temporary positions to permanent.
We respectfully request that this adjustment be reflected in the budget to support DLNR’s ability to 
manage its workforce effectively and ensure continuity of services. Please contact me at (808) 587-0402

$16,832,073 in general funds each year for FY 2026 and FY 2027 to cover the 
department’s existing personnel, administrative and operating costs in HHL 625.  The 
increase of $1 in each fiscal year in HB300, HD1, is a place holder to indicate that 
additional information is needed on the request for $2,000,000 in general funds for each 
fiscal year for personal services reflected in GM4.  DHHL is requesting a restoration of 
funding for nineteen (19.00) unfunded FTE as well as additional FTE for the 
Department’s district offices to provide operational support and ensure that our 
unencumbered lands and homesteads are maintained and safely managed. 
 
The budget bill also includes requests for $10 million in general funds, 
$4,824,709 in special funds, $3,740,534 in trust funds, $7 million in revolving funds, 
$24,126,731 in authorization to receive federal funds, and $20 million in CIP funding for 
each fiscal year.  DHHL supports the addition of $200,000 in CIP funding for the Haiku 
Valley Omega Station Access Road that was added in HB300, HD1. 
 
The Hawaiian Homes Commission approved the “Sufficient Sums” budget 
request, which DHHL submitted to the Governor and the Legislature as detailed in our 
budget testimony that can be reviewed at: 
https://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/sessions/session2025/testimony/Info_Testimony_WAM_
01-06-25_HHL.pdf.  DHHL’s obligation to make this request is clear. 
 
We are most appreciative of the support given by the Legislature to the Hawaiian 
homes program.  Thank you for your consideration of our testimony.

DEPARTMENT’S POSITION:  The Department of Human Services (DHS) supports this measure 
and appreciates the House Committee on Finance’s focus on core and safety net programs 
given the State’s most recent economic forecast approach and federal policies.  DHS provides 
comments on the impacts of the HD1 amendments.  Lastly, DHS respectfully requests an 
amendment to add the budget of the Office of Wellness and Resilience per the forthcoming 
Governor’s Message. 
 
DHS leadership thanks the Legislature for its continuing support of the department's staff and 
operational needs.  DHS continues to provide vital benefits and services to Hawaii residents as 
we modernize our information systems and business processes. 
 
We acknowledge that many Hawaii residents are struggling to make ends meet and continue to 
apply for and require government assistance at near-record levels.  We recognize the immense 
value of the hardworking human services workforce and community providers who strive to 
provide services with Aloha in timely and responsive ways.  We know residents' and workers' 
success and well-being depend on safe and stable living and working environments, and having 
resources.

PURPOSE:  This bill appropriates funds for the operating and capital improvement budget of 
the Executive Branch for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027. Effective 7/1/3000. (HD1) 
 
Impacts of HD 1 Amendments 
 
Relevant to DHS, the Committee on Finance amended DHS budget requests by:  
 
• Changing the Office of Youth Services (OYS) 501YA-02 funds request for Youth Violence 
Prevention to non-recurring for the out years FY28 and beyond.  The impact of 
designating the appropriation as non-recurring makes long-term planning at both the 
state level and community provider level difficult.  These programs will close if funding 
ends in FY28.  
• Changing the OYS 501YA-06  funds request for Sex Trafficking Victim Support to non-
recurring for FY28 and beyond.  The impact of designating the appropriation as non-
recurring makes long-term planning at both the state level and community provider 
level difficult.  These programs will close if funding ends in FY28. 
• Changing the State Office on Homelessness & Housing Solutions (SOHHS) 777HH-01 
request for additional Kauhale funds to a $1 placeholder.  The $1 placeholder impacts 
future operation and maintenance of existing Kauhale and will stall necessary work to 
plan and develop additional Kauhale sites statewide. 
• Changing the SOHHS 777HH-BF1 operating budget to a $1 placeholder.  The $1 
placeholder on the operating budget impacts the continuity of the office of the 
Governor’s Coordinator on Homelessness, the leadership needed for the State to 
address coordinated solutions to homelessness statewide, and the development of 
housing initiatives. 
• Not concurring with the Benefit, Employment & Support Services Division (BESSD)’s 
903FA-05 request for funds to start a SNAP Smart Food Program.  Without funding, DHS 
will not be able to establish a program to allow Hawaii food producers and retailers to 
make specific surplus food items available at discounts to SNAP recipients in the specific 
stores where surplus inventories are identified through a mobile application.  This 
initiative is to help address food insecurity for SNAP individuals and families. 
• Changing MQD’s 401PE-01 request to establish the Special Fund Appropriation Ceiling 
for the Nursing Facility Sustainability Special Fund to non-recurring.  If the ceiling is non-
recurring, DHS will have to request to establish it again in the next fiscal biennium 
budget for SFYs 2027-29.  The uncertainty for the out years may result in a hesitancy to 
make any changes to the sustainability program as there would be no authority to spend 
these funds after FY 2027.  If there was no authority to spend from the nursing facility 
special fund, the increased reimbursement rates and the quality, pay-for-performance 
program for nursing facilities that these funds support would be cut, which would hurt 
access to care and threaten the financial viability of the nursing facilities.  
• 
Changing MQD’s 401PE-02 request to establish the Special Fund Appropriation Ceiling 
for the Hospital Sustainability Special Fund to non-recurring.  If the ceiling is non-

recurring, DHS will have to request to establish it again in the next fiscal biennium 
budget for SFYs 2027-29.  The uncertainty for the out years may result in a hesitancy to 
make any changes to the sustainability program as there would be no authority to spend 
these funds after FY 2027.  If there was no authority to spend from the hospital special 
fund, the increases in reimbursements and the quality, pay-for-performance program 
for hospitals that these funds support would be cut.  This would hurt access to care and 
quality improvement efforts, as well as hurt the financial viability of hospitals. 
• 
Changing the Med-QUEST Division’s (MQD) 902IA-01 request to establish a Special Fund 
Appropriation Ceiling for the Hospital Sustainability Special Fund to non-recurring.  If 
the ceiling is non-recurring, DHS will have to request to establish the ceiling again in the 
next fiscal biennium budget for SFYs 2027-29.  The uncertainty for the out years may 
result in a hesitancy to make any changes to the sustainability program as there would 
be no authority to spend these funds after FY 2027. 
• Changing the MQD’s 902IA-02 request to establish a Special Fund Appropriation Ceiling 
for the Nursing Facility Sustainability Special Fund to non-recurring.  If the ceiling is non-
recurring, DHS will have to request to establish the ceiling again in the next fiscal 
biennium budget for SFYs 2027-29.  The uncertainty for the out years may result in a 
hesitancy to make any changes to the sustainability program as there would be no 
authority to spend these funds after FY 2027. 
• The HD1 funds both years of MQD’s 401PE-07 request to add general funds for the Child 
Wellness Incentive Pilot Program and designates the appropriation as non-recurring.  
The Child Wellness Incentive Pilot Program established in Act 127, SLH 2022, will sunset 
on June 30, 2027.  Act 127, SLH 2022, makes a $50 payment to each state Medicaid 
benefit recipient for each completed well-child examination of that recipient parent's 
child, provided that only one payment may be made per child each year.   
 
Below are complete descriptions of the budget requests (on page 23, Capital Improvement 
Project Requests, and on page 26, Operating Budget Requests).  
 
The Hawaii Public Housing Authority will provide its comments on the HD1’s impacts on its 
budget requests. 
 
Request for Amendments to Add the Budget of the Office of Wellness & 
Resilience 
 
At the request of the Office of Wellness & Resilience (OWR) and a forthcoming Governor’s 
Message, DHS respectfully requests amendments to include OWR’s budget requests.  Pursuant 
to Act 87, SLH 2023 (Act 87), the Office of Wellness & Resilience (OWR) will transfer to the 
Department of Human Services on July 1, 2025.  Per Act 87, positions and appropriations, 
amongst other things, shall transfer to DHS.

was placed temporarily in the Office of the Governor as a semi-autonomous authority to 
support and implement the statewide framework for trauma-informed care and will 
need to be placed in a principal department.  Act 87, SLH 2023, further authorized all 
appropriations, records, equipment, machines, files, supplies, contracts, books, papers, 
documents, maps, and other personal property heretofore made, used, acquired, or

Informed Care Task Force;  
(2) Identifying common issues, unmet needs, and challenges encountered by 
departments and working to solve those issues through a cross-representation of 
State departments and the private sector, including private donors;  
(3) Seeking funding solutions using moneys that each department has access to, 
including Federal, State, and private sources, working with philanthropic 
organizations and other entities from the private sector to re-evaluate the State's 
funding priorities, and finding funding solutions to implement interdepartmental 
programming;  
(4) Interacting with community agencies, organizations, and other stakeholders to 
ensure the office is meeting the needs and wellness requirements of communities 
throughout the State; and  
(5) Creating an electronic dashboard on the social determinants of health that identifies 
a baseline of needs and concerns that impede high quality-of-life outcomes.

to:    
(1) Assess and enhance existing mental health training and ongoing support services 
to public schools, public community centers, first responder groups, police 
departments, fire departments, hospitals, and medical staff and, when non-
existent, build out culturally grounded community-informed well-being 
programming;  
(2) Track and measure aggregate mental health trends; and 
(3) Hire and train mental health specialists and work with approved partner 
organizations to lead project execution across tier 1 and 2 mental health support 
services in each key stakeholder community.

DHS Biennium Budget Priorities 
 
It is our highest priority to support the child welfare workforce as we work with the Office of 
Wellness & Resilience and the Malama Ohana Work Group and stakeholders to improve the 
child protective system and respond to community concerns.  These budget requests reflect the 

Department of Human Services 
March 17, 2025 
Page 8 of 73 
 
AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY AGENCY 
 
need for continued investment in the human services workforce and the work environment to 
improve the technology available to the public and staff and to ensure workplace safety.  The 
budget includes investment in Hawaii's health care programs, providers, and institutions that 
serve residents with Medicaid health coverage.   
 
Highlights of our priorities in this fiscal biennium (FB) budget for 2025-2027 include requests 
for: 
• Shortage differential for the recruitment and retention of child protective services 
workers; 
• Funds for the Comprehensive Child Welfare Information System (CCWIS); 
• Funds to support victims of sex trafficking; 
• Funds to continue the Family Resource Centers pilot program aimed to increase services 
for families in communities, schools, and a correctional facility as a prevention strategy 
to reduce child abuse and neglect and improve children's and parents' engagement in 
school; 
• Increased funding for In-home Home and Community-Based services that keep kupuna 
and people with disabilities in the community and avoid having to move them to 
significantly more expensive nursing facilities;  
• Sustained funding for increased reimbursement rates for most medical professional 
services to 100% of Medicare as funding is non-recurring;   
• Sustained funding  for Applied Behavioral Analysis services, Child Wellness Pilot 
program, as funding is non-recurring; 
• Funds for increased payments for death benefits as funding was only appropriated in 
Act 108, SLH 2024 for FY 2025; 
• The Hospital Sustainability and Nursing Facilities Sustainability Special Funds that 
support increased payments to hospitals and nursing facilities that serve residents on 
Medicaid; 
• Increased funds to address and reduce homelessness with continued development, 
maintenance, and operations of Kauhale; 
• Sustained funding for homeless services: Family Assessment Centers, Housing First, 
Homeless Outreach including legal services, and Rapid Rehousing – these items are 
currently non-recurring;  
• An additional year of funding to continue temporary housing and other recovery efforts 
for Maui Wildfire survivors;  
• Funds to continue the Summer Electronic Benefits Transfer Program (S-EBT) for 
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits for public school children 
during the summer break; 
• Funds to support youth mental health services provided through the Office of Youth 
Services; 

Department of Human Services 
March 17, 2025 
Page 9 of 73 
 
AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY AGENCY 
 
• A CIP request to continue modernizing the Benefits Eligibility System to improve the 
application for and delivery of financial Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Benefits 
(SNAP) and benefits; and 
• A ceiling increase of the Randolph Sheppard Revolving Account that supports the blind 
vendors program. 
Notably, the general fund additions that serve as state matching funds required for federally 
funded programs will allow DHS to access approximately $58.89M in additional federal 
matching funds or federal reimbursement for FY2026 and an additional $54.66M in FY2027 in 
federal funds.1 
 
The Department continues to process a high number of monthly applications, and Medicaid 
and child care caseloads remain above pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels as individuals and 
families continue to need assistance to meet Hawaii's high cost of living.  DHS leadership is 
mindful of the impacts of a slowing economy or higher consumer costs that have a direct 
relationship with more residents seeking public assistance.  Housing instability and evictions are 
major long-lasting disruptions to the well-being of children, families, and individuals, and 
increased funding to address housing instability and increasing housing inventory is necessary. 
 
From a workforce perspective, DHS continues to have high vacancy rates influenced by another 
year of long-term employees retiring in 2024.  There is also a general shortage of human 
services workers due to wage gaps and the cost of providing services to residents with complex 
needs.   However, DHS continues to recruit and fill positions, and has utilized the opportunity of 
the Governor’s Emergency Proclamation 25-02, Operation Hire Hawaii, to hire former federal 
workers. 
 
We must continue to have the resources and flexibility to innovate, train, and support career 
pathways and the professional development of the current and future human services 
workforce.   
 
The significant conditions impacting DHS operations and ability to meet all program goals are: 
• High vacancy rates across the department; 
• Continued high application rates and caseloads above pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels; 
 
1 DHS strategizes to maximize available federal funds.  The various federally funded or split-funded benefit 
programs often provide federal matching funds for operations, including personnel costs, or use a reimbursement 
model where the State upfronts 100% of the expenditures and then seeks federal reimbursement for a percentage 
of the expenditures.  Notably, these budget requests do not consider potential policy and fiscal changes that may 
be forthcoming by the federal.  
 

Department of Human Services 
March 17, 2025

• A return to pre-COVID-19 pandemic program rules while implementing other new 
program rules or processes;  
• Resources need to conduct 2023 Maui Wildfire response and recovery lines of effort, 
• The consequences of Hawaii's high cost of living and doing business, and  
• Uncertainties of new federal policies and impact on programming and funding with the 
current administration. 
With low unemployment and better-paying opportunities in the private sector, DHS will 
continue to face difficulty filling positions that will impact the department's ability to deliver 
timely benefits and services.  We continue to see high application and enrollment rates for 
SNAP and Medicaid programs as Hawaii residents continue to struggle to meet high housing 
and consumer prices, even as Hawaii's unemployment rate remains low.  If the national and 
state economies slow or face disruptions that increase consumer prices, we anticipate 
additional increases in applications and program enrollment as residents seek assistance. 
 
The SNAP program is hampered by the inability to fill eligibility worker positions necessary to 
authorize SNAP applications and benefits.  The November 2024 SNAP caseload serving 83,364 
households is above the caseload of pre-COVID January 2020 (=79,672 households).  COVID-19 
pandemic program waivers that allowed a high of 111,900 households in July 2021 ended in 
2024.   
 
As previously reported, DHS experienced a high error rate during the height of the pandemic, 
resulting in the U.S. Food & Nutrition Service issuing a fiscal penalty to the State. DHS has an 
administration measure for an emergency appropriation that will provide funds to improve the 
IT system to reduce errors as part of the penalty.    
 
Additionally, the return to regular program rules includes reinstatement of additional steps that 
have caused applicants and recipients to experience long wait times to have eligibility 
determined or maintained.  Congress also made additional adjustments to the SNAP program 
that DHS is addressing, along with amending program rules and modifying its system to address 
the changes that will increase program eligibility. 
 
However, in the summer of 2024, the SNAP program successfully implemented the first 
Summer Electronic Benefits Transfer (Summer-EBT) program to 90,000 public school students 
with $177 each during the summer break.  DHS is working on the 2nd year of the S-EBT program, 
which will require additional program requirements. 
The Medicaid program is also experiencing high application rates and enrollment levels.  In 
2024, the Med-QUEST Division (MQD) successfully redetermined eligibility for all Medicaid 
enrollees as a part of the "unwinding" from COVID-19 pandemic programming.  In December 
2024, the "new normal" for Medicaid program enrollment is hovering at 406,337; this is a 
decrease from the peak pandemic enrollment of 468,120 in 2023.  However, the current

enrollment level is nearly 80,000 more residents than the number enrolled in March 2020.  Of 
note, the "unwinding" included a reduction of the percentage of the base federal match for 
Medicaid, which may require a higher general fund appropriation to support the enrollment at 
the 400k "new normal."  
We anticipate continued housing instability and low inventory amongst Hawaii's low-income 
residents.  The State Office on Homelessness and Housing Solutions requests funding to 
increase the number of Kauhale ("tiny homes") projects statewide and to maintain the current 
Kauhale inventory.  Restoration of homeless services funding that supports Housing First (the 
State's permanent supportive housing program), homeless outreach including legal services, 
family assessment centers, and rapid rehousing services. 
Child care is also experiencing high participation rates as DHS distributed COVID-19 pandemic 
funds and implemented the state-funded expanded Preschool Open Doors (POD) program for 
Hawaii's 3- and 4-year-old children.  Parents benefit from child care subsidies to access 
affordable quality child care.  Parents and caretakers can go to work or school with confidence 
that their children are being well cared for. 
DHS dispersed $114,000,000 from the federal American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 
No. 117-2) (ARPA).  These ARPA funds sustained and buffered child care providers through the 
most tumultuous parts of the pandemic and recovery period.  Between December 2021 and 
September 2023, DHS distributed $72,000,000 of ARPA child care stabilization funds directly to 
616 licensed and registered family child care homes, group child care centers, group child care 
homes, infant and toddler centers, before and after school facilities, and exempt center-based 
providers of afterschool A+ services.  In November 2024, DHS concluded its supplemental grant 
program, providing an additional $42,000,000 directly to 617 child care providers between May 
and November 2024. 
The supplemental grants were intended to prevent permanent closures and support child care 
businesses by offsetting providers’ operating expenses, improving quality, and increasing 
workforce compensation so that child care providers could recruit and retain a skilled 
workforce.  Providers received two (2) rounds each of operating expense and staff retention 
awards which directors, teachers, assistant teachers, lead caregivers, and caregivers received a 
disbursement of $4,500, and all other caregiving staff received a disbursement of $3,000.  DHS 
is currently working on data collection and analysis of the supplemental grant program.   
The end of ARPA funding is a significant concern for the child care sector, and the Legislature 
may need to consider additional funds to support child care providers.   
DHS Child Care Programs Office successfully implemented the POD program's First Come First 
Served open application period, which runs from July 1, 2024 – January 31, 2025.  The change in

application processing per Act 153, Session Laws of Hawaii (SLH) 2024, allows DHS to process 
applications on a first-come, first-served basis after the priority period closes to allow a 
continuous enrollment process throughout the program year.  The change facilitates more 
access to subsidies and a school readiness program without delay.  Nearly 2,000 applications 
have been received, with July 2024 bringing in the highest total of 938 applications.  As of 
November 2024, 1,963 3- and 4-year-old children are enrolled in POD.  By the end of 
November, POD will achieve an enrollment count of more than 2,000 children.  This is a 
significant increase from the previous school year by more than 600 children.  The department 
is also considering rule amendments to further support the expansion of POD through 
increased eligibility limits and lowered co-payments for families. 
DHS leadership continues to lead the department's emergency management efforts.  The 
Director's Office continues to lead the Rent Assistance Program, the development of interim 
housing at Ka Lai Ola, and the FEMA Disaster Case Management grant program.  The SOHHS 
also maintains the Pu‘u Honua o Nene field shelter for individuals who were experiencing 
homelessness prior to the August 2023 wildfires.  The TANF program also maintains the Maui 
TANF Recovery Program providing cash assistance to families with children.  The Director's 
office also established a temporary auditor position to ensure that all Maui-related expenses 
are adequately documented and the recent hiring of the administrative assistant position in the 
Director's office should assist with updating the department's emergency management and 
continuity plans.  
Summaries by Division and the Office of Youth Services 
 
Benefit, Employment & Support Services (BESSD) 
 
Table 1. BESSD Position Counts. 
 
 
BESSD continues to experience high vacancies in its Statewide Branch Processing Centers due to 
retirements, a lack of interested applicants, and opportunities for higher-wage jobs, making 
positions difficult to fill.   The challenge of filling Eligibility Worker (EW) and Office Assistant 
(OA) positions is a national issue.  We continue to process the work despite having only three-
fourths (76%) of the optimal workforce of Eligibility Workers and less than half (49%) of the 
clerical support needed to manage the ongoing demand.  BESSD continues to recruit for both 
EW and OA positions actively, utilizes Wiki Wiki Hire, and conducts weekly interviews on Oahu.  
However, despite recruitment efforts, vacancies for OA positions have increased.  In an entry-

level position, as OAs gain more experience, they often move to positions within the state that 
have more responsibilities and higher pay.  
 
The continued high rate of vacancies highlights the critical need to fill and retain Eligibility 
Workers and clerical positions as the number of phone calls and applications for SNAP continue 
to increase.  Over the past year, the number of calls for interviews required for SNAP and other 
benefits has increased due to a combination of changes in federal policy and the ending of 
pandemic-era waivers.  In calendar year 2023,  the number of interview calls was 8,050 per 
month.  The number of interview calls increased to over 17,000 by September 2024 and to 
40,233 calls in November 2024. 
 
Table 2. BESSD Applications, Renewals, and Calls 
 
 
The SNAP caseload as of November 2024 (=158,425 individuals) is higher than the pre-
pandemic levels of February 2020 (=153,047 individuals).  However, the number of monthly 
applications in November 2024 (=7,129) is higher than the number of monthly applications 
received pre-pandemic in February 2020 (=4,412).  In October 2024, the number of applications 
(=9,083 applications) was more than double the average number of 4,500 applications received 
prior to the pandemic.

Figure 3. Graph of SNAP Households July 2019 – November 2024 
 
Despite the high rate of applications, caseloads have remained relatively stable, though 
trending upward, due to a high rate of application denials for various reasons, such as being 
over-income or failing to submit all required documents for verification.  In November 2024, 
over half (=58%, or 4731/8186 applications) were denied.   
 
In addition, in 2024, the federal law changed, authorizing SNAP eligibility for Compact of Free 
Association (COFA) citizens living in the United States.  The Consolidated Appropriation Act 
(CAA) of 2024 changed the federal law for Compact residents authorizing eligibility for SNAP, 
TANF, Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and FEMA assistance.  The CAA had a 
positive impact on residents from Compact nations and on states allowing federal assistance for 
its residents from COFA nations. 
 
In early 2025, DHS anticipates that the number of applications for SNAP will further increase 
due to a planned rule change to implement Broad Based Categorical Eligibility (BBCE) provisions 
and remove the net income limit for eligible households.  DHS has drafted amendments to the 
Hawaii Administrative Rules (HAR) to implement this change, and a public hearing was held on 
December 12, 2024.  A report by the University of Hawaii Economic Research Organization 
(UHERO) estimated that this policy change would add 14,000-15,000 additional households to 
the SNAP caseload. 
 
The unwinding of pandemic-era waivers has contributed to the increase in the workload for 
BESSD Processing Centers.  Prior to October 2024, the United States Department of Agriculture 
Food & Nutrition Services (FNS) authorized a waiver enabling DHS to conduct a desk review for 
eligibility renewals for SNAP and other benefits instead of requiring an interview.  During the 
COVID-19 pandemic, this waiver allowed DHS to process the highest volume of applications as 
residents struggled during the economic shutdown.  However, with the waiver's end, the 
interviews for eligibility renewals restarted in October 2024.  In November 2024, over 10,000

clients required eligibility renewals, which contributed to the increased number of individuals 
calling for interviews.   
 
BESSD is working to prioritize staffing on its call center to better respond to the increased 
number of calls.  The Processing Centers also continue to work overtime four Saturdays per 
month to address the application and renewal backlog.   
 
A continued priority for the Division is the development of a new Benefits Eligibility Solution 
(BES) eligibility system to replace the 40-year-old Hawaii Automated Welfare Information 
(HAWI) legacy system. The BES is scheduled to be implemented in mid-2026 and will include an 
automated rules engine and online Self-Service Portal that will streamline and increase 
efficiency in processing SNAP and other related benefits. 
 
In addition, BESSD continues to work on its oversight of other programs, such as Child Care 
Subsidy, Child Care Licensing, Employment & Training, the Homeless Programs Office (HPO), 
and the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP).  In 2024, BESSD launched a 
new online system for providers and residents and the Preschool Open Doors program to 
increase access to child care for eligible households with 3- and 4-year-old children. 
 
As we enter the 2025 legislative session, BESSD requests the Legislature's continued support to 
meet our resource needs. This will allow us to improve our delivery of needed benefits and 
services to Hawaii's residents and our working environment and conditions. 
 
Division of Vocational Rehabilitation Services (DVR) 
DVR administers statewide vocational rehabilitation services programs for persons with 
physical, cognitive, and mental health disabilities.  These programs include independent living 
rehabilitation services for persons with disabilities, general services for persons who are blind 
and visually impaired, and the disability determination of claims for Social Security Disability 
Insurance and Supplemental Security Income benefits issued by the Social Security 
Administration.   
DVR provides vocational rehabilitation programs as required by the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 
as amended, the Randolph-Sheppard Vending Stands Act, the Workforce Innovation and 
Opportunity Act, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, the Americans with Disabilities 
Act, and other applicable federal and state laws, regulations, policies, and agreements with 
other state agencies and the federal government. 
DVR MISSION – DVR serves participants who require assistance to prepare for, secure, retain, 
or advance in competitive, integrated employment.  DVR staff works as a team so that 
participants can achieve their hopes and aspirations for meaningful employment through timely 
and individualized vocational rehabilitation services.

DVR estimates that federal vocational rehabilitation funding will be $16,380,877 in FFY 2025 
(October 1, 2024-September 30, 2025) with a required State match of $4,433,452 starting in 
FFY25.  
In 2024, DVR commenced work on the Neighbor Island Blind and Visually Impaired pilot 
program authorized by Act 253, Session Laws of Hawaii 2023.  The 2023 Maui Wildfire response 
delayed DVR's work on the pilot.  However, DVR procured a contractor, met with stakeholders, 
and developed a plan.  DHS is proposing an administrative measure (SB 1419 SD1 RELATING TO 
ACT 253, SESSION LAWS OF HAWAII 2023) to revise the pilot.  Additional appropriations will be 
required and are pending a Governor's Message.  The pilot program will assist neighbor island 
residents who are blind or have low vision to gain skills that will improve their communication 
and independence.  The pilot will serve individuals who may not be interested in employment 
and who do not qualify for services available through the Department of Education or to 
individuals 55 years or older. 
DVR is seeing an increase in applications for services from Hawaii residents with disabilities who 
are eager to prepare for, obtain, retain, or advance in competitive integrated employment in 
the workforce.  Additionally, DVR continues to work with employers in all sectors to encourage 
them to hire qualified individuals with disabilities. 
The Randolph-Sheppard Revolving Account ceiling increase request of $669,800 for HMS 802 
will ensure that DVR has access to the special funds supporting necessary services to our blind 
vending program. This ceiling increase does not affect or increase DVR’s current State funding. 
In Program Year 2023 (July 1, 2023 – June 30, 2024), the Division of Vocational Rehabilitation 
(DVR) was tasked with achieving five performance indicators set by our federal funder, the 
Rehabilitation Services Administration of the U.S. Department of Education. These measures 
include:  
1. Credential Attainment Rate – The percentage of participants enrolled in an education or 
training program (excluding those in On-the-Job Training and customized training) who obtain a 
recognized postsecondary credential or a secondary school diploma or its equivalent during 
participation or within one year after exiting DVR’s program services;  
2. Employment Rate for the 2nd Quarter After Exit – The percentage of participants who are 
still employed six months after exiting DVR;  
3. Employment Rate for the 4th Quarter After Exit – The percentage of participants who are still 
employed twelve months after exiting DVR;  
4. Median Earnings – The median earnings of consumers who are employed six months after 
exiting DVR; and   

Department of Human Services

5. Measurable Skills Gains (MSG) Rate – The percentage of consumers enrolled in training 
programs who achieve documented skills gains. *Note: Although MSG was initially set as a 
negotiated performance level, national data has proven unreliable for measuring performance 
and, therefore, was not utilized in Program Year 2023. 
DVR achieved two out of four performance indicators (Credential Attainment Rate and Median 
Earnings) for Program Year 2023 (July 1, 2023 - June 30, 2024). While DVR did not meet two of 
the four indicators, no sanctions were imposed since the actual employment rates for the 2nd 
and 4th quarters after exit were above the Indicator Score of 50%, with scores of 80.8% and 
75.8%, respectively.

The achievement of two out of four performance indicators is significant, especially considering 
DVR’s high vacancy rate, which is currently around 40% due to retirements and resignations. 
Initiatives are in progress to retain our excellent staff and fill vacancies. These initiatives include 
revision of minimum qualifications, streamlining processes, reviewing pay rates, planning for 
additional needed positions, and enhancing clear, positive communication. 
 
Med-QUEST Division (MQD) 
 
  
The Med-QUEST Division (MQD) administers Medicaid that provides health coverage, and state-
funded medical assistance programs, primarily through managed care plans, to eligible Hawai‘i 
residents.  Medicaid started in 1965 under Title XIX of the Social Security Act and is 
administered as a joint federal-state program that provides health coverage and long-term care 
for children, pregnant women, parents of eligible children, low-income adults, former foster 
care children, aged, blind, and disabled individuals.  MQD’s mission is to empower Hawai'i’s

residents to improve and sustain well-being by developing, promoting, and administering innovative 
and high-quality healthcare programs with aloha. 
As of March 10, 2025, the Med-QUEST Division (MQD) provides Medicaid coverage for over 
404,000 residents, representing about 28 percent of Hawaii's population.  While this percent is 
higher than before the start of the pandemic, it is a decrease from the 468,120 enrollees at the 
peak of the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency in April of 2023.  The "new normal" is over 
70,000 members higher than the 327,000 caseloads that preceded the COVID-19 pandemic.   
In 2024, MQD completed one of its largest undertakings to date: redetermining the eligibility of 
all Medicaid enrollees as required by the end of the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency, which 
is known as the "unwinding."

Social Services Division - Child Welfare Services and Adult Protective & Community Services 
 
The Social Services Division (SSD) provides services to eligible families and individuals.  The Child 
Welfare Services Branch (CWS) provides prevention and intervention services to reduce the 
incidence and impact of child abuse and neglect.  The Adult Protective & Community Services 
Branch (APCS) responds to reports of adult neglect or abuse and oversees the Adult Foster Care 
Program, Senior Companion Program, Foster Grandparent Program, Nurse Aid Training, and Re-
Certification curriculum.  
 
The Division's priorities are to work with the Office of Wellness & Resilience and the Malama 
Ohana Working Group to address community concerns, implement pay differentials for child 
welfare services workers as a retention strategy, and add additional security in child welfare 
offices.  Notably, SSD continues to modernize its case management systems so case workers 
and administrators can access case information to better serve children and families.  Social 
workers need better tools that improve processes and give workers more time to spend with 
children and families, and connect with providers and resource caregivers. 
 
CWS is moving forward with its Comprehensive Child Welfare Information System (CCWIS), 
named HI-THRIVE.  CCWIS financing is eligible for 50% federal reimbursement.  Currently, DHS 
estimates the overall planning and implementation cost of CCWIS in the range of $35 million to 

Department of Human Services 
March 17, 2025

AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY AGENCY 
 
$40 million, with a 50/50 federal reimbursement.  However, costs to other states that have 
already developed their CCWIS project range from $60 million to $80 million. 
 
Once in place, CCWIS will improve the workers' and supervisors' case management, enable 
easier extraction for reporting requirements, and give CWS more opportunities to draw down 
available Title IV-E funds.   
 
APCS is moving forward with modernizing its data system, Living Aloha for Vulnerable Adults 
(LAVA), with the assistance of Federal grant money and requests general funds to build upon 
the completed work. 
 
Once implemented, CCWIS and LAVA will facilitate data entry, support higher-quality data, 
allow for more accurate and timely reporting, offer decision-making guidance, and provide 
more access to and data sharing with clients and our external partners. 
 
 
Office of Youth Services  
With a solid commitment to meeting the needs of children and families, the Office of Youth 
Services (OYS) is responsible for the planning, case management, and delivery of services to 
youth at risk (section 352D-1, HRS).  In addition, OYS oversees the Hawaii Youth Correctional 
Facilities (HYCF), the Kawailoa Youth and Family Wellness Center (section 352D-7.5, HRS), and 
the support staff for the Hawaii State Youth Commission (section 352D-11, HRS). 
Community-wide juvenile justice reform, including an investment in OYS contracted programs, 
has had a positive impact on reducing juvenile arrests and successfully diverting youth from the 
justice system.  Figure 1 shows the number of individual juveniles arrested for both status and 
law offenses.  Arrests in both categories for FY23 are lower than in pre-pandemic fiscal years 
2017 through 2019.

These positive results are due to upfront system prevention programs and services for at-risk 
youth, including positive youth development, cultural programs, outreach and advocacy,

increased needs of children will counteract these positive trends, decrease public safety, and 
increase youth entering into and moving deeper through the juvenile justice system.

Figure 7. Total HYCF Admissions FY2008 – FY2024 
Figure 7 above shows juvenile admissions to HYCF from fiscal years 2008 through 2023.  From 
2009, when Hawaii invested in the national Juvenile Detention Alternatives (JDAI) program, to 
2023, admissions to HYCF were reduced by 83%.  Alarmingly, admissions to HYCF in FY23 
increased by 64% from the preceding year, with a slight decrease in FY24.  With concerns that 
youth behavioral and mental health issues are rising, it is expected that more youth will enter 
the juvenile justice system and HYCF. 
Any increase in the population at HYCF demonstrates a system that is not meeting the 
community’s need for increased support post-pandemic.  With the additional displacement and 
trauma experienced by victims of the 2023 Maui wildfires, community needs will continue to 
increase in the upcoming years.  Investment in front-end programs and services is needed to 
maintain progress and to reduce justice system involvement for at-risk youth.  OYS includes a 
request for funds for youth mental health programs. 
 
Hawaii State Commission on the Status of Women 
 
In 1964, Governor John A. Burns created the Hawaiʻi State Commission on the Status of Women

penalty letter (see below discussion).  Considering that FNS is allowing DHS to reinvest 50% of 
the penalty towards implementing more fully developed functionality, DHS knows that 50% of 
the penalty is not enough to ensure all root cause areas impacting the payment error rate that 
can be automated will be automated to reduce the chances of user error being introduced into 
the workflow.   
 
This budget request is to supplement the reinvestment of the 50% penalty amount that will 
support BES system development and testing of functionality.  Specific functionality in BES that 
will improve worker accuracy and reduce payment errors include the elimination of manual 
forms for interview documentation, the development of an interview workflow builder to guide 
an Eligibility Worker through the interview process, and an automated rules engine that will 
apply Hawaii Administrative Rules and federal policies based on inputs to the system. 
 
The anticipated completion of BES, including functionality to reduce payment errors, will be in 
the Fall of 2025.  Additional funds for the coming biennium will allow BESSD to complete the 
system development work, including testing of new functionality, roll out BES into production, 
and be available to both the public and the BESSD line staff.  The development will be done 
through a contract and BESSD's current system developer.  The entire $10M for FY26 is needed 
in addition to the $5,467,164 requested through an Emergency Appropriation for FY25 (HB1099 
HD1/SB1418 SD1 MAKING AN EMERGENCY APPROPRIATION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN 
SERVICES) to ensure that BES is implemented with full functionality and that Hawaii has a 
functioning eligibility system that will reduce payment errors and help the State to avoid 
further financial.  A capable and modern eligibility system should improve residents' 
experiences. 
 
On June 28, 2024, FNS notified Hawaii that it had failed to achieve a SNAP payment error rate 
for federal fiscal year 2023 at or below the national average of 11.68%.  Hawaii's payment error 
rate was 20.94%.  This marked the second year in a row that Hawaii failed to perform below the 
national payment error rate.  As a result, FNS accessed a penalty of $10.9 million against 
Hawaii.  FNS offered Hawaii the option of paying the penalty in whole or agreeing to reinvest 
50% of the penalty into improvements that would result in an improvement of its payment 
error rate.  Hawaii elected to enter into an agreement with FNS to reinvest 50% of the penalty 
into system improvements to automate the eligibility and payment determination process.  The 
50% of the $10.9M FNS penalty will be requested through an emergency appropriation for FY25 
for $5,467,164.  The emergency appropriation is needed in this fiscal year to align needed 
modifications with ongoing BES development.

FY26.1 - KYFWC Master Plan, Oahu 
DAGS002 04-02-21 The original budget is to create and develop a process for the Master Plan to 
upgrade and renovate the Kawailoa Youth and Family Wellness Center (KYFWC).  This project 
will prioritize the CIP Implementation plan, provide budgetary estimates, and prepare an 
Environmental Impact Statement.  These improvements will add another 25 years of longevity 
to the campus and create a safe space for a transitional/residential/Mental Health program for 
Hawaii high-risk youth and their families. 
 
The KYFWC campus, on the Kailua grounds of the Hawaii Youth Correctional Facilities, is 96 
years old, built in 1928 as the Kawailoa Training School for Girls by the Territorial Government 
of Hawaii.  The Master Plan will allow for much-needed upgrades for campus infrastructure, 
demolish condemned buildings, and create additional needed program space for youth mental 
health programming.  The Master Plan is needed for KYFWC to adapt to the changing needs and 
services the youth require. 
 
Youths need a higher level of mental health treatment.  Currently, the State sends youths with 
multiple mental health diagnoses to the mainland for treatment when in-state services are not 
available.  The community alternatives for mental health residential-type programming are 
limited, and there are no readily available alternatives to assist high-risk youth.  Hawaii needs to 
increase planning for the care of the high-risk population so these youths can get proper 
treatment, be near their support systems and community, and not have to be relocated to 
another state. 
 
KYFWC is also being designed to manage social service gaps in our state systems (Department 
of Health, Child Adolescent & Mental Health Division (CAMHD), Department of Education 
(DOE), DHS Child Welfare Services (CWS), the Judiciary, and OYS to focus on older youth and 
young adults from 14 - 24 years of age.  The programs at KYFWC will be primarily designed to 
assist in the transitioning of youths out of state services while providing critical support needed 
for youth and young adults to leave KYFWS's programs successfully. 
 
 
FY26.2 – KYFWC/HYCF Secured Custody Facility (SCF) Reroof Oahu 
This request is to assess and evaluate the structural integrity of the roof, and design and 
construct new roofing.  The roof design and construction have to be within the scope of the 
state historical site standards and are part of the building's overall maintenance.  
 
The HYCF Secured Custody Facility was built in 1995 to house male wards of the state.  This 30-
bed correctional structure currently houses both male and female juveniles who were 
committed to the Office of Youth Services by Family Court.  SCF serves as the state's only 
juvenile correctional facility.

Repairs to the roof are necessary to maintain the overall structural integrity after 30 years of 
use. The weather has taken its toll, and there is water leakage after heavy rains, which impacts 
electrical security systems, causing safety issues.  There are no alternatives to fixing the leaking 
roof. 
 
The project intends to increase the life of the correctional structure and reduce our operational 
and maintenance costs.

501YA-01: Add 1.00 Permanent FTE Position and Funds for the Office of Youth Service (OYS) 
 
This request adds 1.00 permanent FTE and funds for OYS.  In 2007, the OYS was staffed with 30 
positions, including 12 Program Specialists and seven clerical staff.  In 2024, OYS is currently 
staffed with 19 positions, including 8 Program Specialists and three clerical staff.  Two of these 
Program Specialists and one clerical staff are specifically assigned to our statewide Office of 
Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) Title II federal grant program, and another 
Program Specialist specifically oversees the Youth Commission.  As a result, all other 
responsibilities of the program development office and OYS administration are performed by 
the remaining 14 staff members.   
 
Since 2007, OYS' responsibilities and workload have increased significantly to include 13 
additional contracts for a full continuum of care for at-risk youth and Grant-In-Aid (GIA) 
assignments, implementation of diversion programs (Act 201, SLH 2014), the Kawailoa Youth

community partners (HCR 72, SLH 2023), and other initiatives to improve collaboration, 
partnerships, and promotion of system changes for positive outcomes for youth. 
OYS HMS 501 respectfully requests 1.0 FTE permanent civil service Program Specialist V grant 
writer position to leverage federal grant dollars for youth programs that will enhance our 
continuum of care to increase positive outcomes for youth. 
 
Ideally, to adequately meet our statutory goals and responsibilities, OYS would need to restore 
some of its positions, including 1.0 FTE for a permanent civil service Administrative Assistant II 
SR14 position for the Program Development Office, which oversees all contracts and GIAs, 
diversion programs, program planning and development, and many other initiatives. This 
position would assist with the current workload and be able to cross-train and cover duties 
when the only Administrative Assistant is on leave. 
 
501YA-02:  Youth Violence Prevention 
 
OYS currently budgets $385,500 annually for outreach and advocacy services, which serves 
approximately 90 youths who are at-risk, status offenders, or gang-involved.  Of these funds, 
$38,500 is dedicated to the Honolulu Police Department, District 8 (D8), which includes 
Nanakuli and Waianae, which serves approximately 20 youth annually.  This budget request is 
to triple violence prevention outreach and advocacy services in D8, Ewa, Makakilo, Nanakuli, 
Waianae, and Makaha. 
 
Recent data shows increases in reported violence in D8, where homicides were up 80% and 
weapons offenses were up 42% between 2022 and 2023.  The number of recent violent 
incidents involving youth on the Nanakuli-Waianae Coast is alarming.  A few of the high-profile 
cases are as follows:  In April 2024, three teens were accused of attacking and robbing a man; in 
February 2024, a 17-year-old was arrested in connection with the murder of a rancher; in 
January 2024, a youth was arrested in the shooting of a man killed by a stray bullet while in the 
man was sitting in his driveway; in November 2023, a 16-year-old male and a 21-year-old 
female were stabbed at a beach park; in September 2023, a teen was arrested for murder in an 
incident that left two people dead; and in June 2023, a 17-year-old female was shot in the head 
at Maili Community Park.  Many of the youth involved in these violent acts are not gang-
involved. 
 
Youth violence has significant and prolonged effects on young people’s mental and physical 
health as well as on the community.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC), youth violence impacts development, decision-making, the ability to learn 
and cope with stress, as well as connections to peers and adults.  It is linked to adverse health 
outcomes that disproportionately affect communities of color.  Exposure to violence increases 
the risk for behavioral and mental health difficulties, which include future violence perpetration 
and victimization, as well as depression, academic difficulties, and suicide.  Hawaii’s youth are 
in need of extra support, outreach, and advocacy to improve well-being and reduce violence.

501YA-03:  Youth Mental Health Support 
 
This request is to increase funding to four residential safe houses, including one girl safe house 
on Hawaii Island and boys safe houses on Maui, Hawaii Island, and Oahu ($650,000).  This 
request also serves to provide specialized funding to increase mental health services to LGBTQ+ 
youth, a population identified as being at high risk for self-harm, substance abuse, behavioral 
and mental health issues, and becoming victims of abuse and trafficking ($200,000). 
 
In 2024, the Legislature provided the following amounts that are non-recurring:  This request is 
is restore the funds for the biennium and for the funds to be recurring as part of OYS' base 
budget: 
• Safe House boys $162,500 x 3 
• Safe House girls $162,500 x1 
• LGBTQ+ $200,000 
• Non-Eligible CAMHD Youth $150,000 
Total = $1,000,000 
 
In accordance with section 352D-D, HRS, OYS is responsible for providing services to at-risk 
youth and facilitating optimum service delivery, preventing delinquency, and reducing 
recidivism through prevention, rehabilitation, and treatment.  OYS creates opportunities for at-
risk youth to become productive, responsible citizens through community-based and family-
focused interventions.  Among these interventions are housing and mental health services for 
youth.  Since the pandemic, youth have been displaying increased criminogenic risk factors and 
behavioral and mental health issues. 
 
Additionally, OYS has worked with CAMHD to provide mental health treatment to youth who 
are not eligible for CAMHD services.  OYS' original 2017 contract was for $300,000 annually.  In 
2021, due to budget cuts, this contract was reduced to $60,000 annually.  In 2022, OYS 
increased funding to $150,000 annually to address the increased demand for mental health 
services for youth in the community.  However, this amount of funding is not meeting the 
needs of youth.  In the calendar year 2022, OYS received 49 referrals for services.  In only the 
first six months of 2023 (January - June), OYS received 56 referrals.  During this same period, 
costs for mental health services to these youth were $230,606.07 annually, well beyond the 
capacity of OYS' current contract costs.   
 
The proposed budget reduces OYS’ appropriations in the amount of $1,632,500, for youth 
residential programs.  This includes $800,000 for Safe Spaces youth homelessness that may be 
alternative appropriated in HB613.  This also includes $832,500 in non-reoccurring funds 
allocated in FY25 to cover lost COVID-19 programmatic funds.  These funds have been allocated 
to Safe House contract cost increases. The loss of these funds will have significant impact on 
youth residential services.

501YA-06:  Sex Trafficking Victims Support 
The current $400,000 funded by the 2024 Legislature is non-recurring under HMS 503.  This 
budget request is for $500,000 to be recurring to support victims who were sex trafficked on 
Oahu and Maui under HMS 501. 
$400,000 - Provides short-term, 30-day, or less emergency shelter services for youth 12-17 
years old who are suspected or determined to be victims of commercial sexual exploitation or 
labor trafficking.  This program accepts referrals from DHS CWS, the Family Court, law 
enforcement agencies, parents/guardians, other youth-serving agencies, and youth victims.  
Under section 352D-7.5, HRS, access to services will be made available by OYS to all youth at 
risk of being sexually exploited and to youth victims of sex trafficking at the Kawailoa Youth and 
Family Wellness Center.  While the shelter has moved off campus, youth at Kawailoa continue 
to be referred to this program.   
 
Research shows a pathway of sexual exploitation, especially for girls involved in the juvenile 
justice system, including those committed to the Hawaii Youth Correctional Facility (HYCF).  The 
majority of female youth at HYCF have a history of sexual exploitation and abuse.  These 
emergency shelter services for exploited children have contributed significantly to the 
reduction of girls committed to HYCF over the past decade and reached a milestone of zero girls 
incarcerated in 2022 for 80 days.  Overall, there has been a significant reduction in youth, 
especially girls, being committed to HYCF, where the general population of girls is 1-5.  The 
current funding is non-recurring.  This budget request is for recurring funds as a part of OYS' 
base budget. 
$100,000 - Ongoing support to female children experiencing sexual exploitation and abuse on 
Maui.  Following the Maui wildfires, OYS saw an increase in female youth victims requiring 
emergency shelter and support.  With the temporary closure of Oahu's shelter and resulting 
cost savings, OYS diverted $100,000 to Maui.  However, funding to continue the emergency 
shelter for girls in Maui should be recurring and part of OYS' base budget.

503YB-01:  Additional Positions at the Kawailoa Youth and Wellness Center (also known as 
Hawaii Youth Correctional Facility) 
Kawailoa Youth and Family Wellness Center (KYFWC), on the grounds of the Hawaii Youth 
Correctional Facility (HYCF), has seen an 83% decrease in its incarcerated population within the 
past decade as a result of Juvenile Justice Reform.  This decrease resulted in the closing of two 
of its three correctional structures.  However, through staff attrition, we no longer have the 
staff required to maintain the level of programs and safety of the environment for KYFWC's 
correctional structure.   
The profile of the currently incarcerated population has a significant increase in medical and 
mental health concerns that often require professional expertise outside of KYFWC staff and 
require more detailed attention by our on-site staff, Youth Correctional Officers.  Common 
medical issues include dental issues (lack of oral care), sexually transmitted diseases, heart 
conditions, diabetes, autism, and other conditions.  These youth represent the most vulnerable 
of Hawaii’s high-risk youth and require additional services.  
Two additional Youth Correctional Officer (YCO) positions are requested and would (in addition 
to normal position duties) be utilized for transportation purposes so as not to shorten the line 
staff needed to maintain the integrity of programs to include education, substance abuse, 
mental health, recreation, and daily living.  Ideally, however, a total of 5 YCOs would allow HYCF 
to maintain full operations, including programs, transportation, and safety measures.  The 5 
YCO positions would represent a partial restoration of 10 youth correctional facility positions (8 
Youth Correctional Officers, 1 Youth Corrections Supervisor, and 1 Social Worker III) that were 
abolished as part of Act 88, SLH 2021. 
In order to continue the development of the KYFWC campus, our current and future needs will 
be a Planner VI position to assist and manage the Kawailoa Youth and Family Wellness Center 
(KYFWC) programs.  Act 208 (SLH 2018), Relating to Juvenile Justice Reform, created the KYFWC 
for services and programs that may include but are not limited to mental health services and 
programs, substance abuse treatment programs, crisis shelters for homeless youth, crisis 
shelters for victims of human sex trafficking, vocational training, group homes, day treatment 
programs, aftercare, independent and family counseling services, educational services, and any 
other services and programs.  These programs require contractual management, organization, 
and systemic alignment to multiple state services for Hawaii's most vulnerable at-risk youth and 
vulnerable young adults.  The multitude of programs by collaborating state agencies and 
community service providers is a model that Hawaii can be proud of.  As KYFWC is adapting to 
the services youth need, the load of managing KYFWC is increasing, and we need a Planner VI 
position to ensure continued success on behalf of our youths.

HMS 224 - Homeless Services 
 
 
224HS-01: Funds for Family Assessment Center 
 
Homelessness continues to persist as one of the most pressing issues facing Hawaii.  
Additionally, the demand for homeless services has steadily increased from 2022 to the 
present, reflecting the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.  During this period, the 
number of homeless individuals per the annual statewide Point in Time Count has increased by 
7% from 5,967 to 6,389.  Based on a review of data following the 2009 economic recession, 
homelessness is projected to continue steadily increasing for the next several years and is 
expected to impact both single adults and families with minor children.  Specifically, between 
2009 and 2016, the number of people experiencing homelessness increased from 5,782 to a 
high of 7,921, a 37% increase over the 7 years.  Accordingly, there is a need to sustain effective 
homeless services that emphasize placement into permanent housing to mitigate future 
increases in the number of individuals and families experiencing homelessness. 
 
This request will sustain funding for the Family Assessment Centers (FACs), which are a 
successful and critical tool to address homelessness specifically for families with minor children.  
The state framework to address homelessness includes a focus on a "Housing First" approach 
statewide.  The FAC is a model of low-barrier shelters utilizing the "Housing First" philosophy to 
quickly move families with minor children off the streets and into transitional shelters or 
permanent housing.  There are currently two FACs in operation - one in Waianae and one in 
Puna - that would be adversely impacted if funding for FAC services is not sustained.  
 
The first FAC in Kakaako opened in September 2016, accommodating 12-15 families (up to 50 
people) at any one time.  In the last eight years of operation under the management of Catholic 
Charities Hawaii, the center served 326 households, placed 52.67% into permanent housing, 
and increased the income for 59% of families served.

The original FAC in Kakaako closed in late 2022 when the city reclaimed control of the facility.  
To replace it, DHS relocated the FAC to a new site on O‘ahu.  During the interim year, the FAC 
operated remotely, focusing on supporting families who had previously exited the program to 
ensure they maintained their permanent housing.  The FAC later relocated to serve the 
Waianae Coast.  The Point in Time Count (PIT) reports indicated that Waianae had the largest 
percentage of unsheltered individuals on the island, with 27% or 630 individuals in 2023 and 
28% or 785 individuals in 2024. 
 
The relocated FAC in Waianae officially reopened on March 18, 2024.  From July 1, 2023, to 
June 30, 2024, the new FAC achieved a 100% housing placement rate by transitioning all eight 
families it served into permanent housing.  On average, the FAC in Waianae transitioned 
families into permanent housing within 77 days, or just under three months. 
 
In 2019, the Legislature passed Act 62, with an appropriated $800,000 for the operation of a 
second FAC.  DHS procured the services for a second FAC, operated by Neighborhood Place of 
Puna.  This center can accommodate up to 9 families (up to 27 people) at any one time.  This 
FAC was the first of its kind on a neighbor island.  From July 1, 2022, to June 30, 2023, the Puna 
FAC transitioned 21 of 32 families into permanent housing, achieving a 66% placement rate.  
Families moved into permanent housing within an average of 89 days or just under three 
months.  From July 1, 2023, to June 30, 2024, the FAC of Puna successfully transitioned 20 of 33 
families into permanent housing, achieving a 66% placement rate.  Families were moved into 
permanent housing in an average of 77 days, just under three months, which represents a 12-
day improvement over the previous year’s average.  In the last five years of operation, the Puna 
FAC served a total of 200 households, placed 49% into permanent housing, and increased the 
income for 54% of families served. 
 
A key benefit of the FACs is the focus on placements into permanent housing.  Additionally, 
FACs address the social determinants of health and provide case management services with an 
emphasis on building social capital.  Social capital can be described as increased peer support 
and a sense of community; connections to family, friends, and neighbors; participation in 
community and faith-based organizations; school and workplace connections; leadership and 
professional development programs; engagement with case managers or career coaches; and 
other social networks.  It produces information, emotional or financial support, and/or other 
resources.  Research shows that individuals with higher levels of social capital are happier and 
healthier, find better jobs, and live longer.  Communities with higher levels of social capital 
have higher educational achievement, faster economic growth, and less crime. 
 
The requested level of funding will support the continued operation of both the Waianae and 
Puna FACs.  While the FAC program targets homeless families with minor children, it is just one 
piece of a larger state strategy that includes other interventions (e.g., street outreach, rapid re-
housing, etc.) that address the broader population of homeless persons, including homeless 
youth and chronically homeless adults.

224HS-02: Funds for Housing First Program 
This request will sustain funding for the state Housing First program, which focuses on the most 
visible, chronically homeless population - the same population who frequently utilize 
healthcare services and cycles in and out of the criminal justice system.  Supportive case 
management services are key to moving chronically homeless individuals off of the streets, 
ensuring that they remain successfully housed, and reducing the utilization of high-cost 
emergency room services.  The Housing First program provides housing and supportive case 
management services with an emphasis on building the social capital of unsheltered, 
chronically homeless persons.  DHS currently contracts for state Housing First services in each 
major County - on Oahu, Hawaii island, Maui, and Kauai.  These services would be adversely 
impacted if funding for state Housing First is not sustained.  In particular, the clients who are 
currently in the program will likely be displaced back to homelessness if these supportive 
services are not continued. 
 
The state Housing First program has been active on Oahu for more than nine years and on the 
neighbor islands for more than seven years.  Currently, the program supports 258 chronically 
homeless individuals, boasting a housing retention rate of 91%, well above the national average 
of 80%.   
 
Between June 27, 2023, and June 26, 2024, the program successfully transitioned 36 individuals 
to permanent housing through its Move On strategy.  The Moving On strategy is a framework 
designed to help individuals transition from Housing First programs while ensuring their 
continued success and mobility.  It focuses on increasing program capacity by freeing up 
Housing First units for those in greater need and supporting tenant choice by acknowledging 
that the Housing First program may not be the final destination for everyone, thereby enabling 
more people to move on to other housing options. 
 
Historically, the state Housing First program has been funded on a year-to-year basis except 
during Legislature Session 2023, wherein it was funded for the 2023-2025 fiscal biennium.  It is 
critical that funding be recurring and sustained in the base budget.  Without sustained funding, 
the individuals who are currently housed in the program will be at immediate risk and will likely 
return to homelessness as program participants require supportive case management to 
remain housed.  Investment in a Housing First program keeps people housed (91% retention 
rate) and results in significant public cost savings over time.  A preliminary analysis by the 
University of Hawaii Center on the Family of a subset of state Housing First clients found that 
estimated healthcare costs for clients dropped an average of 43% in just six months following 
housing placement – from an average of $10,570 per client per month to $5,980 per client per 
month.   
 
Social capital is another component addressed through Housing First services.  Social capital can 
be described as increased peer support and a sense of community; connections to family, 
friends, and neighbors; participation in community and faith-based organizations; school and

workplace connections; leadership and professional development programs; engagement with 
case managers; and other social networks.  Individuals with positive social connections have 
access to information, emotional or financial support, and/or other resources.  Research shows 
that individuals with higher levels of social capital are happier and healthier, find better jobs, 
and live longer.  Further, communities with higher levels of social capital have higher 
educational achievement, faster economic growth, and less crime. 
 
While the state Housing First program targets the chronically homeless, it is one piece of a 
larger state strategy, which includes other interventions (e.g., street outreach, rapid re-housing, 
etc.) that address the broader population of homeless persons, including homeless youth and 
families. 
 
 
224HS-03: Funds for Outreach and Civil Legal Services 
This request will sustain funding for the Homeless Outreach and Civil Legal Services program. 
Homeless Outreach is the primary method for identifying and assisting unsheltered homeless 
individuals and connecting them to other homeless services, such as shelter, Housing First, 
Rapid Re-Housing, and other interventions to help them transition off the streets or other 
public lands.   
This outreach effort is closely integrated with enforcement actions targeting visible homeless 
encampments on public lands.  To prevent merely displacing individuals, outreach providers 
collaborate with state agencies to move unsheltered persons into long-term housing solutions.   
Additionally, civil legal services enable outreach and other service providers to obtain 
identification documents for individuals experiencing homelessness who need state-issued 
identification to access housing and employment.  Sustained, year-round funding is crucial for 
maintaining and expanding outreach and civil legal services, as inconsistent funding could 
hinder efforts to manage the increasing number of unsheltered individuals.   
Outreach services include helping individuals obtain identification documents, find suitable 
housing, assist with job searches, and apply for public benefits.  Building strong relationships 
with those who have previously avoided services, outreach staff play a key role in connecting 
people to essential resources, addressing immediate needs, and ultimately reducing the 
negative impacts of rough sleeping and vagrancy arrests.  If homeless outreach and civil legal 
services are not sustained, this will dilute the state's ability to respond to unsheltered 
individuals and make it more challenging to maintain a focus on reducing unsheltered 
homelessness. 
Since FY18, homeless outreach services have been provided to an average of 2,976 individuals 
each year, with 382 individuals, on average, placed into permanent housing from the streets. 
On average, another 1,718 individuals were placed into appropriate settings such as homeless

shelters. Outreach performance and outcome measures target 15% or less for a return to 
homelessness, and Outreach services have exceeded expectations with an average rate of 
10.47%. 
Civil legal services assisted an average of 732 individuals each year since FY18, with an 84.5% 
success rate in obtaining vital documents and identification cards.  From June 15, 2023, to June 
14, 2024, civil legal services successfully secured 616 vital documents for 756 individuals, 
achieving an 81.4% success rate. 
Homeless outreach and civil legal services reflect a 'Housing First' approach to ending 
homelessness and remain a critical and challenging component of our current care system.  
While the Homeless Outreach and Civil Legal Services program specifically targets unsheltered 
homelessness, it is one piece of a larger state strategy, which includes other interventions (e.g., 
Family Assessment Centers, Housing First, rapid re-housing, etc.) that address the broader 
population of homeless persons that include homeless youth and families. 
Like the other strategies, this performance measure is aligned with the implementation of the 
DHS 'Ohana Nui strategy, which emphasizes building social capital as one of the pillars of the 
social determinants of health.  Consistent with the 'Ohana Nui strategy, homeless outreach 
services address the social determinants of health and provide case management services with 
an emphasis on building social capital.  Social capital can be described as increased peer 
support and a sense of community; connections to family, friends, and neighbors; participation 
in community and faith-based organizations; school and workplace connections; leadership and 
professional development programs; engagement with case managers; and other social 
networks.  It produces information, emotional or financial support, and/or other resources.  
Research shows that individuals with higher levels of social capital are happier and healthier, 
obtain permanent housing, find better jobs, and live longer.  Further, communities with higher 
levels of social capital have higher educational achievement, faster economic growth, and less 
crime. 
As noted above, homelessness remains a persistent and pressing issue facing Hawaii.  
Additionally, the demand for homeless services has steadily increased from 2022 to the 
present, reflecting the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.  During this period, the 
number of homeless individuals per the annual statewide Point in Time Count increased by 7% 
from 5,967 to 6,389.  Based on a review of data following the 2009 economic recession, 
homelessness is projected to continue steadily increasing for the next several years and is 
expected to impact both single adults and families with minor children.  Specifically, between 
2009 and 2016, the number of people experiencing homelessness increased from 5,782 to a 
high of 7,921, a 37% increase over the 7 years.  Accordingly, there is a need to sustain effective 
homeless services that emphasize placement into permanent housing to mitigate future 
increases in the number of individuals and families experiencing homelessness.

224HS-04: Funds for Rapid Re-Housing Program 
This request will sustain funding for the Rapid Re-Housing (RRH) program.  RRH is a nationally 
recognized best practice, and its core components are housing identification and location 
services, time-limited move-in and rental assistance, and short-term case management and 
services.  The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has long endorsed 
this practice as an effective way to end homelessness among families with minor children.   
 
In particular, RRH plays a key role in helping to maximize space in homeless shelters by 
targeting individuals and families currently staying in shelters and providing them additional 
support to quickly transition to more permanent housing.  By targeting homeless individuals 
and families who are currently in shelters, the RRH program accelerates the placement of 
families with children into more permanent housing and allows the state to maximize its 
existing shelter inventory.   
 
Currently, many family shelters are at maximum capacity and are experiencing a "backlog" 
because families are challenged to move quickly from homelessness to being housed with 
stability.  RRH assists in moving families much more quickly through shelter and into permanent 
housing.  For example, if a family came into a shelter with a dedicated source of income but 
without enough savings to afford the first month's rent and move-in costs, the RRH program 
could assess the family's sustainability and provide the financial support immediately to have 
the family either avoid entering or at least limit the amount of time spent in a homeless shelter.  
This approach is especially important for rural and neighbor island communities, which have 
limited shelter space.  In addition, this use of RRH recognizes that it is extremely cost-intensive 
to construct and fund additional homeless shelters and that the construction of new shelters is 
inconsistent with national best-practice approaches to addressing homelessness that minimize 
the number of interim transitions from homelessness to permanent housing.   
 
In addition to supporting homeless individuals and families with rental assistance and 
placement into housing, RRH also provides supportive services to assist a family in maintaining 
their housing.  If a family encounters difficulties with paying rent shortly after moving to 
permanent housing, the RRH program connects the family with appropriate resources and 
support to stabilize and maintain their permanent housing.  In this way, Rapid Re-Housing is 
effective in ending and preventing homelessness. 
The state's Rapid Re-Housing program has served an average of 1,468 individuals in 591 
households each year since FY18.  Between July 1, 2023, and June 30, 2024, 1,669 individuals in 
households received Rapid Re-Housing services, with a permanent housing rate of 60.7%.  This 
rate is derived from 1,014 individuals who exited RRH programs during the year.  Homeless 
Management Information System (HMIS) data indicates that the average duration from intake 
to permanent housing for individuals in RRH programs was 174 days or approximately five and 
a half months.  RRH services aim for a return-to-homeless rate of 15% or lower, and they have 
consistently exceeded this target with a rate of 12% each year.

236LC-01: Funds for Security Guards 
DHS Benefit, Employment and Support Services Division (BESSD) has processing centers, care 
licensing offices, and first-to-work offices statewide.  These processing centers house all the 
office assistants, eligibility workers, self-sufficiency and support services staff, human services 
professionals, and social workers who provide services and eligibility determination to most of 
our programs, including Supplemental Nutrition Program (SNAP), Temporary Assistance for 
Needy Families (TANF), Aged, Blind and Disabled payments, General Assistance Payments, Child 
Care, and First-to-Work. 
 
Security guards play a crucial role in the safety of all employees, clients, and visitors in each of 
our offices by ensuring a secure environment, and as a protective physical deterrent.  Their 
presence also prevents unauthorized access and criminal activity.  These contracted security 
guards work with the processing center staff to oversee who enters, exits, and moves around 
the facility.  With the presence of security guards, people within our offices feel safe, and 
employees feel valued at work, which boosts their morale, allowing them to focus on their 
work. 
 
Act 164, SLH 2023 appropriated additional funding for security guard services, though it is 
limited to FY24 and FY25.  The appropriation should be recurring and made part of the base 
budget.  The rate of security guard services has increased over the years, and currently, the rate 
per hour is $29.04.  With the re-opening of our offices post-pandemic, our lobbies are busier, 
and we are now utilizing a total of 28 security guards statewide. 
 
Below is the calculation for the amount being requested.

236LC-02: Funds for the Wahiawa Civic Center Move 
DHS continues to maintain a presence in communities around the state to provide services 
efficiently and accurately.  For the residents of Wahiawa, North Shore, and the surrounding 
areas, our Wahiawa First-to-Work and Wahiawa Processing Center will soon be co-located in 
the new Wahiawa Civic Center.  This move will allow DHS to maximize the use of our allotted 
space and provide streamlined services to our clients.  The building of the new civic center 
started in October 2023 and is expected to be completed by the end of FY 2025.  With 
completion next year, DHS requires funds to move current offices to the civic center.  The civic 
center will also house offices for the Judiciary and the Department of Health. 
The funds being requested are to furnish the new space and for moving and disposing of 
equipment and furniture from the old offices.  It also includes expenses for the installation of 
phones and cabling of the new Wahiawa Civic Center, and the removal of cabling from the old 
offices.  This funding is required for DHS to relocate staff and all required equipment and other 
necessary items. 
As of September 2024, Wahiawa Processing Center and Wahiawa First-to-Work are currently 
serving a combined 2,727 households.  There will be 23 employees from the Processing Center 
and First to Work office that will be consolidated at the Wahiawa Civic Center.  Failure to fund 
the move may adversely impact operations for Wahiawa and impact the 2,700 clients receiving 
financial and SNAP benefits or receiving First to Work services.

the positions to address the division's staffing needs. 
 
Transferring the five positions will enable the division to function more efficiently and will 
support compliance with federal regulations.  The positions will also support more timely and 
accurate processing of public benefits, thereby improving services for clients and reducing the 
risk of federal penalties related to delays in timeliness and increases in payment errors.

action for not meeting federal timeliness standards for SNAP.  The five positions listed below 
will support increased efficiency in the overall operations of the BESSD, increase capacity to 
respond to and comply with federal requirements regarding program integrity and restitution 
of overpayments, and enable the SB to refine outreach, the call center, and business processes 
to increase timeliness and reduce instances of payment error in benefit processing.  
 
Purchasing Tech II 
BESSD Administrative Management Services Office (AMSO) and Support Services Office (SSO) 
had a Purchasing Technician position that was defunded in FY21 and unfortunately abolished in 
FY22.  This position is very crucial as it is the only purchasing technician for our division.  The 
position is responsible for purchasing supplies and equipment for the entire Division.  The 
position also reviews supplies and equipment requests from the Statewide Branch (SB) and 
recommends approval/disapproval or suggests alternatives/substitutes to the Staff Services 
Supervisor; conducts procurement of leased equipment such as multi-function devices, postage 
machines, and monthly air conditioning maintenance for SB units; assists in processing 
pCard/Purchase Orders (PO)’s and invoices for security guards, courier services, janitorial 
services, telephones, etc., assists with units' moves to other offices, and contacts the various 
vendors for moving services, equipment disposals, etc.  The Purchasing Tech position also 
processes inventory paperwork for the Division administrator's signature.  Since we currently 
do not have a purchasing technician position, all of these responsibilities are added to the 
duties of the Staff Services Supervisor, alongside managing several positions at the central files 
office.  In particular, funding the Purchasing Tech II position would better enable the division to 
support the operations of SB, which provides direct assistance to clients applying for and 
receiving SNAP and financial assistance benefits.  
  
Investigator III 
The primary function of the Restitution Control Staff (RCS) of the Investigations Office (INVO) is 
to establish and implement the Department's statewide program to control and enforce 
restitution due to DHS because of overpayments and overissuances made in the various public 
assistance programs administered by DHS.  One Investigator III position in this office was 
abolished in FY22. 
 
The primary purpose of the Investigator III positions is to provide investigative services to 
recover monies due to the Department; locate persons of interest for other DHS program 
offices and other State Departments as requested; provide mandated support to the FBI Fleeing 
Felon Program; and conduct other investigations as directed.   
 
The workload for the Restitution Control Staff requires a minimum of three investigators. 
Additionally, due to the sensitivity of information in some of the tasks, access to the 
information is only granted to one investigator.  In the past, the workload was divided among 
three investigators to maintain efficiency, accuracy, and confidentiality.  For example, INVO 
receives an FBI fleeing felon list of over 1,000 pages, with at least 100 names on each page 
every three months.  The RCS Investigators must screen the list to identify individuals who have 

Department of Human Services

outstanding warrants and are residing in Hawaii.  Once they identify those individuals, they 
then must attempt to locate those individuals.  The tasks for completing this function are 
extensive and require the investigator to research various databases and coordinate with other 
agencies to verify and locate the individual.  
 
Other functions include, but are not limited to, screening restitution accounts for accuracy, 
providing testimony in bankruptcy proceedings, and identifying and locating family members of 
deceased account holders. With only one Investigator III, RCS would not be able to continue to 
function efficiently and effectively and would negatively impact DHS’s ability to fulfill its 
obligations and oversight requirements mandated by FNS. 
 
Outreach Manager 
As we continue to provide services for the most vulnerable members of our community, SB 
coordinates outreach efforts with various community partners.  There has been an increased 
demand for eligibility staff to attend outreach events to assist with eligibility processing, 
including Rapid Response with the Department of Labor and Industrial Relations (DLIR) when 
businesses shut down or reduce operations and community service fairs.  Outreach staff assist 
attendees with applying for benefits and services, conduct and complete interviews, and 
provide answers to questions about programs or case status.  DHS is requesting a position to 
manage and oversee this service provision.   
 
The Outreach Manager would ensure staffing for outreach events, coordinate with the 
community partners, manage the field operations, and troubleshoot during events (including 
supervising staff during events, providing clarification on basic policy and procedures of 
determining eligibility, and assisting eligibility staff as needed), create and maintain policies and 
procedures for SB Outreach, continue to build partnerships within the community and manage 
logistics and equipment needs for events and operations.  Allowing someone to focus on this 
important outreach effort fully will also assist SB in more fully developing its outreach 
coordination and activities.  Residents will benefit from services in their communities that 
generally take place during non-traditional office hours.  It is the goal of SB to eventually have a 
separate group of eligibility staff that would devote their time to outreach in the community.   
 
 
903FA-03: Add 1.00 FTE and Funds for the Summer Electronic Benefits Transfer (Summer EBT) 
The Consolidated Appropriations Act 2023 (P.L. 117-328) authorized a permanent, nationwide 
Summer EBT program that began in 2024.  Branded as "SUN Bucks" in Hawaii, Summer EBT 
intends to reduce hunger and food insecurity for children who lose access to free and reduced-
price meals through the National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program during 
the summer when school is not in session. 
Hawaii’s participation in the new federal Summer EBT program required and continues to 
require a 50/50 match of state funds to federal funds to administer the program.  Act 155, SLH

2024 established the Summer EBT program in DHS, subject to the availability of funds, and 
provided the general funds needed for the federal fund match to implement Summer EBT for 
FY2024-2025 that was used for the 2024 Summer break.  The inaugural Summer EBT program 
served approximately 90,000 children statewide by providing each child with a food benefit of 
$177 to purchase approved food items and address their food needs during the summer break 
period.  These benefits were 100% federally funded and totaled nearly $16 million in food 
purchasing benefits that could be spent at local food retailers.  Notably, each $1 of this benefit 
spent has a multiplier effect of generating $1.80 in economic stimulus for the local economy.  
This budget request completes the intent of Act 155, SLH 2024, by establishing permanent 
administrative funding for the continued operation of the Summer EBT program.  Act 155, SLH 
2024, authorized 1.00 FTE position in DHS to be the administrative and implementing lead for 
Hawaii's SUN Bucks program.  Act 155, SLH 2024, further appropriated funds for the contracting 
of the operational services and technical system development services. 
 
The Summer EBT contracts break down as follows: 
• $1,431,920     On-going system costs. 
• $1,344,000     Summer EBT/SUN Bucks Customer Service (call center & application    
processing); 
• $   500,000     EBT vendor costs; and 
• $   120,000     Notice printing and mail distribution. 
As mentioned previously, administration of this program requires a 50% state match.  Without 
the State match, the only alternative to consider is not to operate the program.  However, given 
the high cost of food, continuing access to federal nutrition benefits for school children on 
summer break is a priority to reduce food insecurity and child hunger.  
 
903FA-05: Funds for SNAP Smart Food Program 
Hawaii has an estimated food insecurity rate of 13.1%, with approximately 10.9% of Hawaii’s 
population receiving benefits from the SNAP program.  Food insecurity is associated with 
numerous adverse social and health outcomes and is increasingly considered a critical public 
health issue.  Key drivers of food insecurity include unemployment, poverty, and income 
shocks, which can prevent adequate access to food. 
Additionally, food prices in Hawaii continue to increase.   
To address food insecurity and rising food prices, DHS will implement the Smart Food 
supported by the Governor's office.  The Smart Food Program matches surplus food with local 
SNAP recipients.  This program will allow Hawaii food producers and retailers to make specific 
food items, including fresh produce, available at discounted prices to SNAP recipients in specific 
stores where surplus inventories are identified through a mobile application.  This virtual

marketplace will coordinate the offers of food as digital coupons to be shared with participating 
SNAP recipients.  Moreover, the mobile application will deliver tailored nutrition information to 
SNAP recipients to encourage healthy food choices.  The State of Delaware will be the first state 
to use this mobile application, and Hawaii proposes to be the next State to implement this.  
The service will be done via contract. The deliverable will be a mobile application that SNAP 
recipients could voluntarily enroll in. This application would provide them alerts of reduced-
priced food items and access to other cost-saving information, allowing them to have greater 
purchasing options with their limited benefits. 
 
 
903FA-07: Funds for Benefits Eligibility Solution Ongoing Software Costs 
DHS is currently working on the development and implementation of its new Benefits Eligibility 
Solution (BES) eligibility system, which is the replacement eligibility system for the 
department's legacy Hawaii Automated Welfare Information (HAWI) eligibility system.  DHS 
expects to implement the BES statewide in late 2025.  BES will be the system to determine 
eligibility, authorize benefits, and provide ongoing eligibility case management for the 
department's public benefits programs, including Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program 
(SNAP), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), Temporary Assistance for Other 
Needy Families (TAONF), General Assistance (GA), and Aid to the Aged, Blind, and Disabled 
(AABD).  
Previous funding for maintenance & operations (M&O) for BES was appropriated initially in 
2018 and was adjusted last legislative session to add $288,177 A funds and $255,500 N funds.  
While implementation was initially scheduled for mid-2024, implementation has been delayed, 
and the M&O estimates have been reevaluated to include additional ongoing software costs at 
$2M per year on a recurring basis.  The additional $2M being requested includes annual Google 
Cloud subscription services supporting multiple environments (Engineering, Development, 
Testing, Integration, Staging, Production, Security, Training, and Disaster Recovery) that are 
necessary for the BES system modernization. 
In addition to this request, there is a separate one-time budget request (above) for $10M in 
FY26 for BES development and testing, as well as a legislative proposal to request a $5.4M 
Emergency Appropriation (EA) in FY25.  The EA is specifically to reinvest a portion of a federal 
penalty for payment errors to build additional functionality in BES aimed at improving the 
accuracy of SNAP benefit processing and reducing errors related to overpayments and 
underpayments.  All three requests are necessary to support the full development and 
implementation of BES. 
BES is especially critical to address the FNS penalty for failing to achieve a SNAP payment error 
rate for federal fiscal year 2023 at or below the national average of 11.68%.  The BES will

include necessary functionality to reduce and prevent payment errors, such as an automated 
rules engine that will increase efficiency and streamline existing processes.  If BES development 
is not completed and does not have sufficient funding for ongoing operation and maintenance 
of critical BES environments, Hawaii will be at increased risk of high payment error, potentially 
delayed timeliness in processing benefits, and may be at increased likelihood of incurring 
additional financial penalties from FNS in future years.

802GA-02: Randolph Sheppard Revolving Account Ceiling Request 
This request is to permanently increase the revolving fund appropriation ceiling for DVR’s (HMS 
802) Randolph-Sheppard Revolving Account from $1,330,200 to $2,000,000.  Additional 
Governor discretion to raise the ceiling in increments of $1,000,000 as needed would also 
facilitate the administration of the Randolph-Sheppard program. 
 
The Randolph-Sheppard (or “Blind Vending”) program exists to provide quality employment 
opportunities for blind entrepreneurs licensed by the State of Hawaii DHS/DVR/Ho`opono-
Services for the Blind Branch (the “SLA” or State Licensing Agency”).  The Randolph-Sheppard 
program is mandated to continuously seek new opportunities for requesting to keep the ceiling 
for the Randolph-Sheppard S-350 Account at $2 million.  The account funds are used to assist 
licensed blind vendors statewide at county, state, and federal locations with costs of 
renovations, purchases/repair of equipment, supplies, vendor benefits, and professional 
development.  This includes new facilities, as well as providing necessary upgrades, 
renovations, equipment, and supplies to existing facilities, which can range from small sundry 
shops to larger-scale cafeterias on county, state, and federal properties.   
 
The income that funds this account comes primarily from the Honolulu Airport Settlement 
Agreement and non-assigned vending machines on federal property and is sufficient to 
maintain the budget at $2 million permanently.  The Randolph-Sheppard Revolving Account is 
used for these purposes, as well as the overall provision of management services, training, 
equipment, retirement and medical benefits, and travel for blind vendors.  The ever-increasing 
cost of medical services causes a need to increase annual medical benefits for the vendors.

appropriation ceiling was established in Act 109, SLH 2023, and not in the executive budget act.  
This special fund collects revenue from the Nursing Facility Sustainability Program, which was 
made permanent in 2023.  Expenditures from this special fund support Hawaii's nursing 
facilities through increased Medicaid reimbursement rates and covering the quality 
improvement programs. The program helps ensure continued access to care for Medicaid 
beneficiaries in nursing facilities.

appropriation ceiling was established in Act 110, SLH 2023, and not in the executive budget act.   
This special fund will collect revenue from the Hospital Sustainability Program, which was made 
permanent in 2023.   Expenditures from this special fund support Hawaii's private hospitals 
through increased reimbursements and supporting a pay-for-performance program. The 
program helps maintain access to care for Medicaid beneficiaries, and to improve health

AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY AGENCY 
 
This request is to sustain the increased reimbursement rates for most medical professional 
services (e.g., Doctor's visits) to 100% of the Medicare fee schedule.  Without this increase, the 
fee schedule would be reduced back to approximately 60% of the Medicare fee schedule for 
most of the medical/professional services.  This request makes these funds a recurring item in 
the base budget as funds appropriated for this increase in fiscal biennium FY23-FY25 were non-
recurring.   
 
401PE-04: Increase Provider Payment Rates for Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) Services 
This request is to provide recurring funding increases for Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) 
services.  The appropriation in 2024 was non-recurring.  In 2023, Senate Concurrent Resolution 
132, Senate Resolution 152, and House Resolution 207 requested DHS to take necessary steps 
to ensure adequate provider rates are established for ABA services.  DHS contracted Miliman to 
do the study, which was completed and submitted to the Legislature in December 2023.  The 
study uses a payment model based on an Independent Rate Model methodology, which means 
building the component parts of the rates from the ground up.  Key components of this rate 
study included outreach and engagement with ABA provider agencies, providers, and their 
associations, collecting provider agency cost and wage survey data, and getting feedback on 
draft rate calculations.  The rate study provided three scenarios (Scenario 1, 2, and 3), and this 
request is based on Scenario 1.  
401PE-05: Increase In-Home HCBS 
This request is to authorize federal funds to increase rates for in-home Home and Community 
Based Services (HCBS).  In 2022, the Legislature requested that the DHS study the feasibility of 
increasing rates for Community Care Family Foster Homes, Adult Residential Care Homes, and 
other Home and Community Based Services (HCBS).  As a result, the Med-QUEST Division 
worked with actuaries to do the rate study.  A key part of the rate study included stakeholder 
outreach and engagement with HCBS providers and their associations, collecting provider cost 
and wage survey data, and getting provider feedback on draft rate calculations.  Not 
surprisingly, the provider surveys showed significant wage pressure given the current labor 
market.  The rate study methodology used wage and salary data for direct care staff and 
supervisors, employee-related expenses, transportation and administration, program support, 
overhead, and Bureau of Labor and Industry Wage Indices to pay for employee benefits such as 
health insurance.  The final rate study was presented in December 2022 with three options for 
levels of funding - Low, Medium, and High.  This request represents the "Low" option for the In-
Home HCBS services.   
These services provide eligible members with daily living services and supports (meal 
preparation, cleaning, bathing, community residential, home modifications, personal care) that 
help individuals live in the community or in their own homes instead of in institutional (nursing 
facility) care.  The Legislature provided funding to increase the rates for all of the other Home

and Community Based Services.  The In-Home service increases, even at the "Low" option, 
reflect the competition for workers for this type of work (e.g., the hospitality sector).  Without 
the increase, it will become increasingly difficult to find personal care workers needed for our 
kupuna and individuals with disabilities wishing to remain living in their own homes.  If people 
cannot remain in their own homes, they will likely need more support in a more costly setting 
such as a nursing facility or other community residential setting. 
The general fund portion of this request will come from the existing general fund appropriation 
for HMS 401. 
401PE-06: Add General Funding for Death Benefits Program 
In 2024, Act 108 appropriated $277,600 to the DHS, Med-QUEST Division, to increase payments 
for the cost of the mortuary, crematory, or hydrolysis facility services for unclaimed dead 
human bodies from $800 to $1,600.  Funding was only appropriated for FY 2025, so this request 
is to include the funds in the base budget on a recurring basis to make this increase permanent. 
401PE-07: Add General Funding for Child Wellness Incentive Pilot Program 
This request appropriates funds to the Med-QUEST Division's budget for the Child Wellness 
Incentive Pilot Program established in Act 127, SLH 2022.  Act 127, SLH 2022, makes a $50 
payment to each state Medicaid benefit recipient for each completed well-child examination of 
that recipient parent's child, provided that only one payment may be made per child each year.  
Med-QUEST requested and received an appropriation in the Fiscal Biennium FY23-FY25 budget, 
but this funding was designated as non-recurring.  This program is established for five years, 
ending on June 30, 2027; thus, funding needs to be included in the Med-QUEST budget in order 
for the program to continue to make these incentive payments through June 20, 2027.

A modernized data system, with the use of current technology, is needed for Child Welfare 
Services (CWS).  CWS continues to move forward with the implementation of its HI-THRIVE data 
system (aka the Comprehensive Child Welfare Information System (CCWIS)).  HI-THRIVE is 
expected to provide the technological ability to access the system remotely, to be more user-
friendly, to provide real-time data for a more efficient way of doing practice, and a means of 
having more accurate data needed in decision-making and progress monitoring. 
HI-THRIVE is at the stage where the first phase of implementation should be in place by the end 
of Spring 2025.  Once that is done, it will be necessary to have funding to provide the 
maintenance and operations (M&O) necessary to ensure the computer system runs 
smoothly.    M&O will also troubleshoot identified issues that may prevent the system from 
optimal operations.   
The funding includes the costs for various software licenses, e.g., Adobe eSign, Oracle Rule, 
Azure Integration, Dell Boomi, etc., which are necessary to meet the needs of the practice.  The 
funding request also takes into account inflation and possible unanticipated reasonable 
expenses related to maintaining and operating HI-THRIVE, e.g., replacing incompatible 
equipment, updating current programs, etc.  The amount requested is appropriate given the 
current stage of HI-THRIVE and the size of the system.  Federal reimbursement for up-front 
costs is also available at the appropriate Title IV-E reimbursement rate. 
Investing in a new system is critical in meeting the demands of daily operations and provides 
the ability to access and use data more effectively.  Maintaining a computer system so that it 
operates correctly is critical to documentation and communication.  Without this funding, if 
there are problems with the HI-THRIVE, there is no immediate remedy to resolving it; CWS will 
not have a data system that is necessary to perform the essential protective services and 
effectively help the children and families we serve.   
There are no alternatives.  M&O is a necessary part of having a functional data system. 
301SA-02: Child Protective Services Shortage Differential for Recruitment and Retention 
The work that Child Welfare Services (CWS) workers do is vital to keeping children safe and 
thriving while working to reunite them with their families as soon as possible or find an 
alternative permanent home when families cannot be reunified. The CWS vacancy rate has 
remained at least 30% for the past four years, and efforts to decrease the vacancy rate have 
made little impact.   
This workforce capacity issue with CWS is a nationwide problem.  Without a shortage 
differential, recruitment and retention will remain challenging, and vacancies will continue to 
increase as more workers become eligible to retire, find higher-paying jobs, or resign due to the 
challenges of the job and working conditions.  Non-government employers can offer wages that 
are much more competitive than the salaries of positions in CWS.  Many critics of CWS point to 

Department of Human Services 
March 17, 2025 
Page 55 of 73 
 
AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY AGENCY 
 
the capacity issue as a factor in child death, poor and untimely assessments, and delays in 
reunifying children with their families.  Without this funding, CWS will continue to struggle to 
fill vacancies and retain experienced staff.   
The additional workload adds more stress to already demanding jobs, leading to burnout. New 
recruits also decline job offers to accept higher-paying jobs. The Legislature previously 
appropriated funds for a shortage differential; however, it was a non-recurring expense and 
only for professional staff, e.g., line workers in social worker positions.   
This request is to make the shortage differential part of the base budget and to include CWS 
support staff as well.  Vacancies of support staff positions are also problematic, and those 
positions are critical to meeting the expectations of all the work that needs to be done by CWS. 
While the professional staff does the assessments for investigations and case management, it is 
the support staff that arranges for medical appointments, transports and supervises visits, 
completes all the paperwork for travel, makes referrals and completes applications for services, 
makes copies of reports for hearings, and keep the physical files organized and up-to-date, 
amongst many other things necessary to meet the daily operations of CWS.  It is anticipated 
that to build and stabilize the workforce so that CWS can operate using best practices; the 
differential will continue to be needed in the years to come to increase the recruitment and 
retention of CWS workers.   
Alternatives to a shortage differential are to increase the salaries of the CWS positions or to 
offer regular financial incentives as recruitment and retainment tools.

Branch programs and is modified in small measures for APCS.  Due to the age of the system and 
because it was never intended for Adult Protective Service data, it has been and remains 
inadequate for capturing information that is needed both internally as well as for state and 
federal reporting.  It also results in laborious, ineffective, and time-consuming work for staff, 
who need a system that is responsive, portable, and effective for the work we do in this 
modern age. 
The UH Maui College Software Development Center is working closely with APCS and continues 
to develop a new, single-entry system of record with identified functional program 
requirements, including modularized components from intake to investigatory abuse analysis 
and determination, retrieval of information to generate protective service documents, and 
ability to retrieve and display protective determination evidence expediently.  We utilize 
departmental and contracted technical information technology (IT) support for the APCS new 
system of record, termination of data entry into the legacy system, and the ability to retrieve 
old data from the legacy system.  
APCS has relied heavily on the beginning phases of the system, built on a series of Federal 
Grants (CRSA and ARPA) awarded to the program.  Now that these grants are ending, we must 
continue to build upon the momentum and see the system-build project to fruition.  For this, 
we will need State funding for $550,000 built into our base budget.  We will utilize these funds 
to continue the progress in developing a comprehensive system for assessment, investigation, 
case management, referral management, reporting, and business intelligence.   
Many of the components are already in place, including the intake subsystem and a web-based 
reporter form coupled with auto-population of information into the APCS worker’s intake 
report, making the reporting of abuse and screening process more efficient and timely, as well 
as an assessment tool to identify clients’ areas of risk and needs, coupled with case 
management processes to reinforce that clients are supported with referrals and/or linkages to 
access needed goods and/or services.   
Without adequate funding, this important project would likely be halted, and APCS would be 
left without a system of record as the CPSS system is phased out.  APCS not having what is 
being requested may result in a negative impact on the most vulnerable people we service in 
our state, as APCS will not be able to access cases as readily, not be able to maneuver quicker 
to respond, and not be more mobile.  We respectfully request the Legislature's support for 
APCS to reach our goal to adapt and change our environment so we can continue/improve 
service to the public efficiently and effectively. 
The current antiquated system hinders the ability to serve and protect vulnerable adults.  APCS 
needs a system that is user-friendly and supports staff in performing their essential work 
efficiently and successfully.  The current system is DOS-based and limited in its data capacity as 
well as in its adaptability.  Very little can be done to improve upon the system to meet the

current demands; it is counter-intuitive and is very difficult to train staff to use, and largely 
inaccessible outside the traditional office space where it is housed with the mainframe system.  
The system lacks built-in logic, requiring staff to perform many tedious steps, such as data code 
entry and navigating multiple screens, to capture documentation of incoming reports of abuse 
and investigations.   
APCS needs a system that is responsive and understandable to the current workforce and that 
enables us to access information and input data outside the traditional office space. As social 
workers and nurses, most of the work we perform is done “in the field.” Without the ability to 
access information or input data remotely, our work is delayed and less efficient. APCS needs a 
system that supports our ability to protect vulnerable adults seamlessly, whether working in 
the office or remotely.

901MA-01: Additional Funds for Training 
Training is essential in building capacity for a stable and competent workforce. This request will 
provide the funding to enhance the training resources available to division staff. For the past 
four years, the Division has been trying to enhance the capability of the Staff Development 
Office, with limited success. Audits and comprehensive quality improvement assessments 
identified the need to provide a better curriculum to train staff regularly as one of the key 
factors in building staff capacity and competency.   
 
Despite receiving technical assistance to improve the training, the Division recognizes the need 
to seek services from external experts to train its trainers and create a curriculum that is 
evidence-based, comprehensive, and better suited to the needs of the current staff. Without 
external expertise, it will be a challenge to provide the skills and knowledge to move the 
Division towards a more efficient and knowledgeable workforce.   
 
Other states similar to Hawaii in terms of number of staff have training academies and staff 
development teams that are double the size of Hawaii's.  The expectation of the community is 
to provide the necessary training to staff so that they become more competent in the work 
they do.  The training will provide a safety curriculum, cultural training to serve families better,

legal training so workers can be more aware of legal rights, and enhancement of their 
knowledge about applicable statutes, administrative rules, and policies and procedures that 
impact their daily work.  Training to stay up-to-date with best practices must also be provided, 
as well as training on trauma-informed approaches and self-care to address the concerns 
related to burnout. 
 
Nationwide, states are facing a shortage of workers, and without the proper training and 
support, workers are quick to leave to find less demanding jobs.  This Division, which includes 
Child Welfare Services and Adult Protective and Community Services, needs to build and 
stabilize its workforce to keep vulnerable children and adults safe.  Training will assist in 
providing the skills, knowledge, and support to retain workers.  Without the enhanced training 
that this funding would be used for, the Division will be unable to meet the training demands of 
its workers and will continue to be unable to recruit and retain employees.   
The time to seek expertise from external sources to assist with and improve training needs is 
now if the improvements demanded by the community are to be met.  Otherwise, the lack of 
training will continue to be a problem that will be scrutinized by the public and put the State in 
a vulnerable position. 
901MA-02: Add funds for Security Measures for the Social Services Division 
Threats and harassment to workers in the Division have increased, requiring the Department of 
Law Enforcement (DLE) to provide sheriff presence in offices and periodic patrolling by the 
sheriff in sheriff's vehicles.  The Court also issued protective orders to keep targeted individual 
staff safe.  Additionally, staff have had to make police reports related to threats about shooting 
workers, written attacks targeting workers on social media, and protests being held outside of 
offices due to fear of harm and/or threat to their physical safety. 
 
DLE conducted an assessment of safety measures available, and additional funding is requested 
for the purchase of walk-in metal detectors and wand metal detectors, increased security 
presence and patrolling, panic buttons in each office, and software applications that can be 
downloaded on a worker's phone so that their location can be found if they need assistance 
while out in the field, doing their work. 
 
There have been incidents of aggressive clients walking right into offices to confront 
workers.  Protective screens at the front desk and doors with better locks, which can prevent 
the public from walking directly into offices, need to be installed in various offices to mitigate 
easy access to office spaces.  The funds would also be used to purchase and install security 
cameras inside of office as well as in the parking lots where State vehicles are parked.  There 
are increased incidents of state cars being stolen and/or tampered with after work hours. 
 
This is the first time the Division is making this type of request. It is necessary to increase 
security measures to protect workers so they feel safe and comfortable while working in the

office and out in the field. If workers do not feel safe, they may look for employment 
elsewhere, which is detrimental to the work that needs to be done and increases the workloads 
and stress of the remaining staff.

777HH-01: Add Funding for Kauhale 
This request is for $50 million a year to fund the construction and operation of Kauhale over 
fiscal biennium 2025-2027 (FB 25-27). 
 
Despite necessary investments in outreach, temporary shelter, and transitional housing, the 
number of “unsheltered” homeless on the street continued to climb as of January 2024; 
however, SOHHS has since reduced homelessness in Hawaii by over 500 in less than one year.  
Bringing an end to homelessness requires that, in addition to these essential services, we also 
invest in new approaches to housing and healing people for the long term.  Without long-term 
space for people to transition into, homeless individuals will continue to cycle in and out of 
shelters and temporary spaces, waiting months and years for placement into long-term housing 
where they can heal and grow.   
 
Kauhale offers one such solution.  Kauhale or “village-style” housing is typically envisioned as 
tiny homes, prefabricated homes, or other modest, low-cost housing units with bathrooms and 
kitchens that are shared by multiple units.  Kauhale are more affordable to construct than 
typical transitional or permanent housing due in part to the use of existing home units and 
shared baths and kitchens.  In addition to lowering development costs, there are communal 
baths, communal living spaces, kitchens with shared space for cooking and eating, recreation, a 
garden for growing and sharing food, and other activities so that it will reduce the physical 
footprint of development and can help to foster a sense of community cooperation and shared 
responsibility.  A Kauhale could also be created in an existing apartment, dormitory, or office 
building, as long as there is a communal living space, a kitchen, and bathrooms.  When we build 
Kauhale using existing homes, apartments, condos, and/or office spaces, we reduce costs 

Department of Human Services 
March 17, 2025

AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY AGENCY 
 
significantly because we do not need to place other infrastructure like water, sewer, and 
electricity. 
 
The Kauhale pilot project was inspired by successful community-based efforts to house and 
heal people using communal design and operations.  Leading examples include Hui Mahiai Aina 
in Waimanalo, Kama Oku Kauhale in Kalaeloa, and Puuhonua O Waianae in Waianae.    
  
Kauhale can be created through partnerships between the state, counties, and private entities.   
For instance, a county may have usable land, private donors may be willing to fund 
construction, and the state may contract with a community organization to operate the village.  
Alternatively, a church may have land and be willing to operate a kauhale but need help from 
the county for infrastructure and from the state to pay for vertical construction.  The goal is for 
state kauhale funds to fill funding gaps rather than shoulder the full cost of kauhale 
construction and operation.   
 
The Administration is currently assessing the viability of Kauhale projects and sites.  Our goal in 
January 2024 was to establish a minimum of 12 Kauhale in the next three years, with six on 
Oahu and two (2)  in each of the neighbor island counties before the end of 2025.   
 
Today we have surpassed that target and have upgraded our projected target to 24 Kauhale by 
the end of 2025 and no less than 30 Kauhale before the end of Governor Green's first term 
(2026). 
 
To date, we have built 16 Kauhale within 10 months (January 2024 to October 2024): Waikiki 
Vista with 120 beds (Homeless families), Salvation Army Hilo with 25 beds, Middle Street with 
19 beds, PaePae Hou-Wilson Street with 24 beds (drug detox – rehabilitation), Village of 
Redemption (re-entry) 20/24 with aquaponic and hydroponic features, Fernhurst YWCA with 29 
beds (Women’s re-entry), HI Public Housing (medical respite), Cedar Church Kalihi with 26 beds 
(Kupuna & Medical Respite), Ka Malu Ko’olau with 34 beds (Windward), Pu’uhonua O Nene 
(built-in 2023), Iwilei FHB with 32 beds inside (Medical Respite) and 30 tiny homes outside 
(Transitional Housing), Iwilei Kauhale with 54 tiny homes, Iwilei Resource Center with 100 beds, 
Maui Medical Respite, with 10 beds, US Vets Waianae (60 beds for families and single Adults), 
and House of Redemption 2 on Halina Street (Re-entry). 
 
This is the list of upcoming Kauhale: 1. Youth Kauhale with 20 beds (First Lady Jaime Green’s 
vision); 2. YMCA Atkinson First Kauhale for Diversion/Re-entry with 30 beds; 3. YMCA Nuuanu 
has 72 beds, Housing instability; 4. 550 Halekauwila with 80 beds, Diversion/Re-entry; 5. 
Kaneohe Windward with 11 bedrooms, fully ADA-compliant residence for Medicaid, Hospice, 
and Palliative care patients; 6. Kauai, Mahelona, Homeless with 24 beds; 7. Edwin Thomas 
Building, Chinatown, 30 Units Permanent Supportive Housing for Kupuna; 8. Cedar Church 
Waianae, Homeless, 100 beds; and 9. YMCA Waianae, 25 tiny homes.

SOHHS has housed many people so far - approximately 563 people/beds.  At our current pace, 
we will secure over 1,500 beds for individuals experiencing homelessness before the end of 
2026. 
 
First Lady Jamie Green is a part of the SOHHS Team as she is currently working with our office 
to open a youth Kauhale by November 2024, serving 18 homeless youth in the downtown area. 
She and Governor Green have helped SOHHS in presenting a $235,000 grant to Residential 
Youth Services and Empowerment (RYSE), a nonprofit organization dedicated to youth services 
and empowerment, which offers emergency shelter for Hawaii's homeless youth. 
 
Additionally, SOHHS is in the process of partnering with other nonprofit organizations for youth 
kauhale, hospice, and palliative care. 
  
Construction costs for Kauhale will vary widely depending upon the design of the Kauhale and 
how much infrastructure and site work is needed for a particular property.  Some sites may only 
require renovations to existing structures or installation of prefabricated homes, while others 
may require new construction and installation of water and sewer lines.  Our estimate is an 
average capital cost per kauhale of $2.5 million, with a wide range around that average 
figure.  For 12 Kauhale over 3 years, the total cost would therefore be $30 million.  We aim to 
house an average of 75 residents per Kauhale for a total of 900 people housed.  This reflects a 
per-person cost of $33,000 to house an individual, far below typical development costs for 
housing a similar number of people.  
  
Operating costs for a Kauhale/ohana zone pilot program may initially be similar to operating 
costs for shelters or transitional housing projects of a similar size.  For example, transitional 
housing for 75 people costs approximately $2.08 million annually to operate, based on 
estimates from homeless service providers.  Total annual operating costs for 12 kauhale under 
these assumptions would be $25 million.   Note that some of these costs will be covered by 
resident rents.  It may also be possible to blend state funding with other sources of funding for 
Kauhale operations.   
 
We aim to demonstrate that Kauhale operating costs can be reduced over time as residents 
(with help from housed community supporters) grow their capacity to assume roles and 
responsibilities for aspects of village operations such as security, groundskeeping, maintenance, 
and community governance.  Increasing resident participation and ownership of village 
operations will reduce annual costs and their sense of ownership and responsibility.  At the 
same time, with stable housing, residents will have greater opportunities to increase their 
incomes through education and employment. 
 
This is a pilot program to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness and impact of Kauhale.  As such, 
there are no prior expenditures.

Key performance metrics of the Kauhale pilot program will be the number of homeless 
individuals housed, the number who retain their placement in a kauhale, and the cost of 
housing individuals in a kauhale compared to other alternatives.   
 
This is a new initiative that provides a complement to existing services and housing options.  
Ending homelessness requires investing in long-term affordable communities and trying new 
approaches, and the Kauhale pilot program is such an approach. 
 
777HH-BF1: Operating Costs for SOHHS 
 
This request is for the operation costs for SOHHS.  Act 164, SLH 2023, as amended by Act 230, 
SLH 2024, shows that the funds for travel, office supplies, cell phone line, miscellaneous other 
current expenses, staff training, and registration, facilitation or consulting contract, routine and 
maintenance of machines, office furniture and equipment are non-recurring funds.  These 
funds are necessary for the operation of SOHHS in FB 25-27.

collective commitment is the same: to improve the well-being of Hawaii’s families and 
communities.   
 
Our implementation of ‘Ohana Nui aims to make strategic, intentional changes that enable us 
to reach our commitment even more effectively.  Irrespective of people’s age, digital ability, 
financial situation, disability, education, or English proficiency, our residents need a 
government that understands who they are, what they need, and how best to deliver for them.  
As such, every interaction between DHS and the public is an opportunity to show that the 
government can and will deliver the services people expect and deserve. 
 
The investment decisions made today about how to shape, direct, and secure our infrastructure 
set the foundation for decades into the future.  We must proactively plan to ensure we are 
positioned to react to the economic uncertainty of our local economy, rising inflation, potential 
recession, and the financial stock market impacts as the economy eventually recovers, both in 
the near and long term.  Poorly designed, out-of-date, and inefficient government services are a 
burden to the workforce and the residents we serve.  DHS must also compete with the highly 
competitive private sector to attract, hire, retain, develop, train, and empower talented 
individuals who are well-suited and well-prepared to face the challenges that we will face over 
the next five to ten years.  As one of the largest employers in the state, we must take what we 
have learned from the pandemic and post-pandemic nationwide workforce and workplace 
trends to make the department and the Hawaii state government an ideal, modern, and 
forward-thinking employer. 
‘Ohana Nui is a proven approach that capitalizes on Hawaii’s unique multigenerational family 
structure and provides a framework for human service delivery that positions whole families for 
a chance at greater well-being.  Translated as extended or large family, ‘Ohana Nui is an 
adaptation of the national two-generation approach.  The approach addresses the needs of 
children, parents, and grandparents early and concurrently, resulting in better outcomes for the 
family.  Practically speaking, this philosophy requires us to tear down our silos, think beyond 
the limitations of funding streams, and work across divisions, programs, and teams. 
With the support of ETS and the IT Project Advisory Committee (PAC) throughout the COVID-19 
pandemic, DHS has proven that we can successfully provide digital services quickly and 
efficiently by using technology to power outstanding experiences, engaging with our private-
sector partners and nonprofit organizations, and collaborating with other state and county 
agencies to reduce the burdens of interacting with government by simplifying both public-
facing and internal processes to improve efficiency, and empowering the workforce so that 
they can best deliver services from anywhere at any time.  The primary focus was on urgent 
actions to keep our networks and systems up and running and to build additional capacity to 
increase our online capabilities to as many as possible.  DHS kept operating throughout the 
pandemic, maintaining access to Hawaii residents while keeping clients and staff safe.

DHS made significant investments leveraging emergency COVID and ARPA funds and grant 
funds from federal funding partners such as the Administration for Children and Families (ACF), 
FNS, and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to digitize several applications 
while increasing cybersecurity, antifraud, automation, artificial intelligence, and IT services.  
DHS has accelerated the adoption and use of secure cloud infrastructure and services to 
establish a platform for highly agile and responsive technical infrastructure that can easily 
expand and contract as resource needs change.   
As more legacy and paper-based systems are modernized and made accessible to the public 
over the internet, the outdated systems and technical debt accumulated over decades limit the 
effectiveness of government and our ability to implement modern security practices as we 
continue to increase our online footprint.  Continued investments are needed to provide new 
features and online capabilities, technology that enhances customer service capabilities, 
provides more resiliency in telecommunications and networks, and double down on 
automation and integration to remove wasted time in manual data entry and inefficient tasks 
that span across multiple systems so that the workforce can focus on delivering the benefits 
and services the public need. 
Cybersecurity - $500,000  
Cybersecurity management, monitoring, and detection tools and training for Security staff and 
DHS employees address data loss or theft, hacker attacks, and ransomware attacks to ensure 
DHS remains compliant with federal, state, and local requirements and regulations. 
Secure Cloud Infrastructure -  $250,000  
Secure Government Cloud subscription for sensitive or other protected data or systems  
Telecommunications and Network Redundancy - $200,000 
To provide multiple dedicated, high-speed network transport services between DHS offices, 
DHS computing data centers, and the public cloud services that DHS receives from Google and 
Microsoft. 
Antifraud and Identity Proofing - $650,000 
Software and Services that provide electronic identity proofing for online applications that 
minimize, detect, and help prevent fraudulent applications, block known bad internet systems 
and networks, and Antifraud Analytics solutions that assist DHS investigations to prevent and 
detect potential fraudulent claims for food, financial, and Medicaid health insurance benefits.  
DHS distributes over $3 billion each year in federal and state funds to support the nutrition, 
financial, and health insurance benefit programs to nearly one-third of Hawaii's residents.   
Software-based Robotic Process Automation (RPA) - $450,000

Software tools that mimic the mundane human tasks (i.e., eliminate double data entry and 
repetitive system tasks) to increase the speed and accuracy of data entry tasks between 
multiple systems within DHS and systems outside of DHS where programmatic or system-to-
system integrations are not possible. 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) - $400,000 
 
DHS has invested in AI/ML technologies as a result of the pandemic and the sudden and sharp 
increases in demand for DHS benefits, increased number of new applications and clients, and 
the need to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of staff.  At the same time, the state 
suffered from a shortage of workers due to a statewide hiring freeze, defunding of vacant 
positions, and a dramatic number of retirements over the past 3 years.  The AI/ML technologies 
use natural language processing and intelligent searching to process and present data that is 
locked in the unstructured text, like case notes in mainframe applications or transcriptions for 
voice and chatbots tied to our cloud-based contact center to better serve DHS clients. 
Customer Service Technologies that provide more client self-service capabilities 24x7x365 - 
$400,000 
 
Cloud-based DHS-wide contact center/call center software services, constituent issue tracking 
system for consolidated reporting and seamless transfers between AI virtual voice agents and 
virtual chatbots, emails and "contact us" form DHS websites, internal case or eligibility staff, 
and external DHS partners where clients can get information that they want 24x7, the help they 
need during business hours without having to repeat their story or situation over and over if 
they are transferred from one person to another. 
IT Consulting Services - $300,000 
The IT consulting services needed in support of the DHS initiatives and investment areas are 
needed to ensure that these technologies are effectively implemented, managed, and 
maintained while DHS works to recruit and rebuild its IT workforce and provide sufficient 
training to existing and new staff.  DHS, like many other state agencies, has operated with 
legacy systems that are outdated, unsupported, and unable to be enhanced or modified 
effectively.  The legacy systems are costly to maintain, and the workforce with expertise in 
those systems has retired or will retire within the next 3-5 years.   
Data Management - $800,000 
DHS seeks to establish and implement a formalized Data Management program based on 
industry best practices and frameworks that include Data Governance, Data Integration, Data 
Sharing, Reporting, and Analytics capability.  During the pandemic, DHS established a technical 
solution and platform tool that enables DHS to integrate, transform, or orchestrate the 
movement of data from one system to another, from one format to another, or with any

combination with a number of systems to build quick web interfaces leveraging the data, 
centrally storing master data records for reporting, and enabling secure sharing and hosting 
datasets in a data catalog.  However, DHS needs to continue investing in both technical and, 
more importantly, non-technology people, process, and organization practices to establish a 
formal data management and data governance program which will allow DHS to expand its data 
sharing capabilities as the state moves toward closer collaboration and sharing of data between 
state and local agencies, and providing more transparency of government services through 
advanced reporting and analytics.   
IT Workforce Development & IT Innovation Projects - $50,000 
The department seeks to invest $20,000 in IT Workforce Development and $30,000 in IT 
Innovation Projects as a commitment to the ongoing IT Modernization and DHS Transformation 
initiatives.  This annual investment enables the transformation of the way DHS builds, buys, 
delivers, and shares technology using modern methodologies and technologies to assist the 
department in improving the public’s experience with DHS.  The department will focus 
investments to help make our IT services more accessible, efficient, and effective by building 
and providing technology applications, platforms, processes, training and certifications for staff, 
and supplemental software solutions.  DHS will continue to build the foundation for digital 
transformation with a focus on putting users first, building, sharing, and using open source 
code, public and private cloud, and platform technologies, and improving upon our existing 
shared services, enterprise platforms, and security.  
 
904AA-03: Add Funds for Family Resource Centers 
Act 129, SLH 2022, relating to Family Resource Centers (FRC), is a five-year pilot program within 
DHS.  This request is to fund one full-time equivalent (1.0) family resource center coordinator 
position to 1) further develop and implement a statewide network of school- and community-

Family Resource Centers (FRCs) are safe, welcoming, and culturally appropriate spaces that 
support and strengthen families; utilize a multigenerational, strengths-based, and family-
centered approach; and provide concrete supports, activities, and programs designed to reflect 
and be responsive to the specific needs, cultures, and interests of the communities and 
populations served.   
According to the National Family Support Network (NFSN), FRCs play a critical role in preventing

increasing family engagement, which all lead to greater student success in school. The local 
statewide network is the Hawaii Ohana Support Network (HOSN).  
Current resources:   
Act 129, SLH 2022, $300,000 Family Resource Center for FY 2022-2023, for a five (5) year pilot 
project. 
Act 125, SLH 2022/Act 133, SLH 2023, $305,000 relating to incarcerated individuals for a child 
visiting and family resource center at Waiawa Correctional Facility.  Funds were encumbered: 
$274,500 ($305,000 minus 10% restriction). 
Expenditures in the prior year:  
Funds were appropriated through Act 125, SLH 2022/Act 133, SLH 2023 for a child visiting and 
family resource center at Waiawa Correctional Facility.  A vendor was procured in November 
2023 and awarded in January 2024.  The contract was executed in May 2024.  Of the $305,000 
appropriated funds, 10% was restricted under execution policies, and $274,500 was released 
and encumbered.  For FY24, family resource centers expended $219,950 out of the $270,000 
($300,000 minus 10% restriction) to develop HOSN, contract a vendor to establish the Waiawa 
Correctional Facility child visiting and family resource center, offer training, and purchase 
school furnishings to transform space into a family resource center.  The total expended was 
$494,450.  
Other relevant factors: 
The devastation from the Maui Wildfires and the continuing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic 
highlight the need for mental health services and opportunities to build social capital for both 
children and adults.  FRCs assist families by providing a safe and caring place, resources, and 
support to strengthen families, connect them to public benefit programs, address the lingering 
mental health issues of children and families, and provide family engagement for increased 
school readiness and academic success.  
Impact on program performance measures: 
The current target group size is statewide, and the current total of FRCs is eight (8) community-
based (aka Neighborhood Places), 13 school-based, and one (1) correctional facility.  Over the 
last two years, five (5) more school-based FRCs were started (only 5 in 2022), with three (3) 
others in the development stages (hiring staff and finding a space on campus).  One 
community-based organization launched a community-based FRC in October 2023, and a child 
visiting and family resource center started at Waiawa Correctional Facility in April 2024.   
Notably, a memorandum of understanding was signed in July 2024 among the Departments – 
of Education (DOE), Health (DOH), and Human Services (DHS), giving school principals the 
authority to create FRCs on their campuses in partnership with full support of the

Superintendent and in partnership with DOH and DHS.  As a result, principals are finding that 
FRCs are the added support teachers need for family engagement and parent participation on 
campuses.  As an example, one school has several students who are raised by grandparents.  
Those grandparents formed a group and call themselves the "kupuna crew" and are on campus.  
They plan and execute Native Hawaiian activities with the students.  Many of the grandparents 
also attended the same school when they were in elementary school.  The presence of 
grandparents on campus changed the campus culture.  In addition, the FRC offers concrete 
supports of food, clothing, and household items through community partnerships.  The FRC is a 
gathering place to meet and engage with other families of varying cultures and ethnicities.  
Previously, one of the schools that now has an FRC had tension between ethnic groups.  Now, 
families bring things to share.  They give as well as take items they need.  
Families with children find it challenging to navigate and maneuver through state systems for 
public benefits and seek help to meet their specific needs of mental health, parenting 
education, and further learning opportunities for their children.  Some parents experience 
traumas from their own childhood school experience.  FRCs bridge the communication gap 
between families and school faculty and provide parents with training to help their children 
succeed in school by increasing family engagement, which helps to motivate students to 
become academically successful, reduce chronic absenteeism, and increase graduation rates. 
In addition, the fathers incarcerated at Waiawa Correctional Facility are eager to learn 
parenting skills and healthy relationships to reconnect with their children and caregivers.  The 
partnership with the newly created Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (DCR) 
(previously known as the Department of Public Safety) and DHS is working well, and inmates 
indicated that reconnection to their children is a great incentive to reduce recidivism. 
Accomplishments: 
The Implementation Plan resulted in the FRC network governance, definition of roles, 
operational guidelines, and membership agreement.  Also, the three departments (education, 
health, and human services) memorialized Act 129, SLH 2022, with a memorandum of 
understanding that was signed in July 2024.  In addition, training sessions are offered on the 
NSFN Standards of Quality for Family Strengthening & Support, and Parent Advisory Council 
(PAC).  Additionally, courses were offered to train the trainers on the 5 Protective Factors for 
family strengthening and parent leadership (as a precursor to PAC training). 
HOSN presented at numerous conferences, meetings, and collaboratives at the local and 
national forums, including informational sessions for potential school-based FRCs, national and 
congressional delegate briefings, continued collaborative work with the DOE Community School 
model for Title 1 schools with principals and coordinators, and special focus on Comprehensive 
Support and Improvement Schools, which are usually the schools with the lowest graduation 
rates.  HOSN continues to host meetings every other month with the larger community of FRCs

and family strengthening organizations, Network Executive and Steering Committees meetings 
monthly, as well as individual school-based FRC coaching and monthly technical assistance for 
regional school-based FRCs.   
Procurement and selection of a vendor for the child visiting and family resource center at 
Waiawa Correctional Facility were completed and the contract was executed in May 2024. 
Waiawa Correctional Facility, including the men incarcerated there, built the center and patio 
area and installed a playground with a regulation foundation and padding.   
The contracted vendor is building trusted relationships with fathers who are incarcerated.  It is 
conducting intake assessments with fathers and families and has started conducting parenting 
classes specifically for dads.  They are offering virtual healthy relationships courses for teens 
and complete pre- and post-visit sessions with children and moms/caregivers before in-person 
visitation with their dads.  The pre-and post-visit sessions are aimed at reducing anxiety and 
emotional or behavioral issues and provide tools and resources for coping with the emotions of 
a visit with a dad and easing the transition back to daily life with mom/caregiver.   
Alternatives: 
If the pilot project is not funded for additional years, then children, families, and communities 
will not have the essential space, training, and technical assistance to help families address 
their concerns about their child when concerns first arise.  Having a trusted person to turn to in 
a familiar location supports the child's, family's, and community's overall well-being so the child 
and family can thrive.  Pandemic rules and restrictions resurfaced a more profound need and 
inequities requiring healing from historical and cultural trauma that was not adequately 
addressed prior to the pandemic.  In particular, the schools with FRCs are seeing positive 
impacts on campuses and increased family engagement.  Discontinued funding of the five (5) 
year pilot project would disrupt these nurturing and safe space avenues to seek family 
strengthening and mental health alternatives for students, families, and even faculty, who 
often use or staff the FRCs. 
Other alternatives explored in the past, including the establishment of a navigator position(s) to 
help families with complex cases of multiple challenges and needs, were suggested pre-
pandemic.  Vacant positions to set up this position were difficult to find or were defunded 
during the pandemic.  Social workers or case managers have been difficult to hire or keep due 
to non-competitive salaries or early burn-out.  For greater efficiency, state programs have 
moved from case management to task orientation to accommodate the increased volume and 
need for public assistance programs.  Lastly, the loosely formed group of state agencies and 
community organizations needed a way to establish FRCs at the state level.  Grassroots efforts 
are important, but determined FRCs needed more recognition, committed funding, and 
standards or a framework embedded into state law.

This request is to provide continued funding for the five-year Family Resource Center Pilot 
Program, which aims to establish a family support network and increase the number of family 
resource centers serving children, families, and communities in Hawaii.   
 
904AA-04: Disaster Case Management Project - Rental Assistance Program 
DHS requires general fund appropriations to support the department's Maui wildfire 
emergency management and long-term recovery response, including the State's Disaster Case 
Management Program (DCMP).  This request includes approval and requests for appropriations 
for eight (8) temporary exempt administrative positions dedicated to the Maui response, 
operations, and IT support and funds to meet the needs of survivors, including those who may 
also be ineligible for FEMA or other federal disaster assistance.  Specifically, this request is to 
ensure the continuity of the assistance and programs led by DHS for the first three (3) years of 
the Maui wildfire disaster response and recovery efforts.   
 
Six (6) of the positions are specific to the DCMP, which is currently 100% funded by a FEMA 
grant for the first 24 months following the date of disaster.  FEMA funds are expected to be 
extended an additional 12 months—for a total of 36 months of 100% FEMA funding.  Thus, 
while FEMA will fund the first 36 months of the program, given the level of devastation from 
the disaster, it is expected that this program will be needed for five years to ensure successful 
recovery for survivors.   
 
The remaining two (2) positions that require 100% general funds are for the administrative 
(including responses to Uniform Information Practices Act requests and attendance at 
meetings) and operations functioning of the state’s Rental Assistance Program.  This request 
will ensure the Director's Office continues to have staff and resources dedicated to the 2023 
Maui wildfire relief efforts to lead an equitable recovery. 
 
Significantly, DHS is the State's lead agency for the State's DCMP that provides intensive 
disaster case management for all survivors of the Maui wildfires.  At Governor Green and 
HIEMA’s request, DHS was the State's applicant for the FEMA DCMP grant, which is initially 24 
months of performance with a possible single extension of 12 months.  Thus, FEMA funding 
cannot exceed 36 months.  DHS was initially awarded $17.2M by FEMA on November 8, 2023, 
for an initial performance period from August 10, 2023, through August 10, 2025.  During the 
first year, FEMA has provided additional funds.  To date, DHS has received a total of $25.15M 
from FEMA to ensure sufficient funds to serve approximately 3,000 households for the first 24 

Department of Human Services

months of this program.  Currently, the DCMP has served over 5,000 individuals and has active 
cases for over 3,800 survivors.  Given the documented high level of need for recovery, 
additional funding for years 4 and 5 of this program is required. 
 
To immediately implement the DCMP and other Maui Wildfire response and recovery efforts, 
DHS created a special project for six additional temporary exempt administrative positions in 
the Director's Office to oversee both the DCMP and all Maui recovery efforts.  This special 
project was expanded and includes additional positions, including (two) 2 additional positions 
for the DCMP.  The FEMA grant covers the salaries of all 6 DCMP positions, including the DCMP 
Director ($150,216), DCMP Administrator ($113,940), DCMP Financial Director ($120,576), 
DCMP Administrative Assistant ($62,400), DCMP Screening, Eligibility, and Outreach Care 
Navigation Branch Program Manager ($76,788), and the DCMP Communications and Outreach 
Director ($109,992). 
 
The DCMP serves as a connection point for all other DHS wildfire response initiatives.  The 
DCMP includes seven Maui community-based organizations and up to 55 disaster case 
managers, as well as 20 Outreach Care Navigators, and all requisite support staff for a total 
program footprint of approximately 90 individuals.  The DCMP provides case management and 
navigation assistance for all Maui fire survivors and has the funding capacity to serve 
approximately 3,000 households—or nearly 8,000 individuals.   
 
Ultimately, DHS continues to strive to provide a program that is available for all fire survivors, 
regardless of FEMA eligibility, to assist in navigating recovery and identifying resources across 
all stakeholders to ensure all unmet needs of survivors that arose from the disaster are met.  
The consistency and continuity of this program are vital to support survivors' recovery, hence 
the importance of funding to ensure uninterrupted program operations. 
 
Now that we are in the second year of the program, we will soon apply for a 12-month 
extension of the FEMA grant.  However, given the magnitude of the disaster, we forecast the 
DCMP will be a three- to five-year effort. 
 
The Maui Emergency Response Director ($112,944) and Emergency Management Finance, 
Procurement, and Grants Manager ($109,308) will continue to coordinate the Rental Assistance 
Program and other DHS-led Maui response efforts that are not DCMP-specific.  Since the August 
8, 2023 wildfires, DHS has actively worked to address the immediate needs of individuals, 
families, and community providers.  DHS facilitated the state’s Emergency Support Function 
(ESF) 6 – Mass Care & Feeding, and at the direction of the Governor, DHS developed and 
launched the state’s Rental Assistance Program, in partnership with Airbnb, Global 
Empowerment Mission, and most recently with the Council for Native Hawaiian Advancement. 
 
Auditor VII: 
This position is necessary to provide audit reports to the Legislature and the Governor and to 
ensure that accounting, reporting, expenditures, contracts, procurement, and finances comply

with laws, rules, regulations, and grant requirements.  Reporting includes, but is not limited to, 
responding to Act 10, SLH 2024 
 
The Auditor VII position is essential to ensure the integrity and accountability of federal and 
state funds allocated for Maui wildfire recovery efforts and future disasters.  This role will play a 
critical function in safeguarding public resources and promoting transparency in government 
operations. 
 
This position will conduct audits of the department's financial, operational, and compliance 
activities.  Audit activities include assessing the effectiveness of internal controls, identifying 
risks, and recommending improvements to ensure compliance.  Failure to comply with federal 
grant requirements can lead to a variety of penalties, ranging from financial penalties, such as 
cost disallowances, interest charges, or loss of future funding, to program termination. 
 
This position will prepare audit reports that clearly communicate audit findings, 
recommendations, and management responses.  This position will also support the training of 
fiscal and budget officers to ensure compliance with laws, rules, regulations, and grant 
requirements.  This position will further assist in plan formulation for implementing audit 
recommendations, including as it may relate to federal grant opportunities. 
 
The Auditor VII position is crucial for several reasons: 
• Accountability and Transparency: By conducting independent audits, this position will 
help ensure that public funds are used appropriately and for their intended purposes. 
• Risk Mitigation: Identifying and addressing risks associated with disaster recovery efforts 
will help protect public resources and improve the effectiveness of disaster response. 
• Compliance Assurance: Ensuring compliance with laws, regulations, and grant 
requirements will help avoid penalties and maintain eligibility for future funding. 
• Improved Efficiency: Auditor recommendations can help improve the efficiency and 
effectiveness of departmental operations. 
• Public Trust: This position will help maintain public trust in the government's ability to 
manage funds responsibly.

SENATE COMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS 
Tuesday, March 18, 2025 
10:00 AM 
State Capitol, Conference Room 211 
 
in consideration of 
BILL NO HB 300, HD1 
RELATING TO THE STATE BUDGET. 
 
Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki, and Members of the Senate Committee on Ways 
and Means: 
Highlights of OPSD’s supplemental budget request includes the following: 
 
• Transfer Out Budget Line Items to BED103 $-786,875; -7.00 Permanent FTE;  
-1.00 Temporary FTE, to comply with Act 153, SLR 2021, to avoid the 
appearance of a conflict of interest and to better align two separate programs, 
Land Use Commission (LUC) and Office of Planning and Sustainable 
Development (OPSD), with their separate missions within the state program 
structure. 
 
• Convert Coastal Zone Management (CZM) Program salaries of 5.00 Permanent 
FTE from MOF N to A Funds:  
Reduce MOF N by 5.00 FTE and $663,329 
Increase MOF A by 5.00 FTE and $411,408 
 
o Background: From 1975 to 2009, the positions were general funded. In 
2009, the positions were converted to federal funding following a decline 
in State revenues. The provision of federal funds from NOAA were 
conditioned on the State taking active steps to restore State funding. 
 
o Outcome: Restores general funds for five staff positions, ensuring that 
50% of CZM’s staff positions are funded with State funding to help satisfy 
the condition(s) of the federal cooperative agreement, including one-to-
one match requirements, which maintains the CZM Program’s eligibility 
to receive its annual federal award of approx. $2.5 million.

• Federal Fund Ceiling Increase of $255,964. Increase CZM appropriation ceiling 
(N) due to Federal Grant continuing support and inflation. 
 
• Add $300,000 General Funds for 1.00 FTE temporary position and funds for 
Special Funds Project Coordinator and administration costs for the second year 
(FY 2026) of the Hawaii State Planning Act Phase 2. Additional funding is 
required to continue this multi-year process to update HRS 226 pursuant to Act 
36, SLH 2024. 
 
• Add 3.00 FTE Temp Pos and Funds in SPB $282,060; 3.00 Temporary FTE for 
filled positions (Pos. Nos. 124200, 124251, and 124288).   
 
o Personnel General Funds are essential to retaining staff who support the 
state’s Economic Development District (EDD) designation, which unlocks 
additional federal funding and enhances economic development and 
resilience efforts statewide.  
 
o OPSD won’t be able to retain critical SPB staff without General Funds, 
jeopardizing the state’s EDD designation and leading to the loss of 
associated benefits and federal funding opportunities.   
 
• Add General Funds to Restore Full-Year Funding for Permanent Special Plans 
Branch Planning Program Manager, $45,570. 
 
• Add 1.00 FTE and Funds for Statewide Sustainability Branch $35,508 FY26 
$71,016 FY27 to support statewide climate and sustainability 
coordination/implementation. 
 
o Background: - Established by HRS §225M-8 (Act 45, SLH 2020) and 
HRS §225M-2 (b) (9), the Sustainability Branch coordinates and 
implements climate and sustainability policies statewide, evaluates 
legislation, and advises the Governor, Legislature, and agencies on 
sustainability and climate resilience. Currently, the Branch has only 1.00 
FTE (State Sustainability Coordinator). 
 
o Outcome: This request would expand capacity to meet climate resilience 
demands.  While original Form A requested 3 positions to adequately staff 
a Statewide Climate and Sustainability Branch, the Executive Budget 
reduced this request to 1.00 FTE.  Considering the urgent climate 
adaptation demands facing the state, the Branch supports staffing provided 
by 1.00 FTE, but strongly supports the 3.00 FTE request being restored.

Executive Office on Early Learning's Position:  SUPPORT 
 
The Executive Office on Early Learning (EOEL) offers the following comments in support of H.B. 
No. 300, H.D. 1 and requests your consideration of the following budget requests. 
 
Expansion of EOEL Prekindergarten (Pre-K) classrooms 
The EOEL's highest priority request is for funds and positions to support the expansion of EOEL 
Prekindergarten (Pre-K) classrooms over the next biennium. We are requesting $5,027,927 and 
58 positions in FY26, and $8,236,302 and 108 positions in FY27. This will allow the EOEL to add 
an additional 50 classrooms over the next two years. Both the Governor's proposed budget and 
the House Draft provided funding for this expansion, and we respectfully request that Ways and 
Means also include these positions and funds in the Senate Draft. 
 
In 2020, the Hawaiʻi State Legislature passed Act 46 which established a framework and 
benchmarks for achieving universal access to early learning for 3- and 4-year-olds. The 
requested expansion of EOEL Pre-K classrooms helps advance our progress toward these goals 
and supports educational equity through priority enrollment for at-risk children.  
  
Since the passage of Act 46, the number of EOEL prekindergarten classrooms has grown. The 
EOEL currently partners with the Hawaiʻi State Department of Education (HIDOE) to administer 
92 Public Pre-K classrooms in 74 HIDOE campuses across the State. However, demand remains

high, with the number of applications far exceeding the number of available classroom seats for 
the 2024-25 school year.  
 
As the program continues to grow, EOEL also works closely with HIDOE to ensure children 
enrolled in our classrooms receive high-quality early childhood development and early learning 
experiences that promote Kindergarten readiness. We are happy to report that the program is 
consistently recognized by the National Institute for Early Education Research (NIEER) for 
meeting benchmarks for quality standards, and as of their 2023 report, Hawaiʻi is one of only 
five states that met all 10 benchmarks for state preschool programs. 
 
Family Child Interaction Learning Programs 
The EOEL also respectfully requests your consideration of funding to support Family Child 
Interaction Learning Programs (FCILs), which was approved by the Early Learning Board but not 
included in the Governor's budget request. We are requesting $800,000 in FY26 and FY27 for 
contracts with third-party providers of FCIL programs. 
 
FCILs are an important component of a strong, mixed-delivery early learning system, offering 
families flexibility in choosing the type of early childhood development and learning 
experiences that best meet their needs.  
 
They promote children’s well-being by supporting families in their growth as their children’s 
first and most important teachers. The programs provide activities and opportunities for 
families who may not be interested in or able to participate in more traditional child care or 
preschool programs.  
 
These programs are characterized by a multi-generational, culturally responsive approach that 
values and incorporates the diverse backgrounds of participating families. With a dual focus on 
parent education and early learning, they provide opportunities for children and caregivers to 
grow together. The setting often resembles a child care classroom, but with the key distinction 
that families are responsible for their own children while attending the program. Activities 
often include group circle time, outdoor play, and a variety of learning stations designed to 
foster engagement and development. In addition to these interactive experiences, family 
members receive instruction on child development, workforce readiness, financial literacy, and 
other essential life skills, equipping them with the tools to support both their children’s and 
their own success. 
 
EOEL strongly supports these budget requests which will expand access to high-quality early 
learning, advance educational equity, and help fulfill the state's commitment to universal 
access to early learning for 3 and 4-year-olds. We appreciate the Legislature's continued 
investment in our youngest keiki and their families and respectfully request your support of this 
funding.

HOUSE BILL NO. 300, HD1 
RELATING TO THE STATE BUDGET 
 
 
Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki and Members of the Committee: 
 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify on House Bill No. 300, HD 1.  This bill 
appropriates funds for the operating and capital improvement budget for the Fiscal 
Biennium 25-27. The Department supports this bill.   
 
We appreciate that the House Committee on Finance included much of the 
Department’s Executive Budget requests into H.D.1.  We respectfully request that those 
items as well as those requested in Governor’s Message No. 4 be included in the 
Senate budget.  The requests submitted in the Governor’s Message will aid in keeping 
irrigation water rates affordable for users and supports agricultural production.  
 
In the capital improvements program budget, we request that consideration be 
made to fund the Halawa Animal Industry Facility Improvements, Oahu project.  This 
project will modernize the veterinary laboratory and allow the program to perform 
various testing for animal and aquaculture diseases locally and support biosecurity 
efforts.  
 
Another important CIP request that was deleted in the House draft budget is the 
Royal Kunia Agricultural Park, Oahu project.  The funds are needed to allow the 
Department to subdivide 150 acres of prime agricultural land, which was dedicated to 
the Department of Agriculture via June 3, 2004 Executive Order (EO).  The Department 
regularly hears from the agricultural community that the availability of agricultural land is 
the number one concern to increasing and promoting food security in Hawai‘i. The 

Page 2 
 
 
 
development of this new Agricultural Park is a key opportunity to address ongoing 
community requests for agricultural land. 
 
Thank you again for the opportunity to testify on this measure.

FROM: 
Ed H. Noh, Ed. D., Executive Director 
 
State Public Charter School Commission 
  
Chair Dela Cruz, Vice-Chair Moriwaki, and members of the Committee: 
 
The State Public Charter School Commission (“Commission”) appreciates this opportunity to 
submit this testimony in SUPPORT with Amendments of HB 300 HD1 which appropriates funds 
for the operating and capital improvement budget of the Executive Branch for fiscal years 2025-
2026 and 2026-2027.   
 
As the sole authorizer of charter schools in the state, the Commission oversees the executive 
budgetary process for itself (program ID- EDN 612), and for all 38 operating public charter 
schools (program ID- EDN 600). 
 
Public charter school enrollment for the 2024-2025 fiscal year is 13,054 students, which 
represents an increase of 3% from the previous year’s enrollment of 12,657 (397 students).   
These enrollment numbers are based on the October 15th enrollment count which determines 
per pupil charter school funding. 
 
While the Commission appreciates the continuation of its operating budget and the increase in 
funding for charter school per-pupil funds, we humbly request that the committee amend this 
measure and restore the requests that were approved by the governor in the executive budget 
but not provided in the House draft.  These requests are: 
 
 

o Additional Teacher Differential Funding for EDN 612 
● Increase in general funding: ($465,000) for FY2026 & FY2027 
Purpose of request: To cover the actual costs of teacher differentials for eligible 
charter school teachers in Hard-to-Staff geographic areas and in Hawaiian 
Immersion schools. 
 
o Transfer of Teacher Differential Funds: $2,000,000 from EDN 600 to EDN 612 for FY2026 & 
FY2027 
• Purpose of request: To transfer reoccurring, budgeted funds allocated for the 
payment of charter school teacher differentials between Program ID EDN 600 
(Charter Schools) to EDN 612 (Charter School Commission and Administration). 
 
o Funding for Hawaii Keiki: Ready to Learn Expansion 
• Increase in general funding: ($1,050,000) for FY2026 & FY2027 
Purpose of request: To provide additional funding for the Hawaii Keiki: Ready to 
Learn program in order to expand the program from ten charter schools to sixteen 
charter schools.  The ten charter schools currently served are on four islands- Hawaii 
Island, Kauai, Molokai, and Oahu. 
 
We appreciate your continuing support of Hawai`i’s 38 public charter schools and over 13,000 
students and the opportunity to submit this testimony.

Committee: Senate Ways and Means
Department:
Education
Person Testifying: Keith T. Hayashi, Superintendent of Education
Bill Title:
HB 0300, HD1  RELATING TO THE STATE BUDGET.
Purpose of Bill:
Appropriates funds for the operating and capital improvement budget of the 
Executive Branch for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027. Effective 7/1/3000. 
(HD1)
Department's Position:
The Hawaiʻi State Department of Education (Department) supports HB 300, HD 1 with concerns.
For the operating budget, the Department is very appreciative of this measure as it funds nearly all of 
the Department's requests as initially proposed, as submitted by the Governor, and as passed by the 
House.  Nevertheless, the Department also respectfully requests the Committee’s support of a funding 
issue that is rapidly surfacing within our school food services budget.
For the Capital Improvement Projects (CIP) budget, the Department appreciates the Legislature’s 
attentiveness in choosing projects that are largely based on our priority lists; however, the Department 
remains concerned that the generous number of line-item appropriations may delay projects that 
require prompt attention.  The Department is mindful that its previous approach to implementing CIP 
projects was less than stellar.  As such, over the long term, a risk-based, proactive approach as initially 
proposed by the Department with lump-sum “buckets” in managing school facilities will yield better 
dividends in meeting the needs of students across all islands.
We are grateful for the Legislature’s long standing support for and investment in public education and 
are hopeful that the Committee can continue to accommodate our budget requests.
Operating Budget:
HB 300, HD 1 funds nearly all of the Department's requests as initially proposed in its flat budget, 

which the Department appreciates.  Yet, challenges abound in providing predictable, reliable, and 
adequate funding of public education.
Amongst the issues facing the Department, one is of particular concern: adequate funding to feed 
students.  The school food services program is facing a projected shortfall that has only manifested 
itself recently.  The Department requests that the Committee include an additional $20 million for Fiscal 
Year (FY) 26 and $24 million for FY 27 to avert the projected deficit.
To bolster the Department’s leadership capacity, the Department requested an Assistant 
Superintendent position, which was denied in HB 300, HD 1.  The Department humbly requests that 
the Assistant Superintendent position be added back into the budget.
Capital Improvement Projects (CIP) Budget:
The Department appreciates the lump-sum funding that matches or exceeds the amounts originally 
requested in HB 300.  The additional amounts included in HB 300, HD 1 to the Deferred Maintenance 
and to the Health and Safety lump-sum “buckets” will help the Department’s efforts to create and 
maintain adequate learning facilities for students statewide.
However, the Project Completion lump-sum “bucket” was not included in HB 300, HD 1.  This lump 
sum is critical as it funds construction management services and contingency costs associated with 
completing a construction project.  The efficiency and effectiveness of executing CIP projects will be 
greatly hampered without funding in this lump sum. 
Funding for the construction of Lahaina Elementary School was moved from EDN 100 to EDN 450. 
The Department would like to humbly request that the HB 300 funding amount of $131,000,000 be 
moved back to EDN 100.
Conclusion:
The Department is hopeful that the Committee can accommodate our budget requests, including the 
latest request for school food services.  A sound system of financing public schools is critical as the 
National Conference of State Legislatures has recommended:
Stability in revenues and expenditures is important for all publicly funded services, but in 
particular it is critical for education where wide fluctuations in funding levels may be disruptive.
Dramatic reductions in revenues for a period as short as a year may impair the quality of 
children’s education and have long-term effects on their academic success.
-Principles of a Sound State School Finance System, National Conference of State Legislatures
In addition, the State’s commitment to public education is enshrined in the State Constitution, Article X, 
Section 1:  “The State shall provide for the establishment, support and control of a statewide system of 
public schools . . . .”

The mission of the Department is to develop the academic achievement, character development, and 
social-emotional well-being of our students.  We are deeply committed to working alongside our 
families, communities, and stakeholders to ensure that every student can achieve their aspirations — 
from early learning to post-secondary education and citizenship.  This mission is at the heart of every 
decision we make and is the foundation of our budget.
Thank you for the opportunity to testify and for your continued support of public education.

State Capitol, Room 211 
 
 
Chair Dela Cruz, Vice-Chair Moriwaki, and Members of the Committee: 
 
The Department of Taxation (DOTAX) supports H.B. 300, H.D.1, which 
appropriates funds for the operating and capital improvement budget of the Executive 
Branch for fiscal years (FYs) 2025-2026 and 2026-2027. 
 
DOTAX notes the following highlights from the budget to support its operations: 
 
1. Add $338,150 for FY26 and $1,343,400 for FY27 for monitoring and 
maintenance of the Tax System Modernization (TSM) project. This request 
covers annual vendor price increases and the replacement of DOTAX's 
document scanners, which process paper forms and payments. 
 
DOTAX requests a correction to the budget worksheet for this request as 
follows: “$750,400 NON-RECURRING” should be “$750,000 NON-
RECURRING.”  See Budget Worksheet, Seq #100-001, at p. 656.  
 
2. Establish two permanent positions and add funds ($65,000 for FY26 and 
$205,000 for FY27) for a Perm Senior Software Developer (#26009T) and 
Perm Software Developer Supervisor (#26010T). These positions are part of 
DOTAX's long-term goal to retain its developers and reduce reliance on 
vendor professional services.

Specialist VI, Perm Program Specialist V, Perm Project Manager II, and Perm 
Tax Business Analyst. These positions will be part of DOTAX's TSM Program 
Team within the Office of the Director and will be responsible for overseeing 
large updates to TSM, ensuring updates comply with applicable laws and 
user needs, interfacing with the IRS and other stakeholders, and training 
DOTAX users and taxpayers on TSM changes. The TSM Program Team will 
be vital in DOTAX's efforts to join the IRS Direct File program in 2026.  
 
DOTAX requests that the Perm Departmental Program Officer (#26004T), 
Perm Program Specialist VI (#26005T), Perm Program Specialist V

audit capacity in the district office. Kauaʻi urgently needs an Administrative 
Assistant II to handle the district office’s administrative duties that are 
currently being handled by the Kauaʻi District Manager, Collections 
Supervisor, and at times secretaries from other districts. 
 
7. Establish two special funded positions in the Department’s Special 
Enforcement Section (SES), Temp SES Senior Investigator (#26012T) and a

OTHER COMMENTS
VIP would like to create two FTE 1.0 positions by combining a three-quarter-time (0.75 FTE) position with one three-quarter-time (0.75 FTE) position and one half-time (0.50 FTE) 
position.  This would enable VIP to more readily fill the full time positions.  Filling two full-time positions is easier than filling one 0.75 FTE and one 0.50 FTE position.  VIP operations 
would benefit from the addition of two full-time positions because these positions would be used to assist with the travelers to the State.  This will also enable the program to bring 
about greater efficiency within the existing resources.
This request fulfills the State’s attempt to cut down on vacant positions and to maximize the use of current positions without jeopardizing service to the traveling public.  In combining 
the three positions, the State would be able to hire two full-time employees versus three part-time employees.

The request covers increasing costs of DLE deputy 
sheriffs providing coverage at Honolulu Harbor and 
Kalaeloa Barbers Point Harbor.  Costs include 
overtime to ensure adequate coverage for port 
facilities.  If this request is not funded, we will need 
to reduce coverage including fewer deputy sheriffs 
per watch or no coverage, or we will need to 
transfer funds from other areas under this program 
ID thereby creating short falls for other current 
expenses.  This request does not cover salary 
increases.

JUSTIFICATION OF REQUEST
Hawaii Highways (TRN 511/DD) funding needs:
Oahu Highways (TRN 501/DC) Long Term Vacant Positions Savings:
The position's salary and fringe amount were not eliminated in the executive budget with the intent of utilizing the savings as warranted by the department.
Therefore, the Department of Transportation respectfully requests a trade-off transfer from TRN 501/DC Oahu Highways to TRN 511/DD Hawaii Highways $189,858 (B) in FY 26 and 
FY 27 for the purpose of re-establishing TRN 511/DD Hawaii Highways positions' payroll requirements.
The Department of Transportation - Highways (DOTHWY) has determined the current operations & maintenance staffing level is insufficient to meet roadway maintenance 
requirements on the island of Hawaii.  To help alleviate the the understaffing levels, the DOTHWY is requesting to re-establish the funding of payroll requirements for various front line 
maintenance positions that are currently un-funded.  
The maintenance positions generally performs pavement patching and rehabilitates shoulder areas; maintains and repairs structures and drainage facilities; constructs additions, 
alterations and improvements to highways as directed; maintains landscaped areas and drainage systems. Roadside maintenance includes mechanical roadside mowing; controls 
weeds by manual and chemical mean; removes litter; plants, prunes, propagates, replants, fertilizes and waters roadside landscape; cleans ditches, slopes and culverts; sweeps 
streets and intersections; installs, replaces, straightens and cleans traffic signs.  Roadway maintenance includes patching, resurfacing and rehabilitation work on pavements and 
shoulders; constructs, maintains and repairs structures and drainage facilities; installs, replaces and repairs guardrails and guideposts; constructs additions, alterations and 
improvements to highways; cuts, grades and constructs slopes, embankments and roadside areas; cleans, repairs and restores highway after slides, storm damage and accidents.
Per F.M. 24-10 FB 25-27 Executive Budget Request and the Program and Financial Plan for the Period 2025-2031, vacant positions since July 1, 2020 or older shall be deleted.  The 
Department of Human Resources Development and the Department of Budget & Finance had compiled a list for each department of budgeted positions that have been vacant since 
July 1, 2020 or older to be reduced in the FB 25-27 executive budget.  Furthermore, the Department of Budget and Finance had requested the departments to identify positions that 
were filled, in active recruitment and located on the neighbor islands.

The HDOT program will continue to oversee the permanent red light imaging detector system. 
Act 30/SLH 2020 established the Photo Red Light Imaging Detector Systems Special Fund.  The objective of the special fund is to deposit fines, and authorized the expenditures for 
the establishment, operation, management and maintenance of the photo red light imaging detector systems program.  It has been determined the anticipated annual collection of fines 
will not be able to sustain the program in the long-term.  Based on the Photo Red Light Imaging Detector Systems Special Fund financial plan, it is projected there will be insufficient 
funding effective FY 2028 and into subsequent fiscal years (FY29 - FY31) at the sustained level of $2.8 million per fiscal year.  Thus, anticipated funding amounts have been adjusted 
downwards in FY 28 to FY 31. To sustain the $2.8 million funding, legislation is required to transfer sufficient cash into the Photo Red Light Imaging Detector Systems Special Fund in 
FY 2028 and/or into future fiscal years, for the program to remain solvent.

We also have the following comments:
- The description is wider than what is included in the title, and thus, the 
title may need to be expanded or the description reduced to align.
- The scope of work does not seem to be predominantly CIP in nature, and 
may be more suitable for O&M budgeting.

Hawaiʻi Tourism Authority 
before the 
SENATE COMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS 
 
Tuesday, March 18, 2025

State Capitol, Room 211 
 
In consideration of 
HB 300 HD 1 
RELATING TO THE STATE BUDGET 
 
 
Aloha Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki, and members of the Committee, 
The Hawaiʻi Tourism Authority (HTA) provides comments on HB 300 HD 1, which appropriates 
funds for the operating and capital improvement budget of the Executive Branch for fiscal years 
2025 - 2026 and 2026 - 2027. HD 1 currently sets funding to $1 for each of HTA’s program ID 
numbers (BED 113, 114, 115, 116, and 117). HTA kindly requests consideration of the following 
operating and CIP line items. 
The economic impact of fully funding the Governor’s request for HTA, including the $6 million as 
detailed in GM4 ($75,397,189 in FY26 and $72,397,189 in FY27) will result in $336.3 million in 
state tax revenue and support 25,901 jobs in FY 2026.1  This is equivalent to $4.5 million for 
every $1 million of HTA Budget.  Fully funding HTA’s Board-approved budget ($80 million in 
FY26 and $87 million in FY27) will result in $345.4 million in tax revenue, 25,617 jobs, and will 
allow additional non-revenue producing but critical activities in Destination Stewardship to 
support a sustainable destination and progress towards a regenerative tourism model. Details of 
the additional programs are listed in the testimony below. 
Operating Requests 
 
BED 114 SEQ. NO. 100-001: $5,547,352 (FY 26 - $2,773,676 and FY 27 -  $2,773,676) 
– The loss of the $2,773,676 appropriation in each fiscal year significantly impacts HTA's 
ability to implement marketing and branding to ensure a globally competitive leisure and

business destination. Demand from domestic and international markets is expected to 
be soft, and there is a continued need for activities for quick return generation of 
demand, such as market saturation activations and co-op programs.  Strong marketing 
is needed to stabilize the domestic market and rebuild the international markets. The 
current FY 25 marketing budget is only able to maintain interest and awareness levels. 
Beyond the Governor’s administrative package, the HTA Board seeks additional funds 
for gohawaii.com website optimization and asset development which is critical as 
technology changes (AI) and this is a major marketing tool for all markets and for a 
booth refresh for IMEX (largest global meetings and events tradeshow held annually - 
provides an opportunity for Meet Hawai'i to connect with the incentive market and IPW 
(HTA's major international trade show that involves all of our international GMTs. 
Increase funding for marketing in China moving from GSA (General Sales Agent) to full 
service contract, appropriate funding for destination brand marketing for leisure travel in 
the Taiwan Market to a GSA. 
 
BED 114/BM SEQ. NO. 218-001:  (01GM) The loss of the $3 million appropriation 
significantly impacts HTA's ability to for branding and marketing to address the  expected 
market softness further into Cy 2025 and 2026. Overcoming market hesitancy to visit 
Maui can only be accomplished through continued contact, frequent viewership, and 
relationship building. Activities will focus on short-term activities to increase demand, 
such as coop programs and in-market activations, and campaigns to show what to do 
and see.  
 
BED 114/BM SEQ. NO. 218-002:  (02 GM) The loss of the $3 million appropriation in 
FY26 and another $3 million in FY27 significantly impacts HTA's ability to for branding 
and marketing to address Japan market demand that is expected to be down through 
2027 without intervention. Activities will focus on short-term activities to increase 
demand, such as coop programs, in-market activations, and campaigns to show what to 
do and see.  
 
BED 116/DC SEQ. NO. 100-001: Increase is to account for the 10% restriction. The loss 
of the $3,762,181 will significantly impact HTA's critical destination management and 
stewardship programs including: Kahea Harbors Greetings, a Destination Stewardship 
Opportunity Fund to fund Destination Stewardship opportunities that support the HTA’s 
strategies for destination management and regenerative tourism.  Additional funding is 
also requested for ‘Ōlelo Hawai‘i Project, Ma‘ema‘e Project, and Sustainable Tourism 
Project.

 
BED 116/DC SEQ. NO. 30-001: (Transfer in Pos & Budget Line Items fr BED 115/SS 
SEQ. NO. 30-001; BED 117/30-001; BED 118/30-001): For administrative convenience, 
HTA prefers a single program id. However, HTA recognizes the Legislature’s desire to 
direct funding.   
CIP Requests 
BED 113XC: For the fiscal biennium, HTA initially submitted a $20,000,000 CIP request to 
DBEDT. However, following the lapsing of $13.7 million in CIP funds appropriated under Act 
248, SLH 2022, and revised project estimates, HTA now requests $52,000,000 in CIP funds for 
FY 2026 to fully fund all R&M projects.  This increase will support planned Hawai‘i Convention 
Center (HCC) renovations scheduled for completion in calendar year 2026, during the center’s 
modified operating schedule for its roof repair project.

The DOH’s guiding principles include: 
7 
• Implementing and maintaining core public health functions, including assessment, 
8 
policy, and assurance, 
9 
• Satisfying federal mandates, including court-ordered settlements, 
10 
• Directing resources as problems that pose the greatest risk to the public’s health and 
11 
the environment, 
12 
• Dispersing appropriate and cost-effective resources geographically, and 
13 
• Providing services of last resort for uninsurable populations and where there is no other 
14 
satisfactory alternative.

the

H.B. 300, HD1 will allow SOHHS to continue the implementation of Kauhale initiatives across
the state. Currently, we have 18 Kauhale active across the state and have a goal to establish
30 kauhale villages by the end of 2026. This was made possible by the generous support of
the Hawaiʻi State Legislature which appropriated $33 million for FY25 for kauhale initiatives. 
These projects directly support and house residents experiencing or at risk of homelessness. 
The request for $50 million in the Executive Biennium Budget will develop new Kauhale 
programs and maintain operations, including critical wrap-around services for our unsheltered 
neighbors statewide. 
As the Governor’s Coordinator on Homelessness, I am honored to further the important work 
of this oﬃce and the administration for the state. In 2024, the Green Administration set out 
with an ambitious goal of housing and sheltering half of our unsheltered homeless population 
by the end of 2026. I am conﬁdent that with this request, SOHHS will further expand deeply 
aﬀordable housing inventory and supportive services for individuals experiencing homelessness 
through the state’s Kauhale Initiative.

envisioned as tiny homes communities or repurposed commercial, hotel, or apartment 
buildings, that respond to the unique needs of subpopulations experiencing homelessness. The 
model is built on the foundation of fostering community and responsibility among residents. 
Residents of Kauhale are provided access to robust wrap around services, including case 
management and medical care to build healthy and resilient communities that help people stay 
successfully housed long-term. This is what makes Hawaii and our kauhale initiatives different 
and unique. 
SOHHS appreciates your consideration of our request to further our eﬀorts to reduce and 
prevent homelessness across the state. Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony in 
strong support on this measure.

Parents and Children Together (PACT) supports HB 300 HD1 Relating to the State Budget. 
We submit this testimony as a member of the Hawai‘i True Cost Coalition – over 70 community-
based non-profit organizations fighting to sustain essential social services for our communities 
and as an organization concerned about our community, especially those struggling with 
systemic inequities. 
 
Service providers work under the most challenging circumstances and must have specific skills 
to both engage individuals and navigate complex systems. They must be supported by high-
quality organizations that are sustainable and state funding is an important part of that. State 
contracts that do not increase over time as operating costs increase make this important work 
unsustainable. Now is the time to invest in services that help people in vulnerable situations 
attain safety, economic security and good health. The social safety net needs your robust 
support. 
 
Founded in 1968, PACT is a statewide community-based organization providing a wide array of 
innovative and educational social services to families in need.  Assisting more than 15,000 
people across the state annually, we help identify, address, and successfully resolve challenges 
through our 20 programs.  Among our services are early education programs, domestic violence 
prevention and intervention programs, child abuse prevention and intervention programs, 
childhood sexual abuse supportive group services, child and adolescent behavioral health 
programs, sex trafficking intervention, poverty prevention and community building programs. 
 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify. Please contact me at (808) 847-3285 or

Aloha Legislators, 
My name is Dr. Matthew Brink, I am the CEO of Malama Pono Autism Centers. I am writing in 
support of HB300. 
Children with special needs such as autism are among the most vulnerable in our communities. 
Funding and support for children with autism has remained stagnant in the State of Hawai'i for 
over a decade and has left our current Medicaid rates among the lowest in the country. 
Medicaid has historically been the lowest funding source for autism services and as such those 
families are placed on waiting lists and denied access to much needed healthcare. 
With the approved legislation increasing Med-Quest reimbursement rates this year, a renewed 
energy has built to finally meet the healthcare needs of the most vulnerable in Hawai’i.  Without 
a continuance of this funding, these families will LOSE the services they just now finally have 
been able to access.   
Thank you for your support of the vulnerable children with autism in our community.  Thank 
you for your support of HB300. 
 
Respectfully, 
 
Dr. Matthew Brink 
CEO 
Malama Pono Autism Center

COMMENTS ON HB 300 HD1:  RELATING TO THE STATE BUDGET 
 
TO:  
Senate Committee on Ways and Means 
FROM: 
Tina Andrade, President and CEO, Catholic Charities Hawai‘i 
Hearing: 
Tuesday, 3/18/25;  10:00 AM; Room 211or via videoconference 
 
Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki, and Members, Committee on Ways and Means: 
Catholic Charities Hawai‘i provides comments on HB 300 HD1, the state budget bill, 
which appropriates funds for the operating and capital improvement budget of the 
Executive Branch for fiscal years 2025–2026 and 2026–2027. 
Catholic Charities Hawai‘i (CCH) has provided social services in Hawai‘i for over 77 
years, assisting 40,000 people annually. Our services target the most vulnerable in 
Hawai‘i, including elders, veterans, children, families, houseless individuals, and 
immigrants. As a member of the Hawai‘i True Cost Coalition, we stand with over 70 
organizations serving 500,000 residents. 
Community-based agencies deliver essential services but face severe funding 
challenges. State funding has remained stagnant for over a decade, and potential 
federal cuts threaten their ability to serve. Without action, critical services relied upon by 
Hawai‘i families are at risk, especially in the wake of crises like the Maui wildfires. 
We urge decisive action to secure funding for essential services through the 
Department of Human Services, the Department of Health, and the Judiciary. 
Catholic Charities Hawai‘i also strongly supports the following budget items: 
• 
HMS 224: Fund core homeless services in the base budget of DHS, including 
Housing First, Family Assessment Centers, Homeless Outreach, Legal Services, 
and Rapid Re-housing. 
• 
BED 160: Allocate $50 million annually to Tier 1 and $75 million annually to Tier 
2 of the Rental Housing Revolving Fund. 
• 
GIA: Provide $175,000 to Lanakila Multi-Purpose Senior Center to support 
education, recreation, and social services that enable seniors to remain 
independent in our community. 
Catholic Charities Hawai‘i respectfully requests increased funding to reflect the true cost 
of sustaining health and human services for Hawai‘i residents. 
If you have any questions, please contact our Legislative Liaison, Betty Lou Larson, at 
(808) 527-4813.

On behalf of Kahuku Medical Center and the wonderful people who trust us with their care, we extend our heartfelt 
gratitude for your support in previous years. We support HB300 as written and we humbly seek your support for the bill 
as well. Funding will enable us to provide quality healthcare and equitable access to our Ko’olauloa communities. 
We believe these capital improvement projects will significantly enhance our organization and help us achieve our 
mission and vision of becoming integral to the total population health of the communities we proudly serve. 
We hope these pictures, along with the assurance that we are excellent stewards for the funding you provide, show the 
absolute need, and will encourage you to support our biennium funding requests. 
 
1. $475,000- Facility Plumbing Upgrades- The cast iron plumbing, installed in the 1970s, has exceeded its useful life 
and requires replacement throughout the facility. Failure to replace these plumbing lines could result in the 
cessation of vital healthcare services, posing significant health and safety risks. 
    
 
 

 
Page 2 of 7 
 
 
 
2. $825,000- Facility Electrical Upgrades- Ninety percent of the facility’s electrical distribution system, installed in 
the 1970s, has surpassed its useful life and requires replacement. This includes panels, conduit, and wiring. 
Failure to address these issues could lead to the halting of vital healthcare services, posing significant health and 
safety risks.  
     
 
 
 
3. $175,000- Fire Safety Upgrades- The planned upgrades will encompass new sprinkler heads, fire annunciator 
panels, and valves. The existing equipment has exceeded its useful life and requires replacement. Neglecting 
these upgrades increases the fire safety risk for patients, staff, and visitors.

4. $200,000- Mechanical Pump/ Motor Replacement- Mechanical pumps are used to pump potable and non-
potable water, as well as chilled water for our chiller AC system throughout the facility. Pumps and motors need 
replacement. Failure to replace pumps will result in significant operational disruption throughout the hospital. 
    
  
 
5. $350,000- Solar Parking Lot Lighting- The existing outdoor lighting at Kahuku Medical Center has surpassed its 
useful lifespan and requires replacement. KMC is committed to enhancing energy efficiency and believes this 
project will contribute to Hawaii’s renewable energy goals.  
   
 

 
Page 4 of 7 
 
 
 
6. $875,000- Rothwell Wing Renovation- The Rothwell Wing, constructed in the 1950s, has not seen any major 
renovations since its inception. Currently, the ceilings are open, revealing wiring and piping. Planned renovations 
will encompass new flooring, lighting, electrical, plumbing, carpentry, and painting. 
  
  
 
 
 
7. $610,000- Dental Remodel- Kahuku Medical Center’s Dental program has outgrown its original five-operatory 
clinic and urgently requires additional space. Due to these constraints, new patient appointments are scheduled 
five to six months out. Additionally, the lack of space forces employees to perform administrative tasks in the 
hallway. 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
Page 5 of 7 
 
 
 
8. $650,000- Rehabilitation Department Remodel- KMC’s Rehabilitation Department currently operates in a 1,300 
square foot space that was previously two operating rooms. The layout is inefficient and requires remodeling. 
Planned renovations include new flooring, lighting, electrical, plumbing, carpentry, and painting. Without these 
updates, patient appointment wait times will increase, unnecessarily prolonging rehabilitative care. 
    
 
 
 
9. $350,000- Business Office/ Registration Renovation- Business Office and Patient Registration spaces are original, 
built in the 1970’s and in need of renovation. Renovations will include new flooring, lighting, electrical, carpentry 
and painting. 
  
 
 
 
 

 
Page 6 of 7 
 
 
 
10. $800,000- Wellness Path and Gardens- Kahuku Medical Center acknowledges the health benefits of sunlight and 
fresh air. To promote well-being, a walking path adorned with native trees and shrubs is planned for the 
enjoyment of both patients and employees. 
 
 
 
     
11. $2,650,000- Emergency Room Expansion- Kahuku Medical Center's Emergency Room is significantly undersized, 
treating around 800 patients each month. Due to these space constraints, makeshift beds and treatment areas 
are often set up in the hallways.  
 
       
 

 
Page 7 of 7 
 
 
 
12. $800,000- Facility Reroofing- The roof of Kahuku Medical Center, originally built in the 1970s, has undergone 
numerous repairs over the years and has now exceeded its useful lifespan. Persistent leaks throughout the 
facility pose health hazards, which can be significantly mitigated or eliminated by replacing the roof.

Testimony in Support of HB 300 HD1, Relating to the State Budget 
 
Senate Committee on Ways and Means 
Tuesday, March 18, 2025 
10 am 
Conference Room 211 
 
Aloha Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki, and Committee Members: 
 
Hawaii Dental Service (HDS) strongly supports HB 300 HD1, relating to the State Budget, 
speciﬁcally to re-establish the mandated State Oral Health Program which was removed in 
2009.  
 
Hawaii is one of eight states that does not maintain dedicated public dental health staﬀ 
responsible for assessing and monitoring the population’s oral health status, community 
needs, and infrastructure; oral health education; and working to reduce barriers to dental care 
as required by HRS §321-61 – 63. This statute states that the Hawaii State Department of 
Health must study and appraise the State's dental health needs and resources and shall foster 
the development and expansion of dental health services to the people of the State. 
 
Hawaii’s last statewide oral health assessment was conducted a decade ago in 2015, with 
Head Start data showing the highest rates of childhood tooth decay in the nation. It is 
imperative that we continue to assess the state of oral health in Hawaii so that we can develop 
eﬀective programs to help improve oral health outcomes, especially for our keiki.  
 
Preventable dental issues continue to drive high emergency room visits, and less than half of 
Medicaid-enrolled children receive preventive care. Investing in oral health will improve access, 
reduce costs, and create lasting change. 
 
Dedicated oral health staﬀ and resources at the Department of Health will help address the 
longstanding gaps in access to dental care and education and would provide the necessary 
expertise to drive targeted solutions, prioritize oral health, and improve outcomes for all 
Hawai‘i residents. 
 
HDS and the HDS Foundation urge your support for funding to restore the State Oral Health 
Program and help Hawaii residents achieve healthier smiles. 
 
Sincerely,

Re: HTH 501 Developmental Disabilities 
We wish to comment on this Budget Request 
Twenty years ago our office entered into a Settlement Agreement in a lawsuit that we brought 
against the Developmental Disabilities Division which obligates them to annually assess the 
needs of the DD population and make specific efforts to secure a Budget that will adequately 
serve them. 
We have reason to believe that they have failed to comply with the Settlement Agreement and 
have failed over the years to seek appropriate funding for the DD Home and Community Based 
Waiver. We say this in part because we have seen a growing decrease in the amount of services 
provided to waiver recipients as well as a tightening up of eligibility criteria. This has greatly 
impacted several of our clients. That would not occur if they were carrying out the terms of the 
Settlement. 
We note that while the current request seeks an additional 10 million dollars we have been told 
that this is allocated to pay higher rates to providers. While we have no issue with providing 
sufficient incentives to DD providers, what is needed are sufficient funds to properly serve the 
ID/DD population. 
We urge the Legislature to closely scrutinize the HTH 501 Budget Request and make necessary 
adjustments so that the State will comply with its legal obligation.

Hearing: Thueady, March 18, 2025, at 10:00 AM 
 
RE: Strong Support for House Bill 300 
 
Aloha Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki, and committee members,  
 
Pride at Work – Hawai‘i is an official chapter of Pride at Work which is a national nonprofit 
organization that represents LGBTQIA+ union members and their allies. We are an officially 
recognized constituency group of the AFL-CIO that organizes mutual support between the organized 
Labor Movement and the LGBTQIA+ Community to further social and economic justice.  
 
My name is Michael Golojuch, Jr. (he/him), and I submit this testimony on behalf of Pride at Work - 
Hawaiʻi in strong support of House Bill 300, which allocates critical funding for sexual and 
reproductive health care. This investment is essential to ensuring that providers across our state can 
continue delivering quality, comprehensive care to all who need it, regardless of income, gender 
identity, or sexual orientation. 
 
Investing in Sexual and Reproductive Health Care is an Investment in Our Communities 
 
The inclusion of funding for sexual and reproductive health services in the state budget is crucial for 
the well-being of Hawaiʻi’s residents. This funding supports clinics, community health centers, and 
reproductive health providers who offer essential services such as contraception, STI testing and 
treatment, gender-affirming care, cancer screenings, and abortion services. These services save 
lives and promote health equity by ensuring that all people—especially LGBTQIA+ individuals, low-
income residents, and those in rural communities—can access the care they need. 
 
The Cost of Inaction is Too Great 
 
Failure to adequately fund these services will have devastating consequences for our communities. 
A lack of investment will force providers to reduce services, close clinics, and turn patients away. 
This disproportionately impacts marginalized communities, particularly LGBTQ+ individuals, who 
already face barriers to health care due to discrimination, financial hardship, and geographic 
limitations. Without this funding, our state risks increasing rates of unintended pregnancies, STIs, 
and other preventable health complications, exacerbating existing disparities. 
 
Protecting Bodily Autonomy and LGBTQIA+ Health 
 
At a time when attacks on bodily autonomy and LGBTQIA+ rights are escalating across the country, 
it is more important than ever for Hawaiʻi to stand as a leader in protecting access to sexual and 
reproductive health care. House Bill 300 is not just a budgetary measure—it is a declaration that our 
state values equity, dignity, and the right to make personal health care decisions. 
 

Pride at Work – Hawai‘i’s Testimony is Strong Support of House Bill 300 - Reproductive Health Care 
 
For these reasons, Pride at Work - Hawaiʻi urges the legislature to fully fund sexual and 
reproductive health care through House Bill 300. This investment is not just about dollars—it is 
about the lives and futures of Hawaiʻi’s people. We ask for your leadership in ensuring that providers 
have the resources they need to continue their lifesaving work. 
 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify. We strongly urge you to pass HB 300 and ensure a 
healthier, more equitable future for all. 
 
Mahalo nui loa for your time and consideration.

Healthcare Association of Hawaii  
 
Re: 
Support 
HB 300 HD 1, Relating to the State Budget 
 
The Healthcare Association of Hawaii (HAH), established in 1939, serves as the leading voice of 
healthcare on behalf of 170 member organizations who represent almost every aspect of the 
health care continuum in Hawaii.   Members include acute care hospitals, skilled nursing 
facilities, home health agencies, hospices, assisted living facilities and durable medical 
equipment suppliers.  In addition to providing access to appropriate, affordable, high-quality 
care to all of Hawaii’s residents, our members contribute significantly to Hawaii’s economy by 
employing over 30,000 people statewide. 
 
We are writing today to strongly support continued investment in essential workforce and 
healthcare programs.  In particular, we would like to highlight an additional two years of 
funding to continue proven healthcare workforce development programs for high school 
students and current nurses. This request is largely similar to funding that the legislature passed 
in Act 89, SLH 2024, which has already been deployed to support these innovative programs 
that are critical to addressing the persistent workforce shortages in healthcare. In our 
organization’s most recent demand survey, we found that there are nearly 4,700 openings for 
non-physician, patient-facing positions in the state’s hospitals, nursing homes, clinics, and other 
healthcare settings. The need for entry-level positions, especially certified nurse aides (CNAs), 
continues to grow as our population ages. 
 
In 2023, the high school certificate programs supported 105 students working to get certified as 
CNAs, phlebotomists, medical assistants, and patient service representatives at 14 schools 
across the state. Students in the program saw a 98 percent completion rate with a 74 percent 
employment rate, a significant improvement from previous years due to the heavy employer 
involvement and wrap-around services. Over the same time period, the CNA to LPN glidepath 
supported approximately 40 individuals to continue working full-time while pursuing their 
education and licensure as LPNs over a year-long course that allows them to increase their 

 
 
salaries by 50 percent at the end and provide higher-level support in our long-term care 
facilities. 
 
Healthcare employers have invested heavily in these programs by providing clinicians to teach 
courses, investing in hands-on training opportunities for high school students, and offering 
stipends to participants, particularly in the glidepath program, to ensure they are compensated 
as if working full-time. Our organization has also provided significant staffing resources to 
recruit students, coordinate programs, and secure federal, state, and private funding to keep 
everything running smoothly. Importantly, for this program, there is a plan to fully fund the 
programs privately at the end of two years. This funding is needed to continue the momentum 
of the programs while ensuring that a permanent funding source is established through 
healthcare employers and other relevant stakeholders. 
 
We also support the loan repayment program, which is crucial for attracting and retaining 
healthcare professionals in Hawaii. The high cost of living and significant educational debt are 
major barriers for healthcare workers who might otherwise choose to practice in the state. By 
continuing to fund loan repayment programs, the legislature can help incentivize professionals 
to work in underserved areas and ensure that critical healthcare needs are met statewide. 
 
Another essential provision in this bill is the proposal to make permanent the increase in 
reimbursements to professionals billing under Medicaid to 100% of the Medicare rate. 
Medicaid plays a critical role in providing health coverage for a significant portion of Hawaii’s 
population, including half of the children in the state. Since the COVID-19 pandemic began in 
2020, Medicaid enrollment has risen significantly, with nearly one-third of all residents now in 
the program, highlighting its importance in ensuring access to healthcare for those most in 
need. 
 
However, many Medicaid recipients continue to face challenges in obtaining timely and 
adequate care, particularly from specialists. One of the primary barriers to care is the shortage 
of healthcare providers, especially in rural areas. In 2022, Hawaii faced a shortage of more than 
750 full-time physicians and nearly 4,000 patient-facing healthcare professionals, with the 
shortage particularly pronounced among specialists. A key factor contributing to these gaps is 
the disparity in reimbursement rates between Medicaid and other payers, such as Medicare 
and private insurance. Lower Medicaid reimbursement rates have discouraged provider 
participation, limiting the number of specialists who accept Medicaid patients. This lack of 
participation results in restricted access to specialized services, delays in care, and worsening 
health outcomes for Medicaid recipients. 
 
The legislature’s 2023 decision to increase Medicaid reimbursement rates to 100% of Medicare 
rates has already made a significant impact, helping to cover the costs of care for providers, 
especially in rural areas, and ensuring that more residents receive timely and needed care. This 
step also brought nearly $85 million in federal funds to support healthcare access in the state. 
Making this increase permanent is critical to addressing healthcare inequities, encouraging 
provider participation, and sustaining access to care for Medicaid patients. 

 
 
 
Additionally, we strongly support making permanent the ceiling for the nursing and hospital 
sustainability programs. These programs have been instrumental in stabilizing funding for 
hospitals and nursing facilities, which are critical to delivering care to communities across 
Hawaii. By maintaining these programs, the state demonstrates its commitment to 
safeguarding the healthcare infrastructure that so many residents depend on. While this 
provision is brief in its language, its impact is substantial, ensuring that these facilities can 
continue to operate effectively and meet the growing demands of patient care. 
 
We note that the current version of this measure would make both the programmatic special 
fund (found in HMS 401) and the administrative portion of the special fund (found in HMS 
902) non-recurring. We understand that there may be some questions over the status of 
federal health programs, and the ceiling authorized by the bill. We would note that the 
uncertainty at the federal level is a key reason why the special fund should be made 
recurring. Without this program, the state would lose the ability to use these provider fees to 
fund both programmatic and administrative costs without using general funds and use every 
lever available to us to appropriately fund services for Medicaid enrollees. Further, the levels 
authorized in the funding bill would allow us to fully maximize whatever benefits the state 
could realize from the program and ensuring that any available fees are used to draw down 
additional federal funds without having other rely on state general revenues. 
 
In summary, these provisions are not merely budgetary decisions—they represent strategic 
investments in the health and well-being of our residents. Making Medicaid reimbursement 
increases permanent, supporting the nursing and hospital sustainability programs, and 
prioritizing workforce initiatives are all essential to strengthening Hawaii’s healthcare system. 
We respectfully urge you to support these measures and pass the budget bill with these critical 
components intact. Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony, and I am happy to 
answer any questions you may have.

Re: Testimony in SUPPORT of HB300 HD1 
Dear Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki, and the Members of Committee, 
Members of AAUW of Hawaiʻi thank you for this opportunity to testify in support of $3 
million family planning monies in the state budget.  This fund would ensure low-income 
and underinsured patients can continue accessing essential health care services including 
reproductive health care.   
AAUW trusts that everyone can make their own informed choices about their reproductive 
lives and that these deeply personal decisions should be made without government 
interference.  Access to family planning and a full range of reproductive health services 
leads to improvements in women’s health and economic security.   
While we are fortunate to have strong state laws protecting reproductive rights, many 
Medicaid patients have been systematically excluded from access to reproductive health 
care and with the threats to federal funding cuts to Medicaid, the low-income and 
underinsured women are facing a dire reality. 
Therefore, the members of AAUW of Hawaiʻi strongly support funding $3 million for family 
planning in the state budget.  Thank you for your consideration.   
 
Sincerely,  
Younghee Overly

I’m opposed to Executive Budget funding through HB300 for Wolbachia-bacteria-infected 
mosquito releases on Maui and Kaua‘i. 
To suggest that the idea of infecting mosquitos for release anywhere, much less on these 
incredible islands, is insane is a giant understatement. 
Please give your heads a shake.  Your role is to STOP dangerous behaviour, NOT fund it. 
No amount of bribery can justify putting our families and friends at risk.  Please act 
accordingly.

Hearing Date and Time: March 18, 2025, 10:00am (Room 211) 
Re: 
 
 
Testimony of Holomua Collaborative – Support  
 
Aloha Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki, and Members of the Committee: 
 
Mahalo for the opportunity to submit testimony in support of HB300 HD1, Relating to 
the State Budget. In particular, Holomua Collaborative writes in support of three items 
in the budget: 
 
1. $1,750,000 for FY 26 for the Department of Human Resources Development 
(DHRD) to conduct a civil service position classification and compensation 
study; 
2. Adds $338,150 for FY 26 and $1,343,400 for FY 27 for consultant services to 
maintain Tax System Modernization (TSM) projects; and  
3. Adds 6.00 permanent positions and $282,296 for FY 26 and 6.00 permanent 
positions and $564,592 for FY 27 for the Department of Taxation (DOTAX) to 
establish a Tax System Modernization Office and integrate the Internal 
Revenue Services' Direct File Project with TSM. 
 
In October 2024, a survey1 gathering information about the day-to-day financial 
experience of local workers was released, and it suggests that the high cost of living 
and resulting outmigration is a growing crisis that has the potential to reach 
staggering levels. When nearly 1,500 local workers were asked if they may need to 
move to a less expensive state, only thirty-one percent answered a definitive “no,” 
while sixty-nine percent said “yes” or “unsure.” Each local worker and family we lose 
to the continent contributes to a loss of our economy, our culture, and our family. 
 
Many factors contribute to the high cost of living in the state, and Holomua 
Collaborative is devoted to finding ways to keep all local working families in Hawai‘i 
by making sure they can afford to stay. Each of the budget requests identified above 
represent a way to help families stay in Hawai‘i.  
 
Civil Service Position Classification and Compensation Study 
 
State government jobs are categorized and filled via 1,400+ civil service position 
classifications, which form the basis for 17,000+ position descriptions. This system and 
the 1,400 + position descriptions are outdated in terms of structure, requirements, and 
compensation, and need to be modernized to reflect current workforce needs and 
attract a broader pool of applicants. The DHRD budget request detailed above will 
accomplish this.

As of November 2024, the State government had a job vacancy rate of 24%.2 with 
nearly 31% of employees eligible to retire within five years.3 The large vacancy rate 
contributes to less efficient government operations and services, including delayed 
delivery of services relied upon by neighbors in need, such as SNAP, MedQuest, and 
Unemployment Insurance. Furthermore, as long as the position classifications and 
compensation remain outdated, our local workforce will be less inclined to seek out 
and apply for State jobs over better opportunities on the continent. With so many 
vacancies available and the volume of outmigration we face, making State 
employment a competitive and attractive choice is an efficient investment that will 
pay dividends in our future. 
 
Maintain Tax System Modernization (TSM) projects, establishing a TSM Office, 
and Integrating the Internal Revenue Services' Direct File Project with TSM 
 
On average, taxpayers spend approximately 13 hours and $270 preparing their taxes 
each year.4 A significant number of these taxpayers are low-income workers using fee-
based tax preparers such as TurboTax and H&R Block. This reduces the amount of 
money they may get back in tax credits on preparation services. A free program from 
the Internal Revenue Service, Direct File, is currently available for families to prepare 
and file federal and/or state taxes in twenty-five states. The Department of Taxation 
(DOTAX) already uses the same vendor as the participating states.  
 
Including funding in the State budget for expanding access to Direct File for the use of 
residents to file their taxes could save Hawai‘i taxpayers $34.6M in filing fees annually 
and deliver $83.1M in total value to Hawai‘i taxpayers, between filing fees, the time 
cost of filing, and additional federal credits claimed.5 Including the funding for the 
maintenance of the Tax System Modernization (TSM) projects is necessary to have an 
e-filing option to integrate with Direct File. 
 
We urge you to support these budget requests to make life in Hawai‘i a little easier for 
all our neighbors.

SUPPORT HB300 HD1 RELATING TO THE STATE BUDGET 
  
Honorable Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki, and Members of the Committee: 
 
Mahalo for the opportunity to submit testimony in support of the budget appropriation 
for maintaining increased QUEST provider rates for applied behavior analysis 
(ABA) submitted in the Executive Budget for DHS.  
BAYADA is a not-for-profit health care company committed to serving our community. 
We provide services across the state, with behavioral health services for QUEST 
members on Oahu and Maui.  
As a behavioral health service provider, we have struggled to meet the needs of 
children with autism on Med-QUEST due to the increased costs of operating a business 
without increased rates for our services. QUEST rates for the coverage of intensive 
behavioral therapy (IBT) for treatment of children under 21 years of age with autism 
spectrum disorder (ASD), also referred to as ABA, were set in 2015 and had not 
increased, despite the increased costs of living and increased costs for employers over 
the last 8 years. Wages have gone up nearly 30% since 2015 in Hawaiʻi, forcing 
businesses to shoulder the cost without proportionate rate increases, making it harder 
to attract candidates and businesses to the field of supporting individuals with autism 
and their families.  
We appreciate the efforts taken by this committee in 2024 to include funding for 
increased rates for ABA QUEST funded services. These funds were nonrecurring, only 
providing an increase for 2025, therefore it is imperative we pass additional legislation in 
this 2025 session to maintain these rates. It is imperative that the rates be 
maintained now, before any potential cuts to Medicaid.  
ABA services are healthcare services for children mandated by Early and Periodic 
Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment (EPSDT) under Medicaid and are specific to 
children under 21, which will likely help in maintaining this program regardless of 

 
 
 
potential federal cuts. At this point, healthcare related payments, and specifically those 
for children, are not in the category of funds being targeted by the federal 
administration. 
Without the increased rates, we are not able to adequately serve the children with 
autism and their families who need us. As an organization, our values are compassion, 
excellence, and reliability; however, due to difficulties in attracting and retaining staff we 
find ourselves troubled that we cannot consistently deliver these values to our clients.  
Currently, we must maintain a waitlist for clients to access services because there is 
more demand than we are able to meet with our current providers. At our Oahu location, 
40% of those on our waitlist are QUEST members. At our Maui location, 66% are 
QUEST members. We closed our Big Island and Kauai insurance-based services, 
despite ongoing community need, due to losses based on unsustainable rates in 2018. 
These waitlists are only representative of our organization and are similar across 
providers.  
The increased rates approved in last year’s legislative session were published by Med-
QUEST for use beginning 01/01/2025 but then required each provider work with the 
managed care organization (MCO) administering the QUEST benefit to members to 
work out these new rates within their provider contracts. At this point, we have just 
started services under the increased rates for two of the health plans (three remaining) 
and therefore cannot yet report on data from the anticipated positive impact to staff 
hiring and retention and increased access to services for families on our waitlists.  
We respectfully request the Committee maintain funds for QUEST ABA rates in DHS’s 
budget as part of this bill.

HB 300, HD1 
Relating to the State Budget

Jimmy D. Alberts 
Senior Vice President & Chief Operations Officer 
Hawaiian Electric 
 
 
Dear Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki, and Members of the Committee, 
My name is Jimmy D. Alberts and I am submitting written testimony on behalf of 
Hawaiian Electric in strong support of HB 300, HD1, Relating to the State Budget. 
Hawaiian Electric strongly supports continued funding for program number 
LNR404, for the Hawai‘i Mesonet, a statewide network of advanced weather stations 
that provides high-resolution climate data that can improve wildfire prevention and 
response. In the wake of recent devastating wildfires across the islands, it is clear that 
Hawai‘i urgently needs better fire weather monitoring to protect lives, communities, and 
critical infrastructure. As recent events in Hawai‘i and California have demonstrated, 
dry, windy conditions, exacerbated by prolonged drought and strong downslope winds 
can have deadly consequences. A lack of timely, localized weather data makes it 
difficult for emergency responders to anticipate the potential ignition and spread of 
wildfires. In these and other events, timely, site-specific wind speed, humidity, and 
temperature data could have helped first responders, utilities, and emergency managers 
make better-informed, life-saving decisions. Hawai‘i’s fire risk is increasing as drought 
conditions intensify across the islands. While Hawaiian Electric is expanding its own 

Page 2 
 
 
 
 
weather monitoring network, we welcome and encourage the development of the 
Hawai‘i Mesonet.  
As part of potential funding through HB 300, HD1, Hawaiian Electric encourages 
Hawai’i Mesonet to enhance the data transmission frequency of its weather stations 
from 15 minutes to 10 minutes, which would allow the data to become more timely. 
Together, the data provided are critically important for: (1) Monitoring Fire Weather 
Conditions – Mesonet stations provide continuous, publicly accessible updates on wind 
speeds, humidity, and fuel moisture levels; (2) Guiding Wildfire Mitigation Strategies – 
utilities need accurate wind and weather forecasts to assess whether power lines 
should be de-energized in high-risk areas during extreme fire weather conditions; and 
(3) Improving Emergency Response – data allows firefighters to anticipate potential fire 
weather conditions and allocate resources effectively.  
Hawaiian Electric is committed to minimizing wildfire risk and recognizes that 
better weather monitoring is essential to this effort. Investing in the Hawai‘i Mesonet will 
provide utilities, first responders, and communities with additional tools necessary to 
mitigate future fire disasters and build a more resilient Hawai‘i.  
Accordingly, Hawaiian Electric supports HB 300, HD1 and urge the Legislature to 
fund this critical program.  Thank you for this opportunity to submit written testify.

HEARING BEFORE THE  
SENATE COMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS 
  
TESTIMONY ON HB 300, HD1 
RELATING TO THE STATE BUDGET 
 
Conference Room 211 & Videoconference  
10:00 AM  
  
Aloha Chair Dela Cruz, Vice-Chair Moriwaki, and Members of the Committee: 
  
I am Brian Miyamoto, Executive Director of the Hawaiʿi Farm Bureau (HFB).  Organized 
since 1948, the HFB is comprised of 1,800 farm family members statewide and serves as 
Hawaiʿi’s voice of agriculture to protect, advocate, and advance the social, economic, and 
educational interests of our diverse agricultural community.   
 
The Hawaiʿi Farm Bureau respectfully submits testimony in support of HB 300, 
HD1, with a request for funding allocations that will support Hawaii’s agricultural industry. 
 
Hawaii’s agricultural industry faces increasing challenges, including high operational 
costs, labor shortages, and climate-related disruptions. Strategic investments in 
infrastructure, research, and economic support programs are essential to ensure local 
food production's viability, reduce import dependency, and enhance the state’s overall 
food security. 
 
HFB respectfully requests the inclusion of the following HFB funding priorities in the state 
budget: 
 
AGR 122: $19.8 million for the Biosecurity Program: Invasive species have become one 
of the most devastating problems impacting Hawaiʿi. Many invasive species are 
damaging Hawaiʿi’s environment and economy. Hawaiʿi’s farmers and ranchers face 
ongoing challenges from invasive pests such as the coconut rhinoceros beetle, little fire 
ant, coffee berry borer, two-lined spittlebug, macadamia felted coccid, and varroa mite. 
These pests cause significant damage to crops, increase production costs, and threaten 
the viability of local agriculture. Once established, invasive species are costly and difficult 
to control, making prevention and early intervention essential. 
 
Proper funding for DOA is critical for protecting Hawaiʿi’s environment and economy and 
the health and lifestyle of its people through the support of invasive species prevention, 

 
 
control, research, outreach, and planning. Funding permanent biosecurity positions 
ensures that DOA has the necessary personnel to conduct critical inspections, enforce 
quarantine regulations, and implement pest management programs. A well-staffed 
biosecurity team improves the state’s ability to detect and mitigate threats before they 
cause irreversible harm to Hawaiʿi’s farms and ecosystems. 
 
BED 170: $2.5 million for the Waiahole Water System: The Waiahole Water System 
serves over 5,600 acres of agricultural land on Oahu, providing critical irrigation for 
diversified farming operations. This funding request seeks to pay off the bond debt service 
on the system and repair the aging adit 8 tunnel, which is essential to maintaining water 
delivery. Continued operation and maintenance of this system are necessary for long-
term agricultural viability in Central and Leeward Oahu. 
 
UH 100: $5 million for Waimānalo Research Station: As part of a statewide network of 
agricultural experimental stations, the Waimānalo facility plays a key role in agricultural 
research and farmer education. It supports research on specialty crops, tropical fruits, 
sustainable farming techniques, and organic production. Unfortunately, many of the 
station’s facilities are deteriorating and need repair. Without modernization, the station’s 
ability to support Hawaiʿi’s agricultural community will be severely limited. Upgrading 
critical infrastructure will enhance research opportunities, attract external funding, and 
improve outreach to local farmers and ranchers. 
 
UH 100: $6 million for Magoon Research Station: A demand exists to address the need 
for a comprehensive approach to controlled-environment agriculture (CEA) and building 
a state-of-the-art CEA research and demonstration facility. Controlled-environment 
agriculture (CEA) technologies—such as hydroponics, aquaponics, aeroponics, and 
vertical farming—offer efficient, sustainable, and climate-resilient solutions for food 
production in Hawaii. A dedicated research and demonstration facility will provide a hub 
for agricultural innovation, allowing scientists and farmers to test and refine new growing 
techniques, water conservation strategies, and energy-efficient production systems. 
Incorporating these funding requests into the state budget aligns with the Legislature’s 
priorities of supporting local agriculture, strengthening food security, and fostering 
economic sustainability. Each of these investments will contribute to a more resilient and 
self-sufficient agricultural sector, ultimately benefiting Hawaii’s economy, environment, 
and communities. 
 
AGR 192: $5 million for the Farm to Families Program: Hawaiʿi faces persistent food 
security challenges, with many families experiencing limited access to fresh, locally grown 
food. At the same time, local farmers and ranchers struggle with unpredictable markets 
and barriers to expanding food distribution. The Farm to Families program presents a win-
win solution by linking local food production with communities in need, ensuring that 
Hawaiʿi’s agricultural products are used to feed Hawaiʿi’s people. 
 
We appreciate the committee’s consideration of these critical funding requests. 
 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify on this matter.

RE: HB 300 HD1 – Relating to the State Budget – SUPPORT 
 
Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki, and members of the Committee: 
 
Thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony in support of HB 300 HD1, which 
appropriates funds for the operating and capital improvement budget of the Executive Branch for 
fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027. 
 
Hunt Development Group is in support of CIP Item No. 17.00 under BED15O Hawaii 
Community Development Authority that seeks $1,000,000 to prepare a programmatic 
environmental impact statement to cover infrastructure projects, development and master 
plan implementation in Kalaeloa Community Development District (KCDD). 
 
In 2022 and 2023, the Legislature appropriated funds for electrical improvements along Saratoga 
Avenue.  Critical infrastructure improvements are needed in Kalaeloa to support new 
development projects, renovations and improvements. 
 
Hunt Development Group, in connection with its 535-acre portion of HCDA’s 3,700-acre 
Kalaeloa Master Plan, partnered with Gentry Homes to bring the first 389 new for-sale homes for 
local families to Kalaeloa, as well as completed construction on the new, 98,000 square foot state-
of-the-art VA ALOHA medical clinic.  
 
These were made possible, in part, by Hunt Companies taking on the long-needed upgrades to the 
infrastructure and operations of the water utility in Kalaeloa, followed by launching more than 
$35 million of roadway and utility infrastructure that provide benefit to the entire region.   
 
There is much more to be done in terms of roadways, regional connections, utilities, and 
additional water and power infrastructure to make Kalaeloa the vibrant new addition for West 
Oahu families that is envisioned by HCDA’s Master Plan. This capital improvement 
appropriation to prepare a programmatic environmental impact statement is a vital initial step to 
that dream becoming reality.   
 
We appreciate your efforts to help spur much needed infrastructure to support community 
development in Kalaeloa. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Aloha Chair Dela Cruz, 
My name is Liam Chinn  and I live in Honolulu.  As a member of the Reimagining Public 
Safety in Hawai'i Coalition, I support a state budget that increases investments in services 
and programs that build safe and healthy communities. 
We are respectfully requesting that you significantly increase investments in the following 
areas, which are proven by research and data to dramatically increase safety by diverting 
residents out of the criminal justice system and addressing the root causes of poverty, 
crime, and violence. 
• 
Permanent supportive housing and transitional housing 
• 
Community based mental health services 
• 
Youth programs 
• 
Vocational/employment training for living wage jobs 
• 
Restorative Justice and Ho'oponopono 
At least 40% of all people in jail in Hawai'i are homeless. There is consensus among justice 
system actors-including judges, prosecutors, and service providers- that people suffering 
from mental illness and substance abuse disorder should be diverted out of jail and into 
treatment and housing. This would dramatically shrink the jail population, but to succeed, 
the state must fund diversion infrastructure.   
 
 
We are also in a time of fiscal crisis, and the state cannot afford to adequately fund 
diversion while also spending enormous amounts on expanding jails and prisons. Given 
this reality, please remove appropriations for the following projects.  

• 
$30 MIL for planning and design of OCCC jail 
• 
$10 for DCR Statewide Master Plan 
• 
Millions more for jail and prison expansion 
As our elected representatives, you have the opportunity to finally move our state past the 
failed approach of funding more policing and incarceration which has not made us safer, 
toward the proven strategy of funding services and programs that address the root causes 
of poverty, crime, and violence.  
 
Mahalo, 
Liam Chinn

To: Hawaiʻi Senate Committee on Ways and Means 
Hearing Date/Time: Tuesday, March 18, 2025 
Place: Hawaiʻi State Capitol, Rm. 211 and videoconference 
Re:  Testimony of Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates, Hawaiʻi in support of HB 300, HD1 - funding 
for sexual and reproductive health care 
  
Dear Chair Dela Cruz and Members of the Committee, 
Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates urges you to support sexual and reproductive health care in the 
budget and continue our state’s legacy of leadership of protecting access to family planning services and 
abortion care. Patients and providers are relying on lawmakers to hold the line. To maintain patients’ 
access to safety net family planning services, we request the 2025-27 operating budget general funds 
includes $3 million in sustainability funding to Planned Parenthood and $4.4 million to backfill Title 
X should the Trump Administration reimplement the domestic gag rule ($7.4 total over the 
biennium). We also encourage the legislature to prepare for potential additional devastating cuts from the 
Trump Administration and Congress, including banning federal Medicaid funds for gender affirming care 
and for Planned Parenthood. 
Safety net family providers are facing the perfect storm of rising health care and labor costs, workforce 
shortages, and increased patient volumes. Providers across the state are struggling to keep up, leading to 
clinic closures, layoffs, and reduction of services. Safety net providers continue to face financial losses that 
have only deepened since the fall of Roe v. Wade, and we anticipate the Trump Administration will make a 
dire situation worse.  
 
PPAA is requesting $3 million over two years to support PPGNHAIK’s Oahu and Maui health 
centers with sustainability funding to help our health centers stay afloat. Planned Parenthood is the 
leading safety net family planning provider in Hawai’i, and our clinics are facing significant financial 
losses every year due to low reimbursement rates, inadequate family planning funding over the past 
decade, COVID and the related loss of savings, and inflation and rising costs across the board in the health 
care sector. Our patient mix also means we often are serving patients who are low income or underinsured 
and receive discounted or free care, which we often offset and subsidize. With current funding levels, we 
lose approximately $250 for every patient who walks in our doors. This funding would allow us to 
maintain patients’ access to care, competitive wages for our staff, health center maintenance, invest in our 
expanded telehealth program, and maintain other logistical support. 
In the coming months, we also anticipate the lawmakers in Washington, D.C. will take dramatic action to 
gut access to sexual and reproductive health. These attacks include reimplementing the domestic gag rule 
and forcing Hawaiʻi providers out of the Title X family planning program; barring Planned Parenthood 
from serving Medicaid patients; banning federal Medicaid coverage of gender affirming care; and 
attempting to ban or severely restrict abortion nationwide. These are existential threats to safety net 
family planning providers and patients, even here in Hawaiʻi. Other providers would be unable to 
absorb the thousands of patients who rely on safety net providers for care, leading to increased unintended 

2 
 
pregnancies, higher rates of sexually transmitted infections, poorer health outcomes, and denied life-saving 
preventive care. 
Anticipating the reimplementation of the Title X gag rule, safety net family planning providers are also 
requesting $4.4 over two years to backfill lost federal Title X funding. Title X funds provide a broad 
range of discounted family planning services and some STI services to thousands of patients in our state 
under 250% of the Federal Poverty Level, with a sliding fee scale that slides down to zero. Title X is 
primarily for folks who fall into insurance gaps or are underinsured – this includes those who are ineligible 
for Medicaid but who cannot afford insurance or those who cannot use insurance for privacy reasons, like 
young people, military members, or survivors of intimate partner violence.  Family planning clinics that 
rely on Title X funds are often the main source of health care for people of color, LGBTQ+ individuals, 
and people living in rural or geographically isolated areas. 
Sexual and reproductive health care is one of the most powerful and cost-effective investments Hawaiʻi 
can make. For every $1 invested in family planning, our state saves at least $7 on unintended pregnancy 
costs and long-term social service costs that can be routed to other critical services. Safety net family 
planning providers cannot continue to serve patients at present levels without this continued investment. 
And any lack of investment in the family planning safety net care only exacerbates the disparities 
experienced by Medicaid patients, who are disproportionately Black, Indigenous and Native, and Latinx 
due to centuries of racist health care policies.  
 
Our state should invest in services that ultimately lower costs and protect our most historically 
marginalized communities. Our ability to ensure Hawaiʻi’s financial stability depends on making 
smart investments that support our communities and keep people healthy. Reproductive freedom is a 
clear value of Hawaiʻi, and our state must continue to lead by maintaining funding to keep safety net 
providers serving patients.

Testimony of The Nature Conservancy 
Supporting HB300 HD1, Relating to the State Budget. 
Committee on Ways and Means 
March 18, 2025 at 10:00am 
Conference Room 211 and via Videoconference 
 
Dear Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki, and Members of the Committee: 
 
The Nature Conservancy (TNC) Hawai‘i and Palmyra supports funding to enhance, protect, 
conserve, restore and manage Hawaii’s natural resources in HB300, especially the line items 
expressed below.  
 
1. TNC supports the DLNR and the Governor’s request for LNR401 Ecosystem Protection, 
Restoration, and Fisheries Management.  
 
These investments in programs to support our marine and coastal resources will ensure 
that the reefs that line our coasts, which are environmental, economic, recreational, and 
cultural treasures, will continue to support our island lifestyle and livelihoods. Each year, 
our reefs provide flood protection to people, property, and jobs valued at more than $836 
million, support nearshore fisheries worth $13.4 million, and contribute more than $1.2 
billion through reef-related tourism to the state’s economy. We must continue to make the 
vital investments to protect and sustainably manage our aquatic resources.  
 
2. TNC supports the DLNR and the Governor’s request for LNR404 Water Resources, which 
funds the Commission on Water Resource Management Hawai‘i Mesonet (SEQ# 104-001). 
The Hawai‘i Mesonet informs disaster preparedness and response, climate research and 
forecasts and long-term environmental monitoring through a network of sensing 
equipment strategically located throughout Hawai‘i. One such sensor is located at TNC’s 
Waikamoi Preserve and is linked directly to the National Weather Service. Accurate 
weather data, including wind, precipitation and humidity, directly informs management of 
Waikamoi Preserve. For example, our team uses this data to predict where the integrity of 
predator fencing may be compromised, which is critical to the overall health of the 
landscape. Long-term data is needed to track changes in climate that affect our forests and 
oceans, and the Mesonet network fills gaps that allow for climate and water modelers to 
make better predictions about our water resources.

3. TNC supports the DLNR and the Governor’s Message request for LNR407 Natural Area 
Reserves & Watershed Management.  
These funds provide critical funding that provides long-term conservation of watershed 
forests statewide. These investments help reduce erosion, prevent extinction of 
endangered species, increase carbon storage in native forests, and protect Hawai‘i’s fresh 
water. Forested watersheds provide Hawai‘i with drinking water, cultural resources, and 
are home to unique plants and wildlife found nowhere else in the world. Protection is 
needed to safeguard these invaluable resources in the face of threats such as invasive 
species and climate change. Continuing investment in these vital resources will have 
immense long-term impacts for our forests and far beyond. 
4. TNC supports the DLNR and the Governor’s Capital Improvement Plan request for 
$1,750,000 in FY 26 for Pohakea Fire Prevention and Suppression Infrastructure. 
Three watersheds including Pohakea, Waikapu, and Waiakoa all flow into Maʻalaea Bay, 
which once supported unique limu and coral reef habitat on the leeward Maui coastline. 
Stormwater infrastructure modifications, increased ungulate presence and fire have led to 
big mud slides entering the bay during storms. Hui o ka Wai Ola data show that the bay is 
impaired from turbidity, and working to protect the mauka watershed is key to restoring 
ecosystem health. Fire and erosion control at Ma‘alaea is needed to contain wildfires at 
this ignition hotspot and prevent them from spreading. The State’s proposal would 
leverage federal funds to replace high fuel load invasive vegetation with native plants 
adapted for riparian green belts. The strategic restoration of these fire-prone lands 
provides important cost-effective protections for life and property in nearby Ma‘alaea 
Village. The proposed improvements would hold back sediments from reaching the unique 
and valuable Ma’alaea coral reefs and harbor, thereby saving on future restoration costs.  
 
5. TNC supports DNLR and the Governor’s Operating Budget request for $3,000,000 in FY26 
for West Maui fire prevention: Ukumehame Wetland and Stream, Maui.  
Besides providing habitat for endangered water birds and other native plant and animal 
species, the Ukumehame Wetland serves as hazard mitigation for environmental threats 
such as lowland wildfire, coastal flooding and upland erosion, protecting coastlines and the 
precious 939-acre Olowalu coral reef system. These wetlands are degraded from sugar-era 
land use and draining, and once provided key habitat for wetland birds, plants, insects and 
fish, as documented through ‘olelo, photos, wetland surveys and historical maps. 
Restoration of Ukumehame Wetlands is positioned for success as the lands designated for 
the project are generally undeveloped and already under state jurisdiction, and the 
investment will unlock additional federal support critical to its completion. This is an 
excellent opportunity to expand the effective foot print of the wetland from 25 to 88 acres, 
replace high fuel load invasive plants with low stature native wetland vegetation, and

restore riparian buffers and fuel breaks at two gulches that feed to Ukumehame Wetland, 
Makiwa and Hana‘ula. 
These budget items contribute to the resilience, sustainability and continued health of our islands’ 
environment, economy, and quality of life. We thank you for appreciating the critical importance 
of protecting the lands and waters on which all life depends. 
 
Mahalo for the opportunity to testify in support of HB300 HD1. 
 
Guided by science, TNC is a non-profit organization dedicated to the preservation of the lands and waters upon which 
all life depends. The Conservancy has helped protect more than 200,000 acres of natural lands in Hawai‘i and Palmyra 
Atoll. We manage 40,000 acres in 13 nature preserves and have supported over 50 coastal communities to help protect 
and restore the nearshore reefs and fisheries of the main Hawaiian Islands.

COMMENTS FOR HB 300 RELATING TO THE STATE BUDGET 
Hawai‘i Friends of Restorative Justice (HFRJ) strongly supports budget appropriations for 
the Department of Education and the Office of Hawaiian Affairs while firmly opposing 
the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation’s (DCR) request for $30 million to plan a 
larger O‘ahu jail. The state has already wasted approximately $40 million on failed jail and 
prison planning, demonstrating a lack of foresight and the inability to design effective 
correctional facilities. 
The expansion of the women’s prison exemplifies this failure. In 2018, the state spent 
$350,000 to contract the University of Hawai‘i School of Architecture’s Community Design 
Center to improve the prison’s design with “self-sustaining programs and facilities that reduce 
recidivism in Hawaii” (TASK ORDER 1 PSD & UH contract v.6/27/18, Page 1). Despite the 
large expenditure for these critical needs, the prison’s construction ignored them. No additional 
classrooms, no large gymnasium, and dedicated rehabilitation spaces were included—there are 
basic elements that modern correctional facilities provide to support education, wellness, and 
reintegration. Education and physical activity have been proven to reduce recidivism, yet 
Hawai‘i’s incarcerated women remain without these essential resources. 
Instead of wasting more money on jail planning, the state should prioritize education—both for 
those currently incarcerated, who typically read at a 4th to 6th grade level, and for youth to 
prevent future incarceration. Research shows that especially early childhood, vocational training, 
and higher education—significantly reduce crime rates by providing individuals with the skills 
and opportunities needed to succeed, while incarceration perpetuates disadvantage, 
disproportionately impacting Native Hawaiians and other marginalized groups. 
Spending $30 million on additional jail planning is a waste of taxpayer dollars. Our limited 
resources should be invested in real solutions that empower communities—not expand 
incarceration. We urge you to reject this funding request and instead champion education as the 
path to a safer, stronger Hawai‘i.

_________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
Hawai‘i Public Health Institute (HIPHI)1 and the Healthy Eating, Active Living2 
(HEAL) coalition is in support with amendments of HB 300, which appropriates 
funds for the operating and capital improvement budget of the Executive Branch 
for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027. 
 
Please increase funding for the number of SNAP processing positions within the 
Department of Human Services. 
 
One in three households in Hawai‘i face food insecurity.3 Federal Supplemental 
Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits are a lifeline to many of these 
residents. Local families in need receive over $600 million annually in SNAP 
benefits.4 Unfortunately, the state has made accessing these benefits incredibly 
difficult. The state needs to improve the enrollment process and ensure local 
SNAP-eligible residents can receive the federal benefits they need. 
 
One Additional Worker Could Provide $2 Million in Federal Benefits 
Our SNAP office enrolls over 60,000 households annually, with less than 300 staff. 
That is more than 200 applications per staff member. Given the extreme backlog, 
adding one extra person to our SNAP department could be the difference 
between 200 families receiving SNAP benefits or not. At an average benefit per 
household of over $9,600 annually, this worker could help provide these 200 
families in need with $2 million in total federal food assistance.

Difficulty Enrolling 
Local Hawai‘i residents face immense barriers when trying to enroll in SNAP. Wait times often exceed four 
hours, causing many applicants to abandon the process out of frustration.5 Physical office locations are 
frequently inaccessible, further compounding the issue. When residents call the Department of Human 
Services (DHS) at their scheduled time for the required interview, their calls often go unanswered, leaving 
them unable to complete the process. Days or weeks later, they receive a callback from an unrecognized 
number at an unscheduled time, making it difficult for many applicants to answer—especially if they are at 
work or attending to other responsibilities. As a result, their missed interview leads to a denial of their 
application, creating an unfair cycle that denies residents the support they need. 
 
Currently, only 62% of eligible residents participate in the program, with participation among kūpuna 
even lower at just 35%.6 Systemic challenges, including incorrect application denials and missed interview 
opportunities, leave many families without the critical support they need. 
 
SNAP Office is Understaffed Following Increased Demand 
In fiscal year 2023-2024, the SNAP department processed 90,000 applications—a 50% increase from 
60,000 in 2017-2018.78 Despite this dramatic rise in demand, staffing levels have remained stagnant at 
around 275 employees for several years. This lack of sufficient staffing has made the enrollment process 
so difficult. To adequately support residents, the state must increase staffing to match the escalating 
demand. 
 
With demand already on the rise, fifty thousand additional households have become eligible for SNAP this 
month as the net income threshold was removed from the eligibility test.9 The need for more staff is 
urgent now—and will become even more critical as more families apply.​
​
We must increase both the number of budgeted positions and the pay for these roles to ensure they are 
filled. Raising salaries will help attract and retain qualified staff, while expanding available positions across 
the board will allow for targeted recruitment in areas with low vacancy rates, ensuring equitable access to 
services statewide. 
 
During the height of the pandemic our state sprung into action to improve the unemployment office 
staffing situation. With over 100,000 eligible individuals currently missing out on SNAP benefits, we must 
take bold, urgent action to streamline the application process and ensure that every qualified person can 
access the support they need.

10:1 Return on Investment 
Our low SNAP participation rate means far fewer Hawai‘i residents are accessing critical federal benefits 
than they should. Since half of SNAP processing staff salaries are covered by federal funds, increasing 
staffing levels would require the state to contribute only half the investment.10 
 
Adding an additional $10 million for staff on top of the roughly $20 million we spend now would bring in 
an additional $10 million in funding from the federal government for those staff. If that can help raise the 
SNAP participation rate from 62% to just 75%, we could bring in over $100 million in additional federal 
funding annually. A $10 million investment now would give more than a 10:1 return on investment, with 
more than $100 million coming back to the state. 
 
By failing to hire enough staff to ensure a smooth and efficient application process, we are effectively 
leaving federal dollars on the table and missing an opportunity to better support our community. 
 
Variable Vacancy Rates 
Many staff locations face high vacancy rates, making it challenging to fill positions. However, some sites 
have lower-than-average vacancies, presenting an opportunity to quickly expand the workforce. By 
adding positions to these locations, we could bring in dozens of new employees to strengthen the 
department. 
 
Please increase funding for SNAP staff positions and pay to ensure that federal SNAP benefits remain a 
reliable and accessible lifeline for all eligible residents in need.

Aloha Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki, and Committee Members:  
My name is Kristen Young, I grew up on O‘ahu and currently live in Makiki. In my individual 
capacity I participate as a member of the Reimagining Public Safety in Hawai‘i coalition and 
Faith Action for Community Equity which has advocated for housing and bail reform among 
other issues. I’m testifying in strong opposition to provisions in HB300 that expand mass 
incarceration and the building of a new $1 billion super jail. 
When I look around today at our islands, I am saddened by what I see. We have clearly not 
invested in the wellbeing of the people of this place. There are also things that much of the 
public does not get to see, such as our own neighbors locked up in jail/prison. According to 
Prison Policy Initiative, Hawai‘i’s incarceration rate stands out internationally, locking up a 
higher percentage of its people than almost any democratic country on Earth. Among those 
locked up, Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders, and Black residents are overrepresented. This 
should disturb all of us.  
People are not naturally criminals. We need to consider the conditions that can lead to someone 
being locked up in our legal system and address those. People don’t need to be locked up—
they need supportive housing, healthcare, treatment, food, community services and support. We 
CAN’T fund these things if we’re spending nearly $1 billion on a new jail and even more to then 
keep people in there. 
Budgets reveal what and who we care about. The proposed budget includes an appropriation for 
the building of a new OCCC, but we don’t need a new $1 billion jail. Instead, we need to fund 
youth and education programs, affordable housing, job training, family strengthening and 
violence interruption programs, community-based health, treatment and reintegration programs 
rooted in evidence-based practices, and restorative justice to help us build communities that are 
safe, healthy, and equitable. 
Recently, a bill that would provide universal free school meals for public school students was 
killed, not even given a hearing. I assume it was due to budget concerns. The fact that we would 
not even entertain the possibility of feeding keiki while we proceed to lock up their caregivers is 
appalling and deeply concerning. 

Investing in a new jail would be DIVESTING in infrastructure and services that could truly 
support our community and I believe this would increase harm in our communities. For this 
reason I oppose HB300. 
Please prioritize people, including the most vulnerable, in the budget. 
Mahalo for your time and consideration.

Re:  
House Bill 300 HD1, Relating to the State Budget 
 
Early Childhood Action Strategy (ECAS) is a statewide cross-sector collaborative designed to improve 
the system of care for Hawai‘i’s youngest children and their families. ECAS partners work to align 
priorities for children prenatal to age eight, streamline services, maximize resources, and improve 
programs to support our youngest keiki.  
We are writing to outline our support for specific funding requests in House Bill 300 that would expand 
early learning opportunities for local keiki. ECAS feels strongly that supporting local keiki by providing 
them with access to high-quality learning environments is a worthwhile investment in our community’s 
future. 
We would like to specifically note our support for the following items: 
• Funds & Positions to open 50 additional Executive Office on Early Learning (EOEL) Public 
Prekindergarten classrooms over the next two years (EDN700) 
• Funding for Family Child Interaction Learning (FCIL) Program contracts (EDN700) 
Expansion of these programs is a critical step toward providing more local children and their families 
with high-quality early learning experiences that would better prepare them to succeed in elementary 
school, secondary school, and beyond. 
For these reasons, ECAS strongly supports the inclusion of these items HB300 HD1. 
Mahalo for the opportunity to provide this testimony.

POSITION:  
SUPPORT WITH COMMENTS 
 
Aloha e Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki, and Members of the committee, 
On behalf of Hawai‘i Children’s Action Network Speaks!, we urge the legislature to prioritize 
funding for early learning opportunities, reproductive health care access, and re-establishing the 
state’s oral health program. These investments are essential to ensuring Hawai'i's families' 
health, well-being, and future success. 
Investing in Early Learning for Hawai‘i’s Keiki 
Expanding access to high-quality early learning is one of the most effective ways to promote 
educational equity, support underserved families, and build a strong foundation for lifelong 
success. A comprehensive approach that includes both classroom expansion and programmatic 
funding is necessary to fulfill the state’s commitment to universal early learning. 
To achieve this, we urge your support for the following essential funding priorities: 
• 
Funding and positions to establish 50 additional Executive Office on Early Learning 
(EOEL) Public Prekindergarten classrooms over the next two years (EDN 700): 
o Expands access to high-quality early learning, prioritizing enrollment for 
underserved keiki 
o Strengthens efforts to achieve universal early learning for three- and four-year-
old keiki 
o Enhances kindergarten readiness and long-term academic success 
 
• 
Funding for Family Child Interaction Learning (FCIL) Program contracts (EDN 700): 
o Broadens early learning opportunities to meet the diverse needs of working 
families 
o Emphasizes a multi-generational, culturally responsive approach to early learning 
 	

PO Box 23198 • Honolulu, HI 96823 • 808-531-5502 
speaks.hawaii-can.org • info@hcanspeaks.org 
 
o Empowers families to play an active role in their children’s cognitive, social, and 
emotional development 
o Provides essential parent education alongside early learning experiences 
 
• 
Additional funding for the Hawai‘i School Facilities Authority (SFA) to continue 
Prekindergarten classroom development and construction: 
o Addresses the urgent need for affordable, high-quality early learning 
opportunities for more than 8,000 underserved keiki 
o Builds on the SFA’s recent progress in completing 56 prekindergarten classrooms, 
creating over 1,000 new preschool seats 
o Ensures that the expansion of prekindergarten seats continues without delay by 
closing a $60 million funding gap 
o Prevents at least a two-year delay in seven major preschool projects that would 
impact more than 600 keiki 
Without continued investment in early learning, we risk delaying critical progress toward 
universal preschool access, leaving thousands of Hawai‘i’s keiki without the foundation for 
academic success. 
Protecting Access to Sexual and Reproductive Health Care 
Hawai‘i has long been a leader in protecting access to family planning services and abortion care, 
and we urge the legislature to continue this legacy by ensuring the sustainability of safety net 
family planning providers. Patients and providers are relying on lawmakers to hold the line 
against federal threats to reproductive health care access. 
To maintain patients’ access to essential health care, we request that the 2025-27 operating 
budget general funds include: 
• 
$3 million in sustainability funding to Planned Parenthood to ensure continued access to 
family planning services 
• 
$4.4 million to backfill Title X funding should the Trump Administration reimplement the 
domestic gag rule ($7.4 million total over the biennium) 
Additionally, we encourage the legislature to prepare for potential additional cuts from the 
Trump Administration and Congress, including the banning of federal Medicaid funds for gender-
affirming care and for Planned Parenthood. 
Safety net family providers face a perfect storm of rising health care and labor costs, workforce 
shortages, and increased patient volumes. Healthcare providers across the state are struggling 
to keep up, leading to closures, layoffs, and reduced services. The financial strain on providers 

PO Box 23198 • Honolulu, HI 96823 • 808-531-5502 
speaks.hawaii-can.org • info@hcanspeaks.org 
 
has only worsened since the fall of Roe v. Wade, and we anticipate further challenges ahead. 
Without state support, access to essential sexual and reproductive health care will be at risk for 
thousands of Hawai‘i residents. 
Re-Establishing Hawai‘i’s State Oral Health Program 
Oral health is a critical but often overlooked component of overall well-being. It is imperative 
that we invest resources to re-establish the state’s oral health program to fully assess oral health 
needs, infrastructure, and gaps in care. A dedicated program under the Department of Health is 
necessary to: 
• 
Conduct ongoing assessments of oral health trends and disparities across Hawai‘i’s 
communities 
• 
Work with stakeholders to develop evidence-based strategies that address barriers to 
care 
• 
Ensure that all residents, particularly underserved populations, have access to affordable 
and preventive oral health services 
By restoring the state oral health program, Hawai‘i can take a proactive approach in addressing 
longstanding disparities, reducing costly emergency dental visits, and improving the overall 
health of our communities. 
Investing in early learning, reproductive health care, and oral health are interconnected priorities 
that support the well-being of Hawai‘i’s families. These critical services ensure that keiki have a 
strong start in life, that families receive the support they need, and that individuals maintain 
access to the full spectrum of healthcare services. 
For these reasons, we respectfully urge you to include this funding in the Senate Draft of the 
budget. Mahalo for your time and consideration in supporting Hawai‘i’s keiki, families, and 
communities.

Dear Chair and Members of the Senate Ways and Means Committee, 
 
Aloha Nui! 
 
I am writing to express my strong support for including $5.5 million for the 
Waimānalo CARES Center and $6 million for the Magoon Research and Teaching 
Station in the state budget bill, HB 300, HD1. These allocations are crucial for our 
community and will significantly impact both the residents of Waimānalo and the 
broader educational and research efforts in Hawaii. 
 
Waimānalo CARES Center: 
The Waimānalo CARES Center plays a vital role in providing essential services and 
support to the local community. This funding will enable the center to enhance its 
programs, expand its reach, and improve the quality of life for residents. By investing in 
this center, we are investing in the well-being and prosperity of our community. 
 
Magoon Research and Teaching Station: 
The Magoon Research and Teaching Station is an important educational and research 
facility that contributes significantly to Hawaii's academic and environmental initiatives. 
This funding will support critical research projects, educational programs, and 
community engagement activities, ultimately benefiting both students and the broader 
community. 
 
I urge you to approve these allocations as they represent a wise investment in 
our state's future. These projects align with the values of community support, 
education, and environmental stewardship that are essential to Hawaii's growth and 
prosperity. 
Mahalo Nui for considering my testimony. I look forward to your support for these 
important initiatives. 
 
Mahalo,

Hawai‘i Lodging & Tourism Association 
 
Senate Committee on Ways and Means 
HB 300 HD1 – Relating to the State Budget 
March 18, 2025 
Aloha Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki, and members of the Committee, 
The Hawai‘i Lodging & Tourism Association (HLTA) submits testimony in strong support of increased 
funding for the Hawai‘i Tourism Authority (HTA) within the state budget, aligning with HTA’s request 
for $80 million in Fiscal Year 2026. 
 Tourism is the economic backbone of our state, generating billions of dollars in visitor spending 
annually and contributing billions more in state tax revenue. It is Hawai‘i’s largest return on 
investment, sustaining hundreds of thousands of jobs and supporting local businesses across all 
islands. For an industry that fuels our economy at this scale, it is critical that we continue to invest 
in its growth, stability, and sustainability. 
HTA plays a pivotal role in destination management, marketing, and stewardship to ensure that 
tourism remains responsible, culturally respectful, and economically beneficial for our residents. 
Now that this responsibility has been codified, it is important that the mandates be funded as much 
as possible. The agency’s ability to promote Hawai‘i globally, restore international markets, and 
enhance destination stewardship programs is directly tied to adequate funding. Without sufficient 
resources, Hawai‘i risks losing its competitive edge in the global travel market, resulting in 
economic setbacks that will affect businesses and workers statewide. 
 We respectfully urge the Legislature to fully fund HTA at $80 million in Fiscal Year 2026 to ensure 
that our tourism industry continues to thrive, our local businesses are supported, and our residents 
benefit from the economic opportunities that tourism provides. 
 Mahalo for your consideration.

HB 300 HD1- RELATING TO THE STATE BUDGET  
LNR404 - WATER RESOURCES 
 
 
Honorable Chair Dela Cruz; Vice-Chair Moriwaki, and committee members, 
The County of Hawaii, Department of Water Supply (DWS) strongly supports HB 300, LNR404 to 
provide funding for water resource management.  
 
The Commission on Water Resource Management (CWRM) has the tremendous responsibility of 
administering the State Water Code, which was established to protect and manage the waters of the 
State of Hawaii. 
 
As one of the major stakeholders under CWRM’s purview, we may not agree on everything; but what 
we do agree on is that they should be funded appropriately to meet their mission. 
 
We thank you for your attention to this matter, and for your dedication and commitment to serving our 
State. 
 
 
Please feel free to contact me at (808) 961-8050 or via email at dws@hawaiidws.org with any 
questions you may have regarding DWS’ comments. Thank you for your time and consideration of our 
testimony on HB 300 HD1.

The Hawai‘i Oral Health Coalition, a program of the Hawai‘i Public Health Institute1, is in support of HB 
300 HD1, which appropriates funds for the operating and capital improvement budget of the Executive 
Branch for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027.  
 
The mission of the Hawai‘i Oral Health Coalition (HOHC) is to improve the overall health and well-being 
of all Hawai‘i residents by improving access and equity in oral health care through collaborative 
partnerships, advocacy, and education. HOHC is a community-driven organization comprised of members 
representing organizations and individuals from diverse sectors across Hawai‘i.  
 
Oral health is essential to the overall physical, psychological, social, and economic well-being of Hawai‘i’s 
residents. Yet, our residents suffer from poor oral health:  
• 
Hawai‘i has among the highest prevalence of dental decay in children and adults compared to 
other states.  
• 
Low-income families, intellectually and developmentally disabled residents, kūpuna, Native 
Hawaiian and Pacific Islander populations, and neighbor island residents are disproportionately 
impacted by poor oral health. 
• 
Lack of an in-state dental school, geographic isolation, lack of community water fluoridation, and 
societal inequities are significant contributors to our poor oral health status. 
 
Forty-two states maintain dedicated public dental health staff responsible for assessing and monitoring 
the population’s oral health status, community needs, and infrastructure; informing and educating the 
public about the importance of oral health; and working to reduce barriers to dental care. Funding for the 
state public oral health program was cut in 2009, with limited funding to sustain the Hospital and 
Community Dental Services Branch only, which has been positioned under the Developmental Disabilities 
Division since then. 
 
1 Hawai'i Public Health Institute (HIPHI) is a hub for building healthy communities, providing issue-based advocacy, education, and 
technical assistance through partnerships with government, academia, foundations, business, and community-based organizations. 

hawaiioralhealthcoalition.org • 707 Richards Street, Suite 300, Honolulu, Hawai'i 96813

According to HRS §321-61 - 63, the Hawaii State Department of Health must study and appraise the 
State's dental health needs and resources, and shall foster the development and expansion of dental 
health services to the people of the State. To accomplish this the department requires adequate resources 
to: 
• 
Conduct research, investigations, experiments, demonstrations, and studies relating to the 
incidence, causes, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of dental diseases; 
• 
Supervise, provide, and direct clinical dental health services for adults and children in the State; 
• 
Develop and conduct a program of dental health education of the public; 
• 
Provide information and education relating to dental health to public health nurses, teachers, 
social workers, and others who deal in a professional capacity with the public, through 
publications, seminars, institutes, and other appropriate means; and 
• 
Provide training for professional personnel to staff state and local dental health programs. 
 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently only provide funding to 20 states and one US 
territory2. Hawai‘i is not among these states. Furthermore, the extent to which federal funding will reach 
Hawai‘i for oral health programming in the future is more uncertain than ever. 
 
It has been more than 10 years since the most recent statewide oral health assessments of Hawai‘i 
residents. Key findings indicated that Hawai‘i’s keiki experience the highest rates of tooth decay in the 
nation3. The state continues to see high rates of emergency department (ED) utilization for preventable 
oral health conditions, with the greatest rate of ED visits occurring on neighbor islands, and among 
Medicaid patients4. Additionally, just over half of children with Medicaid (54.3%) are receiving preventive 
dental services5. 
 
It is imperative that we invest resources to re-establish the state’s oral health program to better 
understand the full scope of oral health needs, resources, infrastructure, and to identify evidence-based 
best practices, which can best address the barriers and gaps in our existing oral health care systems. 
dedicated staffing under the Department of Health is necessary to identify and develop the strategies 
that address the critical needs of our communities, provide ongoing assessment of oral health trends and 
systems, and work with stakeholders to develop effective approaches to improving oral health outcomes 
for all Hawai‘i residents.  
 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify.

The School Facilities Authority (SFA) strongly supports House Bill 300, House Draft 1, 
which appropriates funds for the operating and capital improvement budget of the Executive 
Branch for fiscal years 2026 and 2027. 
 
SFA focuses on building modern learning spaces for public schools and contemporary living

processes that maximize the long-term value of our projects while accelerating their 
completion time. SFA has three main initiatives: expansion of preschools, a new Central 
Maui school, and workforce housing.  
 
SFA asks the committee to approve two capital improvement program requests in Governor 
Josh Green’s executive budget, $100 million for a new Central Maui school (EDN450 Item 
No. G-14) and $20 million for education workforce housing (EDN450 Item No. G-15). 
 
Thank you for this opportunity to testify.

Please maintain the current 2025 provided Medicaid rates to support children with autism. This 
action does not increase the budget from year to year and reaps the benefits of the rate study that 
was completed in 2024. It helps increase wages for local employees while supporting a 
vulnerable population. This is a win win with no increased financial impact from 2025 to 2026 
and beyond.

I am the President of Behavior Analysis No Ka Oi, Inc., a Kaka’ako-based clinic 
that has been providing services to individuals with autism for over 15 years. Our 
clinic specializes in applied behavior analysis (ABA), an empirically validated, 
medically necessary treatment for children diagnosed with autism and related 
disorders. While the passing of Luke’s Law in 2015 was a significant milestone, 
requiring health insurance coverage for autism diagnosis and treatment, the 
Medicaid fee schedule for ABA services has remained unchanged. 
 
Over the past decade, operational costs have risen significantly. Expenses related 
to rent, employee health insurance and benefits, and mileage reimbursements for 
employees commuting to homes and community sites have all increased. Despite 
these rising costs, the lack of increases to the Medicaid fee schedule has severely 
impacted our ability to recruit and retain qualified providers. 
 
We cannot offer competitive wages compared to school-based services, which are 
reimbursed at higher rates. This has led to challenges in hiring the best providers 
and retaining experienced staff. Many of our qualified professionals have 
relocated to the mainland, where the cost of living is lower, and fee schedules are 
more favorable, or leave the field completely. As a result, our clinic now has a 
waitlist of approximately three years for services. While the passage of Luke’s 
Law was a monumental advancement in securing services for the people of 
Hawai’i, it is not impactful if those it was meant to serve cannot find providers.  

2 
 
In conclusion, additional funding for the Med-Quest Division is essential to 
address the gap in non-covered or under-covered behavioral health services. This 
funding will ensure that medically necessary ABA services are accessible to 
individuals with autism in Hawai’i and help clinics like ours recruit and retain 
qualified providers to meet the growing demand for services.

To: 
Senator Donovan M. Dela Cruz, Chair

Members of the Senate Committee on Ways and Means 
 
From:  Llasmin Chaine, LSW, Executive Director, Hawaiʻi State Commission on the Status of Women 
 
Re:  
Testimony in Support of HB300 HD1, Relating to the State Budget 
 
 
Hearing: 
Tuesday, March 18, 2025, 10:00 a.m. 
 
 
 
Conference Room 211, State Capitol 
 
The Hawaiʻi State Commission on the Status of Women (HSCSW), which is administratively attached to the 
Department of Human Services, strongly supports HB300 HD1, which outlines the HSCSW’s operating budget, 
HMS 888, Page 44, Item No. 16.  I respectfully ask that the Committee pass HB300 HD1 with the requested 
appropriations for the continued funding of the Hawaiʻi State Commission on the Status of Women. 
 
The HSCSW was created by executive order on May 15, 1964, and functions as a central clearinghouse of 
resources, services and advocacy for women and girls.  The Commission engages in legislative advocacy and 
implementation, develops programs, collaborates with community organizations and state departments, 
provides field placements for students, delivers trainings and technical assistance, and serves as an 
informational resource for Hawaiʻi’s women and girls, on a broad range of policies and issues. 
 
Considering the current federal administrative priorities and active measures: to dissuade and disrupt gender 
equity policies1; to reduce or eliminate funding for survivor advocacy2 and gender-based violence prevention 
education3; and to promote regressive gender roles4,5; ongoing state budgetary support of the Commission 
on the Status of Women is especially needed and greatly appreciated. 
 
I respectfully urge this Committee to pass HB300 HD1 in support of the continued funding of the Commission 
on the Status of Women.  Thank you for this opportunity to provide testimony.

Hawai‘i Unites is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to the conservation and protection 
of our environment and natural resources. We are opposed to allocating funds through the State 
of Hawai‘i Executive Budget bill HB300 for Wolbachia-bacteria-infected mosquito release 
experiments on Maui and Kaua‘i. The DLNR’s 2025-27 Budget Overview1 briefing includes this 
statement in reference to DOFAW LNR 102, LNR 172, LNR 402, LNR 407, and LNR 804: 
 
“Novel management strategies are needed to prevent the imminent extinction of several 
of Hawaii’s endangered forest birds due to disease spread because of climate change-
induced mosquito range expansion and the subsequent spread of avian malaria.” 
 
Current “novel management strategies” in use by the DLNR and their Birds, Not Mosquitoes 
agency partners include the release of millions of Wolbachia-bacteria-infected mosquitoes on our 
fragile ecosystems on Maui and Kaua‘i. No studies have been done on the potential significant 
impacts of these projects or on the serious risks to the health of our islands’ people, wildlife, and 
‘āina. No environmental impact statement (EIS) has been completed for any island. Hawai‘i 
Unites’ active court case2 to stop the mosquito releases on Maui and require an EIS brings forth 
several significant concerns, including: 
 
• 
Accidental release of female mosquitoes that bite, breed, and spread disease (EPA 
guidelines3 allow for the release of one female for every 250,000 males; just one female 
released can produce 160,000 more females through breeding of the generations in her 
lifespan; 3,103 females are allowed to be released weekly on Maui4 – up to 6,000 
mosquitoes released twice weekly per acre in the 64,666-acre project area: 6,000 x 2 x 
64,666 = 775,992,000 mosquitoes divided by 250,000 equals 3,103 females weekly) 
• 
Peer-reviewed studies showing Wolbachia bacteria can cause increased pathogen 
infection5 and disease-spreading capability5,6 in mosquitoes 
• 
Horizontal transmission7 of Wolbachia bacteria to wild mosquitoes and other insect 
vectors of disease 
• 
Population replacement of wild mosquitoes with lab-altered mosquitoes (as few as three 
females released8 can cause population replacement) 
• 
Wind drift of released mosquitoes to unintended areas 
• 
Lack of documented biosecurity protocols and pathogen screenings for the imported 
mosquitoes 
• 
Risks to the health of people and animals, and the potential for the plan to cause the 
extinction of the native birds it is meant to protect 
 
Tropical disease and vector expert Dr. Lorrin Pang has testified9 as an expert witness in our 
case10 and has affirmed that this mosquito experiment has not been studied enough for the State 
of Hawai‘i and its agency partners to move forward. Dr. Pang has decades of experience as a 
leader in mitigating mosquito-borne diseases. He has authored over 75 publications in peer-
reviewed medical journals, over 40 of which are focused specifically on mosquito-borne 
illnesses.

The mosquitoes currently being released in the millions on Maui and Kaua‘i are experimental. 
Southern house mosquitoes lab-infected with Wolbachia bacteria have never been documented 
as used for stand-alone field release anywhere in the world. The 64,666-acre East Maui project 
area is the largest Wolbachia mosquito release of any kind globally to date, and Kaua‘i’s 59,204-
acre project area is the second largest. 
 
The agencies releasing these lab-altered mosquitoes have admitted11 that the plan does not 
include monitoring the effects of the experimental mosquitoes on forest birds. 
 
Mass release of these mosquitoes began on Maui in November 2023. The DLNR and their 
partnering agencies have produced no data on the results of these mosquito releases. There has 
been no indication that the plan is even working for its intended purpose. Deviations from the 
approved plan have also been occurring for over a year. Mosquitoes are being released solely by 
helicopter rather than by drone, exacerbating concerns about noise disturbances, disruptions to 
wildlife habitat, and the potential for collisions, accidents, and wildland fires. The helicopter 
longline release system described in the environmental assessment is not the system being used, 
and helicopters appear to be flying closer to the tree canopy than the approved distance, 
increasing the potential for adverse impacts.  
 
As of February 2025, mosquitoes are now also being mass released on Kaua‘i. Additionally, 
aerial spraying of Bti larvicide on Maui and Kaua‘i in combination with the aerial release of 
bacteria-infected mosquitoes is now occurring. This combination of products is not part of the 
approved plans, and no studies have been done on the impacts of these activities to our 
environment. The agencies involved have not addressed concerns about potential data 
falsification due to the use of two different mosquito suppression products within each project 
area. 
 
Hawai‘i Unites asks that the legislature amend bill HB300 to remove any State of Hawai‘i 
Executive Budget funding allocations for programs and/or projects that include the release of 
Wolbachia-bacteria-infected mosquitoes. Conservation efforts and funding must focus on more 
environmentally sound approaches like habitat and stream flow restoration, which would honor 
the ‘āina, the culture, and the ancestral connections of the native birds rather than putting them at 
further risk of extinction.

“Aloha Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki, and Committee Members:  
   
My name is Boyd Ready, of Haleiwa, 
I support building a new jail! 
It’s unconscionable to keep people in an overcrowded jail, and unfair to families to send 
prisoners off the islands.  
Build a jail that’s big enough to house violent and chronic repeat offenders, with sanitation, 
safety and ease of staffing. 
Don’t give in to the ‘anti-incarceration’ argument that turns our communities into soft targets for 
repeat offenders. 
We deserve to be safe from known criminal offenders in our homes, on our streets, on our farms 
and in our parks and natural areas. 
You can’ t do it without a bigger jail.  Keep it in HB300!

Budgets reveal what and who we care about. The proposed budget includes an appropriation for

I don't usually weigh in on a state budget bill but I must on this one.  HB300 includes an 
appropriation for building a new correctional center in Oahu.  What we need is a way to fund 
expected federal budget cuts to Medicaid, SNAP, TANF, free school meals, and public 
education, not $1 billion jail.  Please let our budget reflect what and who we care about.   
Please delete $30 million appropriated for planning and $10 million for the 10-year Department 
of Corrections Statewide Master Plan.   Thank you for your consideration.

I retired from teaching in Hawaii several years ago and consider the amount to be spent on 
SB300 is unjustifyable. A teacher of mine at BYU Laie, suggested that instead of building larger 
prisons, we try to eliminate the NEED for prisons. Why do people commit crime? 
Undereducation, high cost of living, goods, lack of a future, etc. If the HB300 
funds were spent on affordable housing, education, job training skills, etc, over the long haul we 
would have better educated population, capable of self support, and capable of remaining out of 
prison.

To whom it may concern: 
I am writing in strong support of HB 300, the proposed budget for the State of Hawaii, which 
includes funding to re-establish the Department of Health (DOH) Oral Health Program. This 
program is vital to improving oral health outcomes for all residents of Hawaii, and its restoration 
is long overdue. 
In 2009, the DOH’s Dental Division was dismantled and has not been reinstated since. Since that 
time, many communities across the state have faced an ongoing struggle to access affordable and 
adequate dental care. Oral health is an essential part of overall health, yet for many individuals in 
Hawaii, especially those in underserved areas or facing economic challenges, oral health services 
remain out of reach. 
The funding requested for the reinstatement of this program would not only address critical gaps 
in access to dental care but would also provide long-term benefits for the state’s overall health 
and well-being. Strong evidence links oral health to various other health conditions, including 
cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and even maternal and infant health. By addressing oral health 
disparities through the DOH Oral Health Program, Hawaii can improve overall health outcomes, 
reduce healthcare costs in the long term, and create a more equitable healthcare system for all 
residents. 
Restoring the DOH Oral Health Program would allow the state to provide comprehensive public 
health initiatives, including preventive care, education, and increased access to dental services 
for our most vulnerable populations. This funding is not only an investment in oral health but an 
investment in the overall quality of life for all. 
In conclusion, I urge you to approve HB 300 and support the restoration of funding for the DOH 
Oral Health Program. This program is a critical step toward improving oral health outcomes, 
reducing healthcare costs, and ensuring a healthier future for the residents of Hawaii. 
Thank you for your consideration, 
Karina Gurat

Aloha, 
Safety net providers are facing rising health care costs, workforce shortages, increased abortion 
patient volumes; providers across the country are struggling to keep up, leading to clinic 
closures, layoffs, and reduction of services. Please invest in sexual and reproductive health care 
to make sure providers can continue to deliver care. 
Please include $3 million in family planning monies, ensuring low-income and underinsured 
patients can continue accessing essential health care services. This funding is essential to 
maintain patients’ access to safety-net planning services, including education, counseling, and 
access to contraception.  
Sexual and reproductive health care is one of the most powerful and cost-effective investments 
Hawaiʻi can make. For every $1 invested in family planning, Hawaiʻi saves at least $7 on 
unintended pregnancy costs and long-term social costs that can be routed to other critical 
services.  
Any lack of investment in family planning safety net care exacerbates the disparities experiences 
by Medicaid Patients who have been systemically excluded and harmed. 
Mahalo Nui Loa, 
Noah Hull

I support maintaining increased QUEST provider payments for applied behavior analysis. I am a 
provider who works with children who access ABA services and so many children are unable to 
do so because there are not enough providers and waitlists are so long. We often lose our 
employess to higher paying jobs or to different fields all together. Higher rates would mean 
keeping our employess as well as attracting new possible employees which would allow more 
children to access these life changing services.

Dear Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki, and Members of the Committee on Ways and Means,
My name is Jim Kilgore, and I am the Executive Director of Full Life and serve on the Board of the 
Hawai‘i Waiver Providers Association (HWPA). HWPA represents providers supporting individuals with 
Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (I/DD) through the Medicaid 1915(c) Home and Community-
Based Services (HCBS) Waiver, administered by the Department of Health’s Developmental 
Disabilities Division.
We strongly support the following budget item in HB 300, HD1, scheduled for hearing on March 18, 
2025 at 10:00AM :
HTH 501 – Developmental Disabilities,) Page 25, Item NO. 18 
HTH 501 includes the addition of $10,100,000 for FY 26 and $21,400,000 FY 27 to increase urgently 
needed services through the Medicaid 1915(c) Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) Waiver 
for Individuals  with I/DD and their families. 
Why This Funding is Critical

Severe Workforce Shortage: Providers cannot offer competitive wages to Direct Support 
Professionals (DSPs), leading to a crisis in care.

Inadequate Reimbursement Rates: Rates have not kept pace with rising costs, putting 
services at risk.

Rate Study Findings: After the 2026 minimum wage increase, service costs will be 24% 
higher than current reimbursement rates. Federal Medicaid requires sufficient rates to ensure 
access to care.

Access & Equity: Funding supports workforce development, improves access on neighbor 
islands, expands employment opportunities, and increases residential options.

Preventing Service Cuts: Without funding, providers may reduce services or serve fewer 
individuals, leaving families without support.

Avoiding Institutionalization: Families should not have to choose between placing a loved 
one in a facility or leaving the workforce to provide care.

Cost-Saving Measure: HCBS services save the state $77,000 per person annually compared 
to institutional care. Medicaid Waiver funding also brings a $0.48 federal match per state 
dollar invested, saving taxpayers $300 million annually.
This funding is essential to keeping families together, preventing unnecessary institutionalization, and 
ensuring individuals with I/DD receive the support they need to live independently.
Hawai‘i’s I/DD HCBS Waiver program serves 3,000 of our most vulnerable individuals each year, 
supported by 1,900 DSPs who help them fully participate in the community.
Mahalo for your time and consideration, and for the opportunity to testify in support of HB 300 
HTH 501.

‭Dear Committee on Finance,                                     Testimony pertaining to HB 300‬
‭In Support: On behalf of ABC Group Hawaii (Autism Behavior‬
‭Consulting Group, Inc) serving individuals with autism in Hawaii,‬
‭we ask that you approve the funds allocated for rates to maintain as‬
‭part of the Governer’s budget.  Please approve funding in SB300,‬
‭which appropriates funds to make the temporary reimbursement‬
‭rates for ABA service providers PERMANENT.‬
‭Thank you for your consideration,‬
‭Rep. Kyle T. Yamashita, Chair‬
‭Rep. Jenna Takenouchi, Vice Chair‬
‭Ensuring an adequate provider network is established by offering appropriate rates‬
‭that are reflective of the costs of living, and reimbursement rate increases over time is‬
‭critical. The MedQuest Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) reimbursement rates in‬
‭Hawaii have experienced capitation for more than a decade: and those rates having‬
‭been set in 2015 after the passage of ABA Legislation. We should be reminded that‬
‭these rates selected in 2015 were set BASED ON 2002-2004 the publicly available‬
‭TRICARE rates from that time period.‬‭The rates we‬‭operate on today are not‬
‭dissimilar to those we accepted from TRICARE in 2004.  21 years later,‬
‭reimbursement rates remain generally unchanged, and not reflective of cost of living‬
‭increases or wage increases for technician level providers.‬
‭Capitation of rates, and increased costs of living >70% for Oahu alone since 2004 (US‬
‭Bureau of Labor Statistics), make it impossible to sustain the provision of high quality,‬
‭clinic based medically-necessary Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) treatment‬

‭2‬
‭programs for young children impacted by autism. Since 2015, wages have increased in‬
‭Hawaii over 30%, forcing providers like us to make difficult decisions without having‬
‭reimbursement rate increase as a reflection of the economic conditions or cost of‬
‭living increases in Hawaii.‬
‭The provider shortage is real, and we are tasked with training up providers who leave‬
‭soon after hire, for rates that are near double, within the Department of Education‬
‭(DOE) educational systems. Our long waitlist continues to grow, and the staffing‬
‭barriers have restricted our ability to reduce the length of our waitlist to change the‬
‭lives of Hawaii’s children diagnosed with autism. Our waitlist at ABC today consists of‬
‭60% MedQuest children who need intensive ABA treatment and are unable to access‬
‭that care in a timely manner, per Medicaid standards. This has caused us and other‬
‭providers to maintain long wait lists (some several years long!) for children who are in‬
‭dire need of services and appears to be in direct opposition to the requirements of‬
‭EPSDT and Medicaid.‬
‭The existing MedQUEST rates were increased‬‭TEMPORARILY‬‭for 2025 to reflect‬
‭the increased cost of providing services, per the Milliman Study conducted and the‬
‭Legislature adopted at the lowest reimbursement recommendation level.‬
‭As indicated below, other states with similar costs of living have‬‭PERMANENT‬
‭rates (orange) more in line with economic forces and cost of living. Further, recent‬
‭CMS guidance from SHO 24-0005 was consistent with these concerns: “Although‬
‭adequate provider rates are not, in and of themselves, enough to ensure a sufficient‬
‭network, without them, any steps a state might take to improve the provider‬
‭workforce likely will be less effective.”‬

‭3‬
‭According to the most recent estimates from the Centers for Disease Control, 1 in‬
‭every 36 children are diagnosed with Autism.  This indicates that more than 2.78% of‬
‭Hawaii’s children on Medicaid have Autism . MANY of these young children are‬
‭unable to access the most basic, evidence-based, medically-necessary treatments to‬
‭ameliorate symptoms of their diagnosis and in some cases, change the trajectory of‬
‭their lives.‬
‭We greatly appreciate the efforts taken in 2024 to include funding for increased rates‬
‭for MEDQUEST funded ABA treatment. These funds were nonrecurring, only‬
‭providing an increase for 2025, therefore it is imperative we pass additional legislation‬
‭in the 2025 session to maintain these rates beyond 2025.‬
‭On behalf of ABC Group Hawaii (Autism Behavior Consulting Group, Inc) serving‬
‭individuals with autism in Hawaii, we ask that you approve the funds allocated for‬
‭rates to maintain as part of the Governer’s budget.  Please approve funding in SB300,‬
‭which appropriates funds to make the temporary reimbursement rates for ABA‬
‭service providers PERMANENT.‬
‭Thank you for your efforts to ensure all MedQUEST beneficiaries, including children‬
‭with autism, have access to the life-changing, evidence-based care called ABA.‬

Aloha Chair Dela Cruz, and House Ways and Means Committee Members:  
   
My name is Rev. Dennis Barger (ret), and I have lived in Kihei, Maui for almost 13 
years.  I am an enthusiastic member of INDIVISIBLE-MAUI.   
 
I’m testifying in strong opposition to provisions in HB300 that expand mass 
incarceration and the building of a new $1 billion super jail.   
  
Budgets reveal what and who we care about. The proposed budget includes a multi-
million-dollar appropriation for the planning for a new OCCC.  We don’t need a new, 
billion-dollar jail.   
 
Instead, we NEED at least $1 billion to fund youth and education programs, affordable 
housing, job training, family strengthening and violence interruption programs, 
community-based health, treatment and reintegration programs rooted in evidence-
based practices, and restorative justice to help us build communities that are safe, 
healthy, and equitable.   
  
Mahalo for your consideration.

I strongly OPPOSE funneling state budget resources into the continuation of this reckless 
onslaught on our environment. This is NOT SAFE for the islands! How many experiments 
with Nature does the government need to do before you realize you are making things 
worse!?!?!? STOP poisoning the land with these franken-mosquitos!!!  
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
Dear Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair, and Members of the Committee on Ways and Means,       
My name is Jim Kilgore, and I am the Executive Director of Full Life. Full Life provides services  
through the Intellectual/Developmental Disabilities (I/DD) Home and Community Based Medicaid 
Waiver Program. We serve people with I/DD on Hawai‘i Island.  
We strongly support the following budget item in HB 300 HD1, scheduled for hearing on March 18, 
2025 at 10:00AM :  
HTH 501 – Developmental Disabilities, Page 25, Item NO. 18   
HTH 501 includes the addition of $10,100,000 for FY 26 and $21,400,000 FY 27 to increase 
urgently needed services through the Medicaid 1915(c) Home and Community-Based Services 
(HCBS) Waiver for Individuals with I/DD and their families.   
Why This Funding is Critical  
• 
Severe Workforce Shortage: Providers cannot offer competitive wages to Direct Support 
Professionals (DSPs), leading to a crisis in care.  
• 
Inadequate Reimbursement Rates: Rates have not kept pace with rising costs, putting 
services at risk.  
• 
Rate Study Findings: After the 2026 minimum wage increase, service costs will be 24% 
higher than current reimbursement rates. Federal Medicaid requires sufficient rates to 
ensure access to care.  
• 
Access & Equity: Funding supports workforce development, improves access on neighbor 
islands, expands employment opportunities, and increases residential options.  
• 
Preventing Service Cuts: Without funding, providers may reduce services or serve fewer 
individuals, leaving families without support.  
• 
Avoiding Institutionalization: Families should not have to choose between placing a loved 
one in a facility or leaving the workforce to provide care.  
• 
Cost-Saving Measure: HCBS services save the state $77,000 per person annually 
compared to institutional care. Medicaid Waiver funding also brings a $0.48 federal match 
per state dollar invested, saving taxpayers $300 million annually.  
  
This funding is essential to keeping families together, preventing unnecessary institutionalization, 
and ensuring individuals with I/DD receive the support they need to live independently.  
Mahalo for your time and consideration, and for the opportunity to testify in support of HB 300 HTH 
501.  
  
 
Full Life: person-centered support services filled with aloha spirit.

Comments:  
I strongly OPPOSE any funding for The State of Hawai‘i Department of Land and Natural 
Resources (DLNR) to continue dangerous mosquito release experiments anywhere in 
Hawai'i. HB 300 includes reference to novel strategies to address mosquito-borne avian malaria. 
Current strategies are focused on the release of millions of experimental Wolbachia-bacteria 
infected mosquitoes in our islands’ conservation areas and ecosystems. This is a reckless 
experiment and HUGE waste of tax payer dollars.  
Since spring 2022, as a veteran in National Security for over 33 years, I have personally studied 
the science in depth behind the use of Wolbachia for mosquito control. After reviewing 
thousands of pages of scientific papers, environmental assessments, government documents, 
videos, interviews, and grants related to Wolbachia; as well as consulting with experts regularly; 
what stands out from all this research is that Wolbachia bacterium strains are still being 
discovered and its impacts are yet to be fully understood. Its influence on other life forms; 
including humans, native birds, arthropods and filarial worms’ reproductive cycle and pathogen 
infection (either to block or promote) is still in process of being vetted. 
The state claims that the mosquito control strategy being implemented has decades of research 
behind it and is therefore safe. The reality is that the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) that these 
decades of research are based on irradiation-induced sterility, and this is not the technique being 
implemented. The Incompatible Insect Technique (IIT), based on Wolbachia-induced 
cytoplasmic incompatibility (a kind of male sterility), used on the Hawaiian Islands is something 
entirely different with a strong potential for contamination of surface water or ground water, 
leaching, runoff, and spray drift have also not been evaluated. 
The IIT method has never been used for conservation purposes or with the species Culex 
quinquefasciatus (southern house mosquito) anywhere worldwide. Federal documents admit the 
outcome is unknown and the public has already voiced numerous concerns. The IIT method 
"relies on the continuous production and release of male mosquitoes and is, therefore, more 
expensive than the World Mosquito Program's method. “There is no field evidence that it can 
reduce the risk of mosquito borne diseases.” 
https://www.worldmosquitoprogram.org/en/learn/how-our-method-compares 
40-year tropical disease expert Dr. Lorrin Pang provided testimony in court in August 2023 
about serious concerns about horizontal transmission of introduced bacteria, biopesticide wind 

drift of lab-altered mosquitoes into unintended areas, superinfection of mosquitoes with multiple 
bacteria strains, increased pathogen infection and disease-spreading capability in mosquitoes, 
and the experimental nature of the release plan. His concerns have STILL not be addressed. 
The Southern House Mosquito can transmit Avian Malaria, Avian Pox, Western Equine 
Encephalitis, West Nile Virus, Canine Heartworm, Lymphatic Filariasis/Elephantiasis, St. Louis 
Encephalitis and is a potential vector of Zika virus. There are Wolbachia studies that have shown 
it to increase pathogen infection.. 
“Mosquitoes infected with the bacteria Wolbachia are more likely to become infected with West 
Nile virus and more likely to transmit the virus to humans, according to a team of researchers.” 
"The results suggest that caution should be used when releasing Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes 
into nature to control vector-borne diseases of humans." 
https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/07/140710141628.htm

Wolbachia Can Enhance Plasmodium Infection in Mosquitoes: Implications for Malaria Control? 
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4154766/ 
Peer-reviewed studies have shown Wolbachia to cause mosquitoes to become more capable of 
transmitting avian malaria and West Nile virus (bird and human). Pathogen screenings for these 
lab-altered mosquitoes are unknown, and that information is being withheld from the public upon 
FOIA request. EPA guidelines allow for the release of thousands of female mosquitoes that bite, 
breed, and spread disease. Just 3 females that escaped in Singapore were able to start a new lab 
strain colony in the wild since lab strain females and males can mate. There are no known 
biosecurity protocols for the imported mosquitoes and no mitigation measures in place. 
Population replacement of wild mosquitoes with the lab-altered mosquitoes could cause 
significant impacts. 
Modified Mosquitoes Fail to Beat Malaria 
https://www.pressreader.com/canada/edmonton-journal/20181126/281951723871847 
“British biotechnology company Oxitec is withdrawing its application to release billions of 
genetically engineered mosquitoes in California, according to a recent update from the California 
Department of Pesticide Regulation.” 
https://beyondpesticides.org/dailynewsblog/2023/05/efficacy-and-health-issues-stop-release-of-
genetically-engineered-mosquitoes-in-california-florida-continues/ 
There are parallels between Genetically Modified (GM) and Wolbachia techniques. Biologically 
Wolbachia lab infected mosquitoes are not GM mosquitoes, but the study designs, math, and 

adherence to protocol apply to both situations. The main biological difference is there is slower 
horizontal transfer of mutations of the GM mosquito than with horizontal transfer of Wolbachia. 
This means Wolbachia as a natural gene drive has the potential to have greater unknown 
impact on the environment. Owain Edwards of CSIRO in Australia (Commonwealth Scientific 
and Industrial Research Organisation) was involved in the Aedes aegypti trial around Innisfail 
(Beebe et al 2021) that was funded by Verily Life Sciences. Dr. Edwards refers to Wolbachia as 
a type of natural gene drive during his 2016 presentation for APVMA. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lm_WS9eXYIU 
Its curious that the company Verily Life Sciences provding the mosquitoes in Hawai'i is funding 
the studies, this is a huge CONFLICT of INTEREST.  
“The evidence of horizontal spread of Wolbachia shows that the bacteria go not only to sexual 
cells, but also to somatic cells (non-sexual cells of the body). Wolbachia can also live outside of 
the intra-cellular systems for several months.” Wolbachia Horizontal Transmission Events in 
Ants: What Do We Know and What Can We Learn? https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30894837/ 
Horizontal Gene Transfer Between Wolbachia and the Mosquito Aedes aegypti 
https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-10-33 
This document submitted by Oxitec to the EPA in 2015 outlines numerous legitimate and studied 
issues regarding the use of Wolbachia. https://downloads.regulations.gov › EPA-HQ-OPP-2015-
0374-0018 › attachment_1.pdf 
“Wolbachia is a bacterium residing within the cells of insects, and is passed through vertical 
transmission from mother to offspring. Even a single Wolbachia infected female could lay 
hundreds of eggs that would invade the wild population, rendering the Incompatible Insect 
Technique ineffective and spreading a new strain of Wolbachia into the environment. Modelling 
has shown that conditions of lower competition can favour infected females [6-8]. In other 
words, as a mosquito population is reduced, or if a population is already low, the chances of 
Wolbachia invading the wild population are increased.” 
“The Wolbachia is an endosymbiont on the cytoplasm of the cell so over a thousand new genes 
are introduced into the insect cells, some or all of which have the potential to randomly integrate 
into the insect’s nuclear genome with unknown consequences. Moreover, the possible 
persistence of Wolbachia mosquitoes themselves is a significant concern. For the reasons set 
forth below, each new strain of mosquito, or indeed any artificially Wolbachia infected insect 
needs to be treated as a new strain and thoroughly tested in the laboratory before any field 
releases.” 
“The whole genome of Wolbachia can transfer to a host genome, meaning a host mosquito could 
be transformed with over one thousand new genes with unpredictable results [2-5].” 
“It has already been shown that horizontal gene transfer (HGT) can transfer genes between 
Wolbachia and its host in Aedes aegypti [12] and several other mosquito species [13]. Therefore, 
Wolbachia can genetically transform its host with functional genes with currently unknown 

consequences.” “Horizontal transmission between unrelated host species is a proven 
phenomenon in Wolbachia [25]. Studies have demonstrated that genetic sequences, ranging in 
size from Horizontal transmission between unrelated host species is a proven phenomenon in 
Wolbachia [25]. Studies have demonstrated that genetic sequences, ranging in size from single 
genes to entire bacterial genomes, have been transferred from Wolbachia to many of their insect 
hosts [2-5], and its effect on disease transmission is variable and potentially dangerous.” 
Lack of Bio-Security 
There has been no documentation offered to the public outlining risk analysis conducted on the 
security vulnerabilities for lab bred mosquitoes that can be utilized as bio-weapons against a 
population (intended) nor details of quality control mechanisms for accidental transmission of 
pathogens (unintended). This includes failure to discuss how they will deal with accidental 
female escape, wind drift, or how male lab bred culex q. mosquitoes released into the wild can 
pass pathogen to biting females thru mating and shared feeding/water sources. The public has no 
idea how these lab mosquitoes will be quality controlled and tested. This is a major National 
Security liability since mosquitoes are a vector of disease and have been used on multiple 
occasions against a population, even our own military. https://blackthen.com/operation-big-itch-
operation-drop-kick-fleas-infected-mosquitoes-dropped-black-towns/ 
Intended entomological warfare involves infecting insects with a pathogen and then dispersing 
the vectors over target areas. Invasive insects can also be deployed into a country en masse to 
take out crops and cripple a food supply. In New York the Plum Island lab was involved in the 
development of offensive bioweapons that led to Lyme's disease outbreaks. Japan’s biological 
warfare unit (Unit 731) was deployed against China during World War II. The unit deployed 
plague-infected fleas and cholera-infected flies to take out the Chinese. 
https://citizens.news/694097.html 
“We recommend careful invigilation of the international borders, airports, and seaports by the 
trained scientists to identify any accidental and/or deliberate import of alien arthropod vectors. 
Therefore, it is well advised to take seriously the possibility that arthropod could be used to 
attack people. Moreover, future research priorities should also includes high-throughput 
molecular diagnostics of diseases, identification of vectors, phylogenetic studies to understand 
the origin and distribution of the pathogen and vector strains. A rapid action team of trained 
scientist and health workers equipped with modern sophisticated diagnostic tools and suitable 
vector extinguishers should be appointed by the state and/or central health authorities to counter 
act any such emergency”. Bioterrorism on Six Legs by Dr. Manas Sarkar. 
A patent was developed in 2014 involving drones that transport and release mosquitoes. It 
mentions in the patent these drones can be co-opted for bio-weapons military programs. 
https://patents.google.com/patent/US8967029B1/en 
Page 23 of the Kaua’i EA states “By contrast, male’s proboscises are adapted to primarily feed 
on plant nectar and secretions, and do not feed on blood (Mullen and Durden 2009). Therefore, 
male mosquitoes cannot transmit disease.” This is incorrect and misleading to the public since 

studies prove male lab bred mosquitoes can pass pathogens to wild biting females thru mating 
and shared feeding/water sources. 
Venereal Transmission of St. Louis Encephalitis Virus by Culex quinquefasciatus Males

https://academic.oup.com/jme/article-abstract/27/3/334/2220754?login=false 
Wolbachia Has Been Implicated in Human Disease 
Wolbachia is NOT harmless to humans. It effects filarial worms that cause human disease such 
as river blindness and is implicated in Elephantiasis. These diseases effect millions of people 
each year. According to the CDC website, “There is a promising treatment using doxycycline 
that kills the adult worms by killing the Wolbachia bacteria on which the adult worms depend in 
order to survive”. https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/onchocerciasis/treatment.html 
“For decades, people have blamed a parasitic nematode worm for a disease that has blinded at 
least 250,000 people now living in Africa and South America. But the real culprit may be the 
ubiquitous Wolbachia, bacteria that colonize many hundreds of species, including the worm 
indicted in river blindness. Researchers now report that Wolbachia stimulate the severe 
immune system response that slowly robs people of their vision”.

Anti-Wolbachia therapy for onchocerciasis & lymphatic filariasis: Current perspectives 
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6755775/ 
In 2013 Lisa Crampton and Anouk Glad conducted a study of Plasmodium relictum infection in 
Culex quinquefasciatus. The rate of capture of adult mosquitoes and Plasmodium relictum 
percentage was extremely low at Alakai Plateau of Kaua’i. 
https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/jvec.12157 
Vol. 40, no. 2 Journal of Vector Ecology 225 
“The infection rate of Plasmodium relictum is also essential to understanding the transmission 
rate to birds on the Alakai Plateau. We screened 17 mosquitoes caught at Halepa’akai and 16 
mosquitoes caught at Kawaikoi in October and November for P. relictum infection using PCR. 
One mosquito from Halepa’akai tested positive for infection. We dissected 33 mosquitoes caught 
at Kawaikoi (winter and spring); none of them tested positive for infection by P. relictum 
(neither oocysts nor sporozoites were observed). Only three mosquitoes caught at Halepa’akai 
(January) were dissected, and none of them were infected (neither oocysts nor sporozoites were 
observed). Thus, the prevalence rate of P. relictum in our study is 1.45% (n=69).” 
Page 19 of Kaua’i EA states “Mosquito populations and avian malaria have recently expanded 
into higher elevation habitat, which is the last refugia for these endangered avian species.” I 
could not find a single reference study proving infected mosquitoes are invading higher 

elevations in the proposed release areas in Kaua’i or recent documentation on the prevalence rate 
of Plasmodium relictum since the Crampton and Glad study in 2013. 
Probably the biggest smoking gun of this entire money laundering operation is the fact that its 
not proven mosquitoes are actually causing the problem (study above is just one example). No 
one has looked into the increased EMF exposure, solar radiation, chemicals, pesticides, etc.. that 
could be affecting the birds while most have died in captivity (possibly due to EMF exposure of 
radio collars). Well meaning scientists are not helping these birds and we are conducting 
dangerous experiments on our ecosystem releasing lab bred vectors of disease that DO have the 
ability to create their own colony in the wild. There is no bio security, no proper studies, no end 
in sight. Please look into this mess and stop funding immediately!

Aloha, I am a resident of Kaneohe writing in strong support of HB 300. 
This kind of critical health care is one of the most powerful and cost-effective investments 
Hawaii can make. For every $1 invested in family planning, Hawaii saves at least $7 on 
unintended pregancy costs and long-term social costs that can be routed to other ciritcal 
services.  
On a personal level, I know how critical family planning clinics are to our community, and to 
people everywhere. They helped me decades ago when I was a teenager, and I'm fighting now 
for my daughter and women everywhere to have the same rights, care and protection that I had

I urge state funding to support novel strategies to address mosquito-borne avian malaria, 
including the incompatible insect technique currently being deployed on Maui and Kaua'i. This 
is an important effort to protect our endangered native forest birds from extinction, and buy time 
for other solutions to also be developed, as warming climate pushes the malaria-carrying 
mosquitoes further up into the forests.

To whom it may concern, 
Please support maintaining the increased QUEST provider payments for applied behavior 
analysis (ABA) services in the budget. These enhanced payments are vital for ensuring that 
children with autism have continued access to high-quality, evidence-based care that supports 
their development and overall well-being. ABA is a proven, effective intervention that can 
significantly improve communication, social skills, and independence in children with autism, 
and it is crucial that funding for these services remains robust. 
By maintaining these payments, we can ensure that providers are equipped to offer the best 
possible care, empowering families and helping children reach their full potential. Your support 
will make a lasting difference in the lives of children and families who rely on these services for 
growth, development, and future success.

I wish to state alarm and objection to the funding through HB300 HDI for release of 
Wolbachia bacteria-infected mosquitoes on Kauai and Maui.  In my mind there is too much at 
stake here to proceed wholesale with a novel, untested and invasive procedure.  Let's take the 
time to thoroughly study the potential impact of these mosquitoes instead of emotionally rushing 
pell mell into a theoretical solution that has the potential of wreaking havoc on our native 
ecosystem.  We are told that there is no time and that something has to be done NOW.  What is 
the guarantee that this something is not going to make things worse.  My understanding is that 
there is no monitoring of the effectiveness of the releases that are now occurring.  This is 
insane.  Haven't we learned from a history of rash species introductions that there are unintended 
consequences?  Brakes on, I implore you. Let us not be railroaded by emotional appeals with 
sloppy followup.

I support maintaining increased QUEST provider payments for applied behavior analysis. This 
is a highly needed service for those with Autism within the State of Hawaii. We are already 
severely understaffed and have a high need of children within our population. Our role often 
goes outside of scheduled hours in creating stimuli, collaborating with other providers, creating 
and maintaining detailed reports and data tracking for insurance, and labor intensive sessions 
directly with clients. These rate increases are a help at setting a fair rate for our market and I 
strongly support maintaining this recent incerase. 
Thank you for your time,

HB300 HD1- RELATING TO CTAHR’s Waimānalo CARES Center @ Waimānalo 
Research Station and Magoon Research and Teaching Station  
 
Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki, and members of the Senate Ways and Means Committee. 
Thank you for this opportunity to provide personal testimony in strong support of HB300 HD1 
relating to ongoing support for Waimānalo CARES Center @ Waimānalo Research Station and 
Magoon Research and Teaching Station at the University of Hawaiʻi, at Mānoa, College of 
Tropical Agriculture and Human Resilience (CTAHR). 
 
CTAHR, founding college of the University of Hawai‘i in 1907, serves as a leader in agriculture, 
biological engineering, food science and human nutrition, fashion design and merchandising, 
biotechnology, natural resources and environmental management, and family resources. 
 
To further advance the college in fulfilling the land-grant university’s three-part mission of 1) 
teaching; 2) research, and 3) Extension, CTAHR requires capital improvement resources to 
address security, theft, innovation, and aging facilities. Work at these facilities help to establish 
new agricultural industries (cacao, māmaki, tumeric, industrial hemp, speciality crops, etc) and 
also work to safeguard existing industries from new and invasive pests and diseases (coffee berry 
borer, avocado lacebug, little fire ant, coconut rhinoceros beetle, banana bunchy top virus, etc.)  
 
Similar to chefs having access to state-of-the-art facilities such as the Culinary Institute of the 
Pacific, doctors and nurses have teaching hospitals, athletes have stadiums, and teachers have 
classrooms, Hawaiʻi farmers depend on the science based research and farmer focused 
educational trainings conducted on CTAHR’s research stations across the state to advance and 
sustain their diversified agriculture businesses. Capital improvement funds will go towards 
ensuring research data is safeguarded and help to advance CTAHR’s teaching, research and 
extension facilities for years to come.  
 
With 85-90% of our food imported, increasing food self-sufficiency is a state wide priority. Both, 
Waimānalo Research Station and Magoon Research and Teaching Station play vital roles in 
providing Hawaiʻi-specific, science-based information, which supports the Hawaiʻi State 
Legislature’s Hawaiʻi 2050 Sustainability Plan, “to increase production and consumption of local 
foods and products, particularly agricultural products.” 
 
Legislative support is needed for much needed capital improvements to ensure the long-term 
sustainability of Hawaiʻs diversified agriculture industry.  
 
I believe that bill HB 300 HD1 has much merit. Ongoing funding to support CTAHR’s 
teaching, research and Extension educational programs are crucial to the sustainability of 
Hawaii’s diversified agriculture. Thank you for the opportunity to express my strong 
personal support for HB300 HD1.

Testimony in Strong Support of  
House Bill 300 H.D.1 
RELATING TO THE STATE BUDGET. 
Adjusts and requests appropriations for fiscal biennium 2025-2027 funding 
requirements for operations and capital improvement projects of Executive Branch 
agencies and programs. 
 
Edward N. Chu 
President and Chief Executive Officer  
Hawaii Health Systems Corporation 
 
On behalf of the Hawaii Health Systems Corporation (HHSC) Corporate Board of Directors, 
thank you for the opportunity to present testimony in support with requested amendments 
to H.B. 300 H.D.1 that adjusts and requests appropriations for fiscal biennium 2025-2027 
funding requirements for operations and capital improvement projects of Executive Branch 
agencies and programs.   
 
Background 
 
Hawaii Health Systems Corporation (HHSC) plays a vital role in the healthcare delivery 
system for the State of Hawaii. In fiscal year 2024, HHSC’s acute discharges for the four 
HHSC regions were 14,017, which accounts for approximately 13% of all acute care 
discharges in the State of Hawaii.  In fiscal year 2024, HHSC’s emergency department visits 
for the four HHSC regions were 91,459, representing approximately 19% of all emergency 
department visits statewide.   
 
The impact of HHSC’s facilities on the neighbor islands is even more impressive.   
 For residents of the County of Hawaii, HHSC’s facilities cared for over 70% of all acute 
care discharges and 81% of all emergency department visits. 

 For residents of the County of Kauai, HHSC’s facilities cared for approximately 22% of 
all acute care discharges and 40% of all emergency department visits. 
 
HHSC Budget Request 
 
HHSC-Regions Fiscal Years 2026-2027 Budget Request (HTH210 & 212) 
 
Please note that the funding amounts and requests under HTH 212 do not include the Oahu 
Region of HHSC, as Act 248, SLH 2022, established a new organization code for the HHSC-
Oahu Region (HTH 215).  As a result, HTH 212 (HHSC-Regions) is now comprised of the 
HHSC East Hawaii, West Hawaii, and Kauai Regions. 
 
For fiscal year 2024, the HTH 212 general fund appropriation represented approximately 22% 
of total expenditures (including both operating and non-operating expenses). The requested 
HTH 212 general fund appropriations for fiscal years 2026 and 2027 are projected to be 
about 24% and 22%, respectively, of total expenditures. Maintaining this funding ratio 
consistent with prior years is a notable accomplishment considering the significant increases 
in costs over the years. 
 
The amount of HHSC’s request appears larger than it would normally be because the ARPA 
funds and general fund appropriations HHSC received in fiscal years 2022 and 2023 and 
additional general fund appropriations in fiscal year 2025 were marked as nonrecurring. 
These nonrecurring amounts total approximately $76 million that was reduced from HHSC’s 
fiscal year 2024 and 2025 funding amounts resulting in a base is that is below this year’s 
expenditures. The justification for HHSC’s requests are shown below: 
 
Details for the loss of supplemental pandemic related funding are as follows: First, HHSC 
received Federal Provider Relief Fund grants totaling approximately $63.5 million from fiscal 
year 2020 through fiscal year 2022 that provided HHSC with the working capital needed to 
lower its general fund appropriation needs in fiscal years 2022 and 2023.  In addition, HHSC 
received $19.8 million in SBA Paycheck Protection Program loans, which also lowered the 
need for HHSC to receive general fund appropriations in fiscal years 2022 and 2023.  A third 
factor are the changes in the DHS uncompensated care payments of $19.2 million to HHSC 
was a result of the federal Coronavirus state of emergency. 

 
These federal funds helped to finance the State mandated increases in fringe benefit rates 
and prior unfunded collective bargaining raises during fiscal years 2022 and 2023. Together, 
federal funds received provided approximately $102 million in funding that would otherwise 
have to come out of general fund appropriations. These federal funds do not even address 
the increase in costs associated with the unfunded mandates such as healthcare inflation 
costs, collective bargaining pay and fringe benefit rate increases for fiscal years 2024 to 
2027. 
 
For example, HHSC labor costs are well above industry norms with a fringe benefit rate of 
64% as a state agency, compared to the average private Hawaii hospital fringe benefit rate of 
30%. Based on HHSC’s salaries expense, that difference alone represents $90 million of 
HHSC’s need for general fund appropriations. 
 
In November 2025, the East Hawaii region will be implementing a new electronic medical 
record (EMR) system that will meet the needs of its providers and staff, providing a platform 
with enhanced workflows, functionality, and the ability to collaborate with other hospitals 
within Hawaii. The $13.2 million in fiscal year 2026 and $2.3 million in fiscal year 2027 for 
information technology (IT) infrastructure costs represent the resource costs needed to build 
and support the system on an ongoing basis. There are other HHSC regions exploring the 
opportunity to join the EMR system at a future date. 
 
A summary of the amounts appropriated for fiscal years 2024 and 2025, the total funding 
requested by HHSC-Regions for fiscal years 2026 and 2027, Governor’s decision for fiscal 
years 2026 and 2027, and HB300 HD1 results for fiscal years 2026 and 2027 are 
summarized below. 
 
 
 
 
In conclusion, HHSC is unable to keep up with collective bargaining pay increases and future 
mandated increases in the fringe rate for pension and retiree health insurance costs (OPEB). 
Access to high-quality healthcare services in Hawaii’s rural communities is a growing need 
and HHSC is uniquely positioned to meet the State of Hawaii’s constitutional obligation to 
ensure that those communities receive the healthcare services they deserve as citizens of 
the State of Hawaii. HHSC is respectfully requesting approval of its full funding request at a 
total funding level of $216,537,303 in fiscal year 2026 and $199,816,303 in fiscal year 
2027. 
 
Impact of Potential Federal Cuts and Other Actions 
 

With the recent shift in Federal administration and the federal budget reconciliation process, 
healthcare providers are very concerned with potential changes in funding, regulations, and 
healthcare policies, which could affect access to care, financial stability, and operational 
practices. The changes in federal funding for Medicare and Medicaid could lead to reduced 
reimbursement rates, affecting hospital revenues, or cuts in supplemental payments. 
Medicare and Medicaid make up 74 percent of HHSC revenues and so any reduction in 
federal funding for these government payors will have a substantial financial impact to HHSC 
facilities. 
 
The biggest impact to HHSC from potential cuts to the State MedQUEST program would be 
the potential loss of uncompensated care funds. HHSC receives approximately $60 million 
annually in revenue through the public hospital uncompensated care pool, which provides 
federal funds to partially subsidize HHSC’s losses from providing care to Medicaid, Med-
QUEST, and uninsured patients. The Federal administration is currently scrutinizing these 
state-directed payments as a possible way to reduce federal Medicaid spending. Should the 
Federal administration decide to put a stop to the state-directed payment method, HHSC 
would work with the State MedQUEST program to develop a new method of obtaining federal 
funding for this financially underserved patient population. However, this new method would 
take time to develop and would require approval from the Federal administration before a 
new method could be implemented.  Moreover, many experts believe that the states’ federal 
medical assistance percentage (FMAP) will be a target for cuts, which directly affects the 
uncompensated care funding calculation. For HHSC, a reduction in the FMAP by 10% could 
result in a $6 million decrease in uncompensated care funding. 
 
It is difficult to quantify some of the direct impacts to potential cuts to MedQUEST funding, but 
if the ability of MedQUEST to provide coverage to its current membership is compromised, 
the impact to HHSC could be a shift in payment status from MedQUEST coverage to 
uninsured, which would have a negative impact on HHSC reimbursements.   
 
Based on potential Medicare cuts identified by MedPAC (the nonpartisan independent 
legislative branch agency that provides Congress with policy advice on the Medicare 
program), the Congressional Budget Office, and the Office of Inspector General, the potential 
decrease in Medicare payments for our HHSC facilities over the next ten years could be as 
much as $291 million.  The largest impact of these potential cuts would come from the 
elimination of enhanced payments to Hilo Benioff Medical Center and Kona Community 
Hospital as a result of their Sole Community Hospital designation, which would decrease 
funding by $14.6 million in fiscal year 2026 and $15.4 million in fiscal year 2027 and $167.3 
million over ten years (2026-2035). The expiration of the expanded Low Volume Hospital 
(LVH) adjustment program would negatively impact HHSC by $1 million in both fiscal years 
2026 and 2027, with a decrease of $11.1 million over ten years. The potential elimination of 
the enhanced reimbursement for critical access hospitals (CAH) would be devastating to 
access to care in Hawaii’s rural communities, as HHSC operates five CAH facilities on the 
islands of Hawaii and Kauai.  HHSC’s CAH facilities could see decreases in funding of $7.2 
million in fiscal year 2026 and $8.1 million in fiscal year 2027, with a total of $86.8 million over 
ten years.  
 

On March 4, 2025, the Federal Administration imposed a 25% tariff on imports from Canada 
and Mexico, and a 10% tariff on goods from China. However, the tariff on Chinese imports 
was increased to 20%. On March 6, the 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico were suspended, 
with exemptions set to expire on April 2. Additionally, tariffs of 25% on steel and aluminum 
imports are scheduled to take effect on March 12, with Canada and Mexico being the top 
exporters to U.S. markets. 
 
The healthcare industry heavily depends on imports from Canada, China, and Mexico, 
including pharmaceutical ingredients and medical devices. Hospitals also rely on imported 
supplies such as gowns, gloves, syringes, and larger equipment like CT scanners and X-ray 
machines. These new tariffs are expected to drive up healthcare costs, disrupt supply chains, 
and ultimately make care less affordable for patients. For HHSC’s spending on critical supply 
items such as food, pharmacy, purchased services, capital, lab, and other supplies, HHSC’s 
conservative estimate of the impact of the tariffs are an increase in costs between $1 million 
to $1.6 million annually.  
 
Other concerns that could have a negative impact on our HHSC facilities include a pause or 
reduction in federal grants and financial assistance, changes to the 340B drug discount 
pricing program, changes to telehealth policy, and increased regulatory burdens and 
compliance costs instead of focus on patient care. 
 
It is important to note that the impacts listed above regarding federal cuts and other actions 
are not included in our current funding request for fiscal years 2026 and 2027. 
 
Capital Request 
 
For HTH 212, HHSC-Regions, lump sum capital appropriations for the Hawaii Region of 
$5,500,000 for fiscal year 2026 and $4,300,000 for fiscal year 2027 will not meet our needs to 
support the maintenance of our aging facilities and renovation and expansion of our facilities 
on Hawaii Island. HHSC is requesting total funding of $10,500,000 for fiscal year 2026 and 
$8,350,000 in lump sum capital appropriations for fiscal year 2027 for the Hawaii Region.

No studies have been done on the potential significant impacts of these projects or on the serious 
risks to the health of our islands’ people, wildlife, and ‘āina. No environmental impact statement 
(EIS) has been completed for any island.

I strongly oppose HB300. Please stop all funding regarding this mosquito project on Maui and

My name is Kristin Clark and I am a Hawaii resident living in Honolulu. I am writing to oppose 
HB 300 regarding funds for a new jail. We don't need money for another place for incarcerated 
people, we need that money to fund youth program that invest in the future. We need to create 
community and belonging for formerly incarcerated people so they believe in their worth. There 
are a multitude of evidenced-based programs we can use to prevent incarceration, build our 
youth, support those out on parole of exiting the system. Spend money on proactive things. We 
do not need another space to lock people away.

COMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS 
Senator Donovan M. Dela Cruz, Chair 
Senator Sharon Y. Moriwaki, Vice Chair 
  
Tuesday, March 18, 2025 
TIME: 10:00 AM 
 Conference Room 211 & Videoconference 
State Capitol 
415 South Beretania Street 
  
SUPPORT HB300 RELATING TO THE STATE BUDGET 
  
Honorable Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki, and Members of the Committee, 
On behalf of the Hawaiʻi Association for Behavior Analysis (HABA), we sincerely thank you for 
including Medicaid rate increases for Applied Behavioral Analysis services for children with 
autism in last year’s budget bill. After nearly a decade of stagnant rates, 2025 finally brings an 
increase—but the funds that were passed were nonrecurring, meaning they are only secured for 
2025. We urge you to maintain the appropriation for this included in the Executive Budget 
submitted for this year’s budget bill to maintain the increased rates and prevent disruptions in 
services for families who depend on them. It is imperative we preserve health care payments 
now before any potential Medicaid cuts are made.  
Applied Behavioral Analysis is a medically necessary service covered under QUEST for 
individuals under 21 with an autism diagnosis, as mandated by federal law through the Early 
and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment (EPSDT) benefit (Social Security Act 
§1905(r)). EPSDT ensures that children receive comprehensive and necessary healthcare 
services, including Applied Behavioral Analysis, and remains a protected federal mandate. 
Given its focus on children, EPSDT funding is unlikely to face federal cuts if there are reductions 
to Medicaid. However, while the federal government requires coverage, states play a critical role 
in determining reimbursement rates and ensuring providers can continue offering services. 
Without adequate state funding, access to care remains limited, and families face significant 
barriers to obtaining the support their children need. 
As noted in the recent Applied Behavioral Analysis rate study (DC233), providers continue to 
face workforce shortages due to low reimbursement rates, leading to long waitlists and 
limited access to services, particularly on neighbor islands. Some providers have even stopped 
accepting QUEST due to unsustainable rates. Without competitive reimbursement, families will 
continue to struggle to access the services their children desperately need.  

 
 
The Legislature took an important first step by increasing rates last session, but these were 
just made available on 01/01/2025 and many providers are still working on their updated 
contracts with the QUEST health plans therefore not yet able to bill the increased rates. 
However, we know that without maintaining these adjustments, providers will not be able to 
offer competitive pay and will likely lose staff, resulting in families facing uncertainty about their 
children’s care or being unable to access care at all. Investing in Applied Behavioral Analysis 
services now ensures children receive early intervention, reducing long-term costs and allowing 
them to reach their full potential. 
We urge you to maintain funds for QUEST Applied Behavioral Analysis rates in the DHS 
budget appropriations to secure a sustainable future for Applied Behavioral Analysis 
services in Hawaiʻi. Thank you for your time and consideration.

I strongly oppose this funding. This is a very bad idea. 
As you know, every time a inhabitant or guest of Hawaii lands in the state, they must fill out a 
form to state that they are not bringing any animals, plants or insects into Hawaii, that could 
upset the ecosystem. As one of the people who brought my cats into Hawaii, I can testify to the 
exhaustive steps taken to inusre the animals do not have rabies. 
You do see the irony, yes? 
Not only this, but the agencies releasing these lab-altered mosquitoes does not  monitor the 
effects of the experimental mosquitoes on forest birds. 
Can anyone explain the purpose of this experment in light of the non-scientific procedure 
happening thus far? 
Seriously, stop with the nonsense. Help Lahaina victims above any other funding.

Written Statement of 
Sandi Kanemori 
Interim Executive Director 
Hawai`i Technology Development Corporation 
before the 
Senate Committee On Ways and Means 
Tuesday, March 18, 2025 
10:00 AM 
Conference Room 211 & Videoconference 
In consideration of 
HB300 HD1 
RELATING TO STATE BUDGET. 
 
Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki, and Members of the Committee. 
 
The Hawai`i Technology Development Corporation (HTDC) strongly SUPPORTS 
HB300 HD1, which adjusts and requests appropriations for fiscal biennium 2025-2026 funding 
requirements for operations and capital improvement projects of Executive Branch agencies and 
programs. 
 
This bill includes allocations for grants through HTDC to support businesses via the 
Small Business Innovation Research (HSBIR) Grant Program, the Manufacturing Assistance 
Program (MAP), and the Small Business Training/Accelerator Program. These initiatives are 
instrumental in fostering technology advancement, economic diversification, and sustainable 
business growth for small to medium-sized enterprises in Hawai`i. 
 
Alignment with DBEDT’s Economic Landscape Framework 
 
HTDC is undergoing a comprehensive review and restructuring of its core programs—
SBIR, MAP, and Accelerator—to align with DBEDT’s Incubation to Maturity framework as 
outlined in The Economic Landscape of Hawai`i. This approach ensures that innovation-driven 
businesses are supported through every phase of growth, from research and development to 
commercialization and scale-up. 
 
Small Business Innovation Research Program (HSBIR) 
The SBIR program has been instrumental in securing federal funding for Hawai‘i-based 
companies, leveraging state investments to attract non-dilutive federal capital. Since 1989, 
HTDC has provided Phase I matching grants, and in FY16, expanded to Phase II and III 
matching grants. These investments have led to a 70% transition rate from Phase II to Phase 
III—far exceeding the national average.  
 
As part of DBEDT’s strategic vision, SBIR funding will be further integrated with 
HTDC’s commercialization initiatives, ensuring that research-intensive businesses transition

smoothly into scalable operations within Hawai‘i’s economy. This aligns with DBEDT’s focus 
on strengthening economic anchors while cultivating high-growth industries such as advanced 
manufacturing, energy technology, and creative media. 
 
A summary of the Phase II/III awards made by the matching grant program is listed 
below: 
 
 
The data indicates a consistent upward trend in the Federal funding awarded to the 
industry annually. Federal SBIR funds are highly competitive, with a fixed budget allocated each 
year. Consequently, the industry is securing federal funds for Hawai‘i that might otherwise be 
awarded to companies in other states. Each year, the number of qualified applicants exceeds the 
available funding. Since the Phase II/III program's inception in FY16, no applicant has received 
the full eligible amount. Over time, this program is expected to produce similar success metrics 
as the Phase I matching program. 
 
 Manufacturing Development Program (MAP) 
Recognizing the crucial role of manufacturing in Hawai‘i’s economic diversification, MAP is 
currently being reviewed and restructured to directly connect innovation with production 
capabilities. Through this restructuring, MAP will: 
• 
Expand its scope beyond traditional manufacturing support to include technology 
commercialization and advanced production methods. 
 
• 
Enhance integration with SBIR recipients, ensuring that research-driven businesses can 
scale their innovations into full-fledged production operations within Hawai‘i. 
 
• 
Align with DBEDT’s Economic Landscape vision by supporting value-added 
manufacturing that enhances export potential, workforce development, and local supply 
chain resilience.

Every year, there have been more qualified applicants than available funds. The funding  
awarded to companies provides a partial reimbursement (20%) for equipment upgrades and other 
eligible expenses. 
 
HTDC’s Innovate Hawai‘i program will continue to provide technical assistance, 
business mentorship, and capacity-building support to MAP grantees, ensuring that local 
manufacturers are globally competitive. 
 
Small Business Training & Accelerator Program 
 
Since 2018, HTDC has supported accelerator and training programs that serve as catalysts for 
new company formation within priority industry sectors. Moving forward, these programs will 
be restructured to: 
 
• Create a more seamless pipeline from incubation to commercialization, ensuring 
businesses receive sustained support beyond initial launch phases. 
 
• Expand collaboration with university-led incubators and private sector accelerators, 
strengthening DBEDT’s Cradle to Career approach for workforce development. 
 
• 
Integrate wrap-around services, such as investment readiness training, supply chain 
connections, and technology adoption support, to help early-stage businesses scale 
efficiently.

I’m opposed to Executive Budget funding through HB300 for Wolbachia-bacteria-infected 
mosquito releases on Maui and Kaua‘i.  Here are some of the reasons, as follows > 
• 
Accidental release of female mosquitoes that bite, breed, and spread disease (EPA 
guidelines allow for the release of one female for every 250,000 males; just one female 
released can produce 160,000 more females through breeding of the generations in her 
lifespan; 3,103 females are allowed to be released weekly on Maui – up to 6,000 
mosquitoes released twice weekly per acre in the 64,666-acre project area: 6,000 x 2 x 
64,666 = 775,992,000 mosquitoes divided by 250,000 equals 3,103 females weekly) 
• 
Peer-reviewed studies showing Wolbachia bacteria can cause increased pathogen 
infection and disease-spreading capability in mosquitoes 
• 
Horizontal transmission of Wolbachia bacteria to wild mosquitoes and other insect 
vectors of disease 
• 
Population replacement of wild mosquitoes with lab-altered mosquitoes (as few as three 
females released can cause population replacement) 
• 
Wind drift of released mosquitoes to unintended areas

Please vote NO on HB 300. Do not open the door to release millions of 
experimental Wolbachia-bacteria infected mosquitoes in our islands’ conservation areas and 
fragile ecosystems. This will cause more health problems for our ohana and you will be 
blamed.  Please consider another alternate. 
Mahalo for voting no,

Re:  
Support, HB300 HD1, Relating to the State Budget  
 
 
Aloha Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki, and Members of the Committee,  
 
On behalf of the Hawai‘i True Cost Coalition, we are writing in support of HB300 HD1, Relating to the 
State Budget.  
 
The Hawai‘i True Cost Coalition (TCC) represents over 70 nonprofit organizations serving more than 
500,000 residents statewide. We advocate for sustainable government funding to cover the true costs of 
essential services provided by Hawai‘i’s community-based nonprofits (CBOs). 
 
HB300 HD1 is crucial to maintaining services for vulnerable populations, including kupuna, children, 
individuals experiencing homelessness, and survivors of domestic violence. Without adequate funding, 
critical programs—such as health care, housing assistance, and legal aid—are at risk due to recent 
federal funding challenges. 
 
This bill reinforces the state’s commitment to Hawai‘i’s safety net by increasing funding for essential 
programs through the Department of Health, Department of Human Services, and Judiciary. These 
investments will support behavioral health services, food security initiatives, housing programs, legal 
aid, and much more.  
 
Many CBO contracts have remained stagnant for over a decade, despite rising costs. Nonprofits have 
stretched their own limited resources to sustain these programs, but this is no longer sustainable. 
Increased state funding is necessary to ensure these services continue for those who rely on them. 
 
HB300 HD1 is an investment in Hawai‘i’s people and future resilience. Mahalo for your time and 
consideration.

Re:  
The Imperative of Allocating Adequate Funding to Protect Natural Resources  
 
 
Support HB300 HD1, Relating to the State Budget  
 
Aloha kākou, 
 
On behalf of our coalition’s leadership committee, we are writing in support of HB300 HD1, Relating to 
the State Budget. We are voicing our strong support for funding for natural resource protection and 
restoration. The Care for ‘Āina Now Coalition is on a mission to conserve our cultural and natural 
resources and invest in our ʻāina to keep our community safe.  
 
The health of Hawai‘i’s environment is inextricably linked to the health of our people, communities, and 
future generations. Our natural and cultural resources provide over $6 billion in value to our economy 
each year, and stewardship of these resources have been underfunded for decades. It’s been estimated 
that we currently face a conservation funding gap of $560 million per year. Today, this underinvestment 
continues to be a liability and risk to public safety. The more time that passes without healing our 
environment, the more lives, places, and communities are at risk of being harmed. 
 
Our primary focus is adequate, permanent funding for the Department of Land and Natural Resources 
and community organizations to support stewardship and restoration of our natural resources. There are 
simple ways our State can safeguard our ʻāina and people including passing legislation that ensures 
allocation of funds for wildfire prevention and ecosystem resilience.  We will continue to advocate for 
measures that generate new funding sources to complement the expenditures the legislature will 
approve in the budget. 
 
This coalition, which works on the frontlines of natural and cultural resource management across the 
State, applauds the legislature for continuing to consider these solutions. We urge you to consider the 
crucial need for sustainable, broad-based investment to meet the immense challenges our environment 
faces, offset the impact left by nearly 10 million annual visitors, and invest in the long-term health of our 
communities. Hawaiʻi’s natural resources are invaluable to the livelihoods of our local residents and 
integral drivers of our statewide economy as well as our visitor industry. 
 
Mahalo for the opportunity to testify on this important measure.

I’m opposed to Executive Budget funding through HB300 for Wolbachia-bacteria-infected 
mosquito releases on Maui and Kaua‘i. 
Since late 2023, DLNR and their partners Birds, Not Mosquitoes have released countless 
Wolbachia-bacteria-infected mosquitoes on the fragile ecosystems of Maui and Kaua‘i. No 
studies have been done on the possible significant impacts of these projects or the serious risks to 
the health of our islands’ people, wildlife, and ‘āina. No environmental impact statement (EIS) 
has been completed for any island. The many risks to this project include: 
• 
Accidental release of female mosquitoes that bite, breed, and spread 
• 
Possible increased pathogen infection and disease-spreading capability 
• 
Horizontal transmission of Wolbachia bacteria to wild mosquitoes and other insect 
vectors of disease 
• 
Wind drift of released mosquitoes to unintended areas 
• 
Lack of documented biosecurity protocols and pathogen screenings for the imported 
mosquitoes 
• 
Risks to the health of people and animals, and the potential for the plan to cause the 
extinction of the native birds it is meant to protect 
The agencies releasing these lab-altered mosquitoes have admitted that the plan does not include 
monitoring the effects of the experimental mosquitoes on forest birds. Since mass release of 
these mosquitoes began on Maui in November 2023, there has been no indication that the plan is 
even working for its intended purpose. 
Deviations from the approved plan have also been occurring for over a year. Mosquitoes are 
being released solely by helicopter rather than by drone, increasing concerns about noise 
disturbances, disruptions to wildlife habitat, and the potential for collisions, accidents, and 
wildland fires. Helicopters appear to be flying closer to the tree canopy than the approved 
distance, increasing the potential for adverse impacts. 
I ask that the legislature amend bill HB300 to remove any State of Hawai‘i Executive Budget 
funding allocations for programs and/or projects that include the release of Wolbachia-bacteria-
infected mosquitoes. Conservation efforts and funding must focus on more environmentally 
sound approaches like habitat and stream flow restoration, which would honor the ‘āina, the 

culture, and the ancestral connections of the native birds rather than putting them at further risk 
of extinction. 
Thank you for doing the right thing for our precious island and all its living things.

WAM Chair and Representatives, 
I urge you to support the $3 million for family planning to ensure low-income and underinsured 
patients can continue accessing reproductive healthcare. In these uncertain times, we cannot 
afford to short change women's health. Women in low-income situations should not have 
to decide between reproductive healthcare and feeding their families.  
Spend more on social programs to PREVENT the need for a new prison.

Hawai`i State Senate Ways and Means Committee 
Hearing March 18, 2025, at 10:00 AM 
 
Aloha Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki, and Committee Members: ​
   
My name is Christine Andrews, and I live in Wailuku, Maui. I’m testifying in opposition to provisions in 
HB300 that expand mass incarceration and the building of a new $1 billion super jail.   
 Budgets reveal what and who we care about. The proposed budget includes an appropriation for the 
building of a new OCCC, but we don’t need a new, $1 billion jail. Instead, we need to fund youth and 
education programs, affordable housing, job training, family strengthening and violence interruption 
programs, community-based health, treatment and reintegration programs rooted in evidence-based 
practices, and restorative justice to help us build communities that are safe, healthy, and equitable.   
I am also testifying in support of family planning funding via HB300. 
 
Safety net providers are facing a perfect storm of rising health care costs, workforce shortages, and with 
increased abortion patient volumes, and providers across the country are struggling to keep up, leading to 
clinic closures, layoffs, and reduction of services. On top of these challenges, we all know the hostile 
administration in Washington, D.C. is threatening to make devastating cuts to critical health care services. 
 
I am asking you to invest in sexual and reproductive health care to make sure providers can continue to 
deliver care. Your investment will help our community, and a lack of investment will create great harm.  
 
Impact on Family Planning Services 
●​
As the leading safety net family planning provider in Hawaiʻi, I request the state budget include $3 
million in family planning monies, ensuring low-income and underinsured patients can continue 
accessing essential health care services. 
●​
This funding is essential to maintain patients’ access to safety-net planning services, including 
education, counseling, and access to contraception.  
 
Why investing in sexual and reproductive health care is good for the community  
●​
Sexual and reproductive health care is one of the most powerful and cost-effective investments 
Hawaiʻi can make.  
●​
For every $1 invested in family planning, Hawaiʻi saves at least $7 on unintended 
pregnancy costs and long-term social costs that can be routed to other critical services.  
●​
Any lack of investment in family planning safety net care exacerbates the disparities experienced 
by Medicaid Patients who have been systematically excluded and harmed, including Black, 
Indigenous and Native, and Latinx communities.  
 
I encourage the Committee to make the right choice for Hawai`i, invest in our communities health, 
vibrancy and well-being. We do not need prisons, we need investment in the people of Hawai`i. 
 
Mahalo,

I support maintaining increased QUEST provider payments for applied behavior analysis (ABA) 
services. As a Board Certified Behavior Analyst (BCBA), I have witnessed firsthand how these 
services transform lives, helping children, adolescents, and adults gain essential communication, 
social, and independent living skills that enhance their quality of life. ABA is not just a 
treatment—it is a vital service that empowers individuals and families to build meaningful 
futures. 
Maintaining increased QUEST provider payments is critical to ensuring access to services for 
families in need. Many families across Hawai‘i rely on QUEST coverage for ABA therapy. 
Without adequate reimbursement rates, clinics may be forced to reduce services or close, leaving 
families without access to the critical interventions they need. This disproportionately affects 
underserved and rural communities, where access to specialized services is already limited.  It is 
also essential to retain highly qualified providers. Hawai‘i already faces a shortage of qualified 
BCBAs and RBTs. Maintaining QUEST provider payment increases ensures that we can retain 
skilled professionals, provide competitive wages, and continue to build a strong workforce 
dedicated to serving our keiki. If reimbursement rates decrease, providers may leave the field or 
relocate to other states, worsening waitlists and access gaps. 
Ensuring high-quality, ethical care requires stable funding. ABA services require intensive, 
individualized programming and highly trained professionals to ensure ethical and effective 
treatment. Without adequate funding, providers may be forced to reduce service hours, 
compromise staff training, or limit supervision, all of which negatively impact the quality of care 
and outcomes for individuals receiving ABA services.  Investing in early and consistent ABA 
intervention leads to greater independence, reduced need for long-term support services, and 
increased opportunities for education and employment. Research shows that quality ABA 
services reduce long-term costs associated with special education, residential care, and other 
support systems. Maintaining QUEST funding is not just an investment in individuals today—it 
is an investment in Hawai‘i’s future. 
As a provider, I go above and beyond to ensure that families receive consistent, culturally 
responsive, and high-quality ABA services. This includes training and mentoring RBTs to 
strengthen the workforce, collaborating with schools and families to provide seamless, 
community-based care, and ensuring ethical, research-based interventions that promote 
meaningful progress for individuals of all abilities. But we cannot do this work without the 

continued support of QUEST funding. Cutting reimbursement rates would place an enormous 
strain on providers and families, limiting access to services that so many rely on. 
I urge the committee to support maintaining increased QUEST provider payments for ABA 
services so that we can continue to serve Hawai‘i’s keiki, build a strong behavioral health 
workforce, and create a future where individuals with autism and developmental disabilities have 
the resources they need to thrive.

Dear, Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki, and members of the Committee on Ways and 
Means, 
 
Thank you for the opportunity to present testimony on HB300. AF3IRM Hawai‘i respectfully 
asks the Committee to please include $3 million for family planning in the budget. This 
funding will be the only way some low-income and underinsured patients can access essential 
health care. Among these patients are domestic violence victims and survivors that need other 
financial options to access reproductive care that does not threaten their confidentiality or safety. 
 
With the rise in unemployment and economic strain, we absolutely will see domestic violence 
rates go up along with the need to rely on safety-net planning services. This funding is critical 
and any lack of investment in family planning safety-net care exacerbates the disparities 
experienced by Medicaid patients and those who are systemically underserved and have more 
barriers accessing resources. Black, Indigenous, women of color, LGBTQ+ folks, including 
survivors of domestic violence will be most impacted by a lack of investment.  
 
Please pass HB300 with $3 million for family planning so trusted providers like Planned 
Parenthood are able to continue to provide life saving care including education, counseling and 
access to contraception. Mahalo for the opportunity to testify on this measure. 
 
Sincerely,  
AF3IRM Hawaiʻi

population through restorative justice, and that includes funding for healthcare, public education,

Aloha Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki, and Committee Members:  
My name is Colleen Rost-Banik, and I am a resident of Waikiki. I am also a Sociology Instructor 
at UH Manoa and a volunteer instructor for a Creative Writing Project at the Women's 
Community Correctional Center. I’m testifying in opposition to provisions in HB300 that expand 
mass incarceration and the building of a new $1 billion super jail.  
The new super jail simply does not make sense; it is not needed. It significantly expands the 
capacity of the jail when many of the people in jail do not belong there. Roughly 40% of those in 
jail are houseless, many struggle with addiction, and many are held simply because they can't 
afford cash bail. These are not good reasons to be in jail. Investing in other forms of assistance is 
a much better use of our tax dollars, not to mention a much smarter way to keep our communities 
safe. Also, please recall that our state has already invested $65 million in building jail facilities 
for women via the expantion project at the Women's Community Correctional Center. Investing 
another billion dollars in the carceral system rather than addressing the roots of why people are 
incarcerated is simply unethical and irresponsible on a number of levels. 
As you well know, budgets reveal what and who we care about. The proposed budget includes an 
appropriation for the building of a new OCCC, but we don’t need a new, $1 billion jail. Instead, 
we need to fund youth and education programs, affordable housing, job training, family 
strengthening and violence interruption programs, community-based health, treatment and 
reintegration programs rooted in and connected to cultural healing, and restorative justice to help 
us build communities that are safe, healthy, and equitable for all.  
Mahalo for your time and consideration.

Dear Chair and Members of the Senate Ways and Means Committee, 
 
Aloha Nui! 
 
I am writing to express my strong support for including $5.5 million for the 
Waimānalo CARES Center and $6 million for the Magoon Research and Teaching 
Station in the state budget bill, HB 300, HD1. These allocations are crucial for our 
community and will significantly impact both the residents of Waimānalo and the 
broader educational and research efforts in Hawaii. 
 
Waimānalo CARES Center: 
The Waimānalo CARES Center plays a vital role in providing essential services and 
support to the local community. This funding will enable the center to enhance its 
programs, expand its reach, and improve the quality of life for residents. By investing in 
this center, we are investing in the well-being and prosperity of our community. 
 
Magoon Research and Teaching Station: 
The Magoon Research and Teaching Station is an important educational and research 
facility that contributes significantly to Hawaii's academic and environmental initiatives. 
This funding will support critical research projects, educational programs, and 
community engagement activities, ultimately benefiting both students and the broader 
community. 
 
I urge you to approve these allocations as they represent a wise investment in 
our state's future. These projects align with the values of community support, 
education, and environmental stewardship that are essential to Hawaii's growth and 
prosperity. 
Mahalo Nui for considering my testimony. I look forward to your support for these 
important initiatives. 
 
Mahalo,

Tes$mony in support of HB 300 HD1, Rela$ng to The State Budget 
 
Aloha Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki, and Committee Members, 
 
We write in support of HB 300 HD1, Relating to the State Budget Housing. Specifically, we write 
in support of funding a study of civil service position classifications and compensation and 
funding the modernization our tax system to allow for the IRS’s Direct File Program to be used 
in Hawaiʻi.  
 
Title Guaranty of Hawai‘i is the oldest and largest Ttle company in the state. We have been 
owned and operated by a kamaʻāina family since 1896 and we are proud to employ over 250 
residents who work in our branches across the state.  
 
Efficient government and financial stability for working families are key to a thriving local 
economy. The persistent vacancy crisis in state agencies slows permitting, licensing, and public 
assistance programs—delays that hurt both workers and businesses. Funding a comprehensive 
study regarding classifications and compensation is a necessary first step to filling these state 
jobs, which will create stable employment, ensure that essential services run smoothly, and 
allow families to focus on their jobs instead of bureaucratic backlogs. 
 
Additionally, implementing the IRS Direct File program for Hawaiʻi residents would be a game-
changer for working families and entrepreneurs. High tax preparation costs and predatory 
refund anticipation loans siphon money out of our communities. A free, streamlined tax-filing 
option means more families can save, invest, and spend locally, boosting small businesses. This 
item is a smart investment in affordability and economic growth.

Statement of 
Meli James and Brittany Heyd 
Cofounders 
Mana Up  
 
HB300 HD1, Relating to The State Budget 
 
Aloha Chair Yamashita, Vice Chair Takenouchi, and Committee Members, 
 
We support HB 300, The State Budget Bill. In particular, we support funding: 
 
1. A civil service position classification and compensation study; 
2. Consultant services to maintain Tax System Modernization (TSM) projects; and  
3. Positions to establish a Tax System Modernization Office and integrate the Internal Revenue 
Services' Direct File Project with TSM. 
 
Mana Up is a statewide initiative that helps provide entrepreneurs in Hawai‘i with the resources and tools 
to grow their business and scale globally. As these entrepreneurs continue to grow, they also help 
contribute to our expanding our local economy. As part of our mission, we aim to sustain the local 
economy through economic diversification, local job creation, community giveback, investment, and a 
regenerative culture of entrepreneurship – providing a better future for generations to come here in 
Hawai‘i.  
 
These items provide critical funding to help reduce vacancies in state government jobs and implements 
the IRS Direct File program at the state level.  Filling vacancies in state employment will improve essential 
public services, while Direct File will eliminate filing fees and maximize tax refunds for families who need 
them most. 
 
At a time when families are struggling with rising costs, these items offer both immediate and long-term 
relief. A well-staffed state workforce means more efficient public services, from healthcare to housing 
assistance, reducing bureaucratic delays that can create financial hardship. Meanwhile, implementing the 
Direct File program ensures that every dollar earned by working families stays in their pockets, rather 
than being spent on tax preparation fees. Investing in these programs makes economic sense and 
strengthens the financial security of families across our state. 
 
Sincerely,

Re: 
 
 
 
 
Testimony of HPM Building Supply in Support  
 
Dear Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki, and Committee Members: 
  
I would like to submit this testimony in support of HB300 HD1, Relating to the State Budget. 
Specifically, I support the following budget items: 
 
1. $1,750,000 for FY 26 for the Department of Human Resources Development (DHRD) to 
conduct a civil service position classification and compensation study; 
2. Adds $338,150 for FY 26 and $1,343,400 for FY 27 for consultant services to maintain Tax 
System Modernization (TSM) projects; and  
3. Adds 6.00 permanent positions and $282,296 for FY 26 and 6.00 permanent positions and 
$564,592 for FY 27 for the Department of Taxation (DOTAX) to establish a Tax System 
Modernization Office and integrate the Internal Revenue Services' Direct File Project with TSM. 
  
HPM Building Supply is a 100% employee-owned company serving Hawaii's home improvement 
market and building industry for over 100 years since 1921. With 18 locations across Hawai‘i and 
Washington State, HPM offers various services and products, including retail stores, building supply 
and lumber yards, home design centers, drafting and design services, and manufacturing facilities. 
HPM is dedicated to enhancing homes, improving lives, and transforming communities.   
 
Ensuring our state remains affordable for working families requires bold action to strengthen economic 
security. Today, thousands of state government jobs remain vacant, leading to reduced services and 
economic instability for our communities. By investing in a study to modernize our civil servant position 
classification and compensation can improve recruitment and retention efforts, which will help connect 
residents with stable, middle-class careers that offer competitive wages, benefits, and long-term 
financial security. Filling these positions will also improve essential services that working families rely 
on, from education to public safety. 
 
Additionally, implementing a state-level Direct File system would ease the financial burden of tax 
preparation, allowing families to file their taxes for free instead of paying costly private services. This 
initiative would put more money back into the pockets of hardworking residents—money that can go 
toward rent, groceries, and childcare instead of tax prep fees. Together, these programs will create 
pathways to economic stability. 
 
Sincerely,

We write in support of two items in HB 300 HD1, funding (1) for a civil service position 
classification and compensation study, and (2) to integrate the Internal Revenue Services’ Direct 
File Project with Tax System Modernization. 
Tori Richard has manufactured in Honolulu for nearly 70 years, and we continue to proudly do so 
today. As a long-time medium-sized Hawai‘i employer, we recognize the struggles facing many 
families in living comfortably in a place with a high cost of living, and how improving government 
efficiency can make the lives of residents a little easier.  
Two areas in which HB 300 HD1 supports government efficiency in a way that will assist  a 
thriving state economy. A thriving economy depends on a strong workforce and policies that 
reduce financial burdens on working families. The persistent vacancies in state government jobs 
mean thousands of residents are missing out on secure, well-paying career opportunities. 
Investing in a study that will ultimately help filling these roles will not only put more people to 
work but will also strengthen consumer spending, which directly benefits local businesses. When 
more residents have stable incomes, they can afford housing, childcare, and essential goods—
boosting economic activity across our state. 
Furthermore, implementing Direct File in Hawai‘i would help working families and small 
business owners alike. By providing a free and streamlined way to file taxes, this initiative 
removes unnecessary costs and complexity from the tax system, reducing financial stress on 
residents. Families should not have to choose between paying for tax filing services and covering 
essential expenses. Supporting these items is a smart, cost-effective way to promote affordability 
and economic prosperity for all. 
 
 
Sincerely,

Aloha, 
My name is Carla Allison and I live in Honolulu. As a member of the Reimagining Public Safety 
in Hawai'i Coalition, I support a state budget that increases investments in services and programs 
that build safe and healthy communities. 
We are respectfully requesting that you significantly increase investments in the following areas, 
proven by research and data to dramatically increase safety by diverting residents out of the 
criminal justice system and addressing the root causes of poverty, crime, and violence. 
• 
Permanent supportive housing and transitional housing 
• 
Community based mental health services 
• 
Youth programs 
• 
Vocational/employment training for living wage jobs 
• 
Restorative Justice and Ho'oponopono 
At least 40% of all people in jail in Hawai'i are homeless. There is consensus among justice 
system actors-including judges, prosecutors, and service providers- that people suffering from 
mental illness and substance abuse disorder should be diverted out of jail and into treatment and 
housing. This would dramatically shrink the jail population, but to succeed, the state must fund 
diversion infrastructure.  
We are also in a time of fiscal crisis, and the state cannot afford to adequately fund diversion 
while also spending enormous amounts on expanding jails and prisons. Given this reality, please 
remove appropriations for the following projects. 
• 
$30 MIL for planning and design of OCCC jail 
• 
$10 for DCR Statewide Master Plan 
• 
Millions more for jail and prison expansion 
As our elected representatives, you have the opportunity to finally move our state past the failed 
approach of funding more policing and incarceration which has not made us safer, toward the 
proven strategy of funding services and programs that address the root causes of poverty, crime, 
and violence. 

Thank you. 
Carla Allison - Honolulu

Aloha Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki, and WAM Committee Members, 
As a taxpaying citizen concerned with wasteful expenditures, I write in STRONG OPPOSITION 
to provisions in HB300 that expand mass incarceration and the building of a new $1 billion super 
jail. 
The proposed budget includes an appropriation for the building of a new OCCC, but we don’t 
need a new, $1 billion jail. Instead, we need to fund youth and education programs, affordable 
housing, job training, family strengthening and violence interruption programs, community-
based health, treatment and reintegration programs rooted in evidence-based practices, and 
restorative justice to help us build communities that are safe, healthy, and equitable.

Honorable Donovan Dela Cruz, Chair 
Senate Ways and Means Committee 
Hawaii State Capitol 
Honolulu, HI 96813 
 
Re: Support for House Bill 300 HD1 with Specific Appropriations 
 
Dear Chair Dela Cruz and Members of the Senate Ways and Means Committee, 
 
The Waimānalo Hawaiian Homes Association (WHHA) has four purposes. Among them are the 
following: promoting the welfare of our members in home, school, church and community; 
raising the standards of home life of our members; and securing adequate laws for the care and 
protection of the property and children of our members. To those ends, we write in support for 
the inclusion of $5.5 million for the Waimānalo CARES Center and $6 million for the Magoon 
Research and Teaching Station in the State budget bill, HB 300 HD1. These allocations are 
crucial for our community and will have a significant positive impact on the residents of 
Waimānalo and the broader educational and research efforts in Hawaii. 
 
Waimānalo CARES Center. The Waimānalo CARES Center plays a vital role in providing 
essential services and support to the local community. This funding will enable the center to 
enhance its programs, expand its reach, and improve the quality of life for residents. By investing 
in this center, we are investing in the well-being and prosperity of our community. 
 
Magoon Research and Teaching Station. The Magoon Research and Teaching Station is an 
important educational and research facility that contributes significantly to Hawaii's academic 
and environmental initiatives. This funding will support critical research projects, educational 
programs, and community engagement activities, ultimately benefiting both students and the 
broader community. 
 
WHHA urges you to approve these allocations as they represent a wise investment in our state's 
future and, more importantly, to our residents’ future. These projects align with our purposes, 
including promoting welfare, raising the standards of home life, and the care and protection that 
are essential to our members’ growth and prosperity.

Please amend bill HB300 to remove any State of Hawai‘i Executive Budget funding allocations 
for programs and/or projects that include the release of Wolbachia-bacteria-infected mosquitoes. 
No studies have been done on the potential significant impacts of these projects or on the serious 
risks to the health of our islands’ people, wildlife, and ‘āina. No environmental impact statement 
(EIS) has been completed for any island. 
Conservation efforts and funding must focus on more environmentally sound approaches like 
habitat and stream flow restoration, which would honor the ‘āina, the culture, and the ancestral 
connections of the native birds rather than putting them at further risk of extinction. 
The agencies releasing these lab-altered mosquitoes have admitted that the plan does not include 
monitoring the effects of the experimental mosquitoes on forest birds.

Aloha, 
Save Medicaid Hawaii supports including $3 million in family planning to ensure low-income 
and underinsured patients can continue accessing reproductive healthcare. During the first Trump 
administration, restrictions on the use of federal family planning funds were so 
onerous, controlling and ideological that many providers, including community health 
centers,  withdrew from the program; the State of Hawaii eventually withdrew from the federal 
FP Program and the Legislature found state funds to only partially cover this loss.  As you are 
well aware, the losses will likely be far steeper during Trump 2.0.  And please do NOT fund $30 
million for planning the proposed new jail to replace OCCC, nor $10 million for a 10-year 
Department of Corrections Statewide Master Plan.  We should be funding healthcare, public 
education, free meals, and affordable housing, before funding a new prison.

to maintain patients’ access to safety-net planning services, including education, counseling, and

unintended pregnancy costs and long-term social costs that can be routed to other critical 
services.  
Thank you for supporting HB 300 and supporting reproductive healthcare for low-income, 
underinsured patients.  HB 300 is a wise, humane, and cost effective investment in the health of 
our communities.

Hello, 
 
I am requesting that you allocate at least $3M of the state budget to financially support family 
planning and access to sexual and reproductive health resources for those who don't have 
insurance, are low-income, live in rural areas, and face additional systemic barriers such as 
racism, xenophobia, ableism, and homophobia, such as those who are Black, Native Hawaiian, 
Latinx, LGBTQ+, and disabled. At least $7 for every $1 invested in family planning can be 
saved for services such as community outreach, affordable housing, mental health, and reform. A 
concrete action could be financially supporting healthcare organizations such as the Hawai'i 
Health and Harm Reduction Center and the Planned Parenthood clinic just a few blocks away 
from the State Captiol that provide reproductive and sexual health services such as education, 
STI testing, contraceptives, and counseling. 
I believe that the national government has failed to support the betterment of sexual and 
reproductive health by limiting access to unbiased information about human sexuality through 
funding abstinence-only programs, relying on conservative values on sex, and criminalizing, 
banning, and removing protections on abortion. This sends a message that sexuality is taboo and 
shameful to talk about, which can affect people's physical and mental wellbeing. Limiting access 
to information about LGBTQ+ identities, for example, can make someone who thinks they may 
be LGBTQ+ think negatively about themselves rather than feeling supported if they had 
resources that affirmed them. I think financially supporting resources for the betterment of sexual 
and reproductive health can help people decide if they want to have sex or not, which can be a 
solution for unplanned pregnancies and for those who are considering pregancy or are not ready 
to be pregnant, as pregnancy can be financially and time-consuming in preparing for and raising 
a child.

Testimony Presented Before the 
Senate Committee on Ways and Means 
March 18, 2025 at 10:00 a.m., Room 211 and Via Video Conference 
by 
T. Samuel Shomaker, MD, Dean 
and 
Lee Buenconsejo-Lum, MD, Associate Dean for Academic Affairs  
John A. Burns School of Medicine 
University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa 
 
HB 300, HD1 – RELATING TO THE STATE BUDGET 
Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki, and members of the Committee: 
Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony in SUPPORT of HB 300, HD1, 
specifically as it relates to the John A. Burns School of Medicine’s (JABSOM) line item 
110 and the additional state funding to ensure full coverage of JABSOM’s Kakaʻako 
Health & Wellness revenue bond debt service payments. Full debt service coverage will 
mitigate potential medical school accreditation status forfeitures if future Tobacco 
Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) annual allocations to UH continue to decline.  The 
funding requested in HB 300, HD1 for the debt service is $1.1M for fiscal year 2025-
2026 and $1.5M for fiscal year 2026-2027. 
 
From the opening of the JABSOM Kakaʻako Health and Wellness campus in 2005, the 
Hawaiʻi State Legislature has awarded a portion of Hawaii's annual MSA funding to 
cover the medical school's Kakaʻako Health and Wellness campus revenue bond debt 
service. The National Association of Attorneys General (NAAG), who oversees the 
U.S.'s Tobacco MSA, predicted that the annual MSA payments to the participating 
states would decline over time.  MSA payment levels are affected by U.S. inflation, U.S. 
cigarette and roll-your-own tobacco consumption, and cigarette manufacturers' income. 
NAAG has not published a forecasted future payment schedule; however, a few 
participating states (e.g., Colorado) have forecasted annual MSA state payment 
declines between 3% and 8% in any given year. 
 
In April 2024, the MSA payment to Hawaiʻi of $36,425,172.62 was 11% less than the 
prior year’s payment of $40,862,842.25. Due to this MSA payment reduction, for the first 
time, the medical school’s annual MSA allocation of $8,833,034.88 will not fully cover 
the medical school’s FY2025 bond debt service obligation of $9,395,723 (i.e., a 
shortage of $562,688). The medical school’s Kakaʻako Health and Wellness revenue 
bond debt service payments end on July 1, 2033. 
 
If the April 2025 MSA payment declines by 11% or higher, the medical school will 
be forced to use its tuition allocation. The use of our tuition allocation for debt 
service will reduce faculty and staff personnel due to the lack of compensation coverage 
(i.e., it is equivalent to 14 teaching faculty or 27 academic support staff or a combination 

2 
 
of both). Loss of medical school personnel will pose a threat to the medical school’s 
accreditation for its medical students from the Liaison Committee on Medical Education 
(LCME) and accreditation for its MD resident trainee programs from the Accreditation 
Council of Graduate Medical Education (ACGME). Continued accreditation is essential 
to support medical school student enrollment (e.g., all degrees and residency 
programs), research opportunities, community service, health systems support, and the 
medical school’s ability to increase the physician workforce for Hawaiʻi. 
 
JABSOM is training more students than ever before.  Faced with a physician shortage 
of about 750 physicians in the state when compared to other continental US 
jurisdictions, we expanded our class size to help meet the worsening doctor shortage.  
Our third-year medical students now have the option of doing part of their training in 
Hilo, West Hawai‘i and North Hawai‘i, Maui and Kaua‘i.  First-year and fourth-year 
medical students have the opportunity for elective rotations on the islands of Hawai‘i, 
Maui, Kaua‘i and Moloka‘i.  Nearly two thirds of our graduates will remain in Hawai’i to 
practice medicine, one of the nation’s highest retention rates.  These are bold steps 
taken to realize the dream of former Governor Burns to allow Hawai’i’s children to 
become some of Hawai’i’s most valuable citizens, i.e., those who commit their lives to 
improve the health of others. 
 
Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony on this measure.

Aloha / It is important that the state budget include $3 million in family planning monies, 
ensuring low-income and underinsured patients can continue accessing essential health care 
services. 
    •    This funding is essential to maintain patients’ access to safety-net planning services, 
including education, counseling, and access to contraception.  
Why investing in sexual and reproductive health care is good for the community  
    •    Sexual and reproductive health care is one of the most powerful and cost-effective 
investments Hawaiʻi can make.  
    •    For every $1 invested in family planning, Hawaiʻi saves at least $7 on unintended 
pregnancy costs and long-term social costs that can be routed to other critical services.  
    •    Any lack of investment in family planning safety net care exacerbates the disparities 
experienced by Medicaid Patients who have been systematically excluded and harmed, including

Members of the Committee on Ways and Means 
 
From: Jeanne Y. Ohta 
 
RE:  HB 300 HD1 Relating to the State Budget 
 
POSITION: SUPPORT 
 
I am writing to request that the state budget provides funding for family planning services to 
ensure that low-income and underinsured patients can continue accessing essential services by 
local providers. This funding is needed to maintain patients’ access to safety-net planning 
services, including education, counseling, and access to contraception. 
 
Providing sexual and reproductive health care is cost effective. For every $1 invested in family 
planning, Hawai‘i saves at least $7 on unintended pregnancy costs and long-term social costs 
that can be routed to other critical services. 
 
Reducing support for family planning safety net care compounds the disparities experienced by 
Medicaid patients who are systematically marginalized, increasing harms to their health. 
 
I respectfully ask the committee to include $3 million for family planning in our state budget. 
Thank you for the opportunity to provide my testimony in support of family planning.

**Testimony in Opposition to HB300 – Department of Land and Natural Resources Budget for 
2025-27**   
To the Honorable Members of the Hawaiʻi State Legislature, 
I am Tiare Smith, a Native Hawaiian born and raised in Kahaluʻu, Oʻahu, where I have resided 
for 45 years. As a kamaʻāina deeply rooted in this ʻāina, I write to oppose HB300, which 
allocates state funding through the Department of Land and Natural Resources (DLNR) 
Executive Budget for 2025-27 to perpetuate experimental mosquito release programs on Maui 
and Kauaʻi. While I acknowledge the urgent need to address avian malaria’s devastating impact 
on our native forest birds, I find the proposed strategy—releasing millions of Wolbachia-infected 
mosquitoes into our fragile ecosystems—precipitously reckless, scientifically questionable, and 
antithetical to the principles of environmental justice and cultural stewardship that define our 
Hawaiian heritage. Below, I outline the pros and cons of this bill and propose alternative 
solutions that prioritize safety, efficacy, cost-effectiveness, and equity. 
### Pros of HB300 
1. **Conservation Intent**: The bill reflects a commendable commitment to combating avian 
malaria, a mosquito-borne disease that has driven many Hawaiian honeycreepers to the brink of 
extinction. Species like the ʻakikiki and kiwikiu face imminent loss without intervention. 
2. **Innovative Approach**: The use of Wolbachia-based Incompatible Insect Technique (IIT) 
represents a novel strategy, leveraging a naturally occurring bacterium to suppress mosquito 
populations. Successful precedents in human disease control (e.g., dengue suppression in 
Australia) suggest potential efficacy. 
3. **Federal Collaboration**: The DLNR’s partnership with agencies like the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service indicates a coordinated effort, potentially amplifying resources and expertise. 
### Cons of HB300 
1. **Environmental Risk**: Releasing millions of experimental mosquitoes into conservation 
areas—such as the Alakaʻi Wilderness and Haleakalā National Park—threatens fragile 
ecosystems already burdened by invasive species. The long-term ecological consequences of 

introducing Wolbachia-altered organisms remain inadequately studied, risking unintended 
disruptions to native flora and fauna. 
2. **Scientific Uncertainty**: While IIT has shown promise elsewhere, its application to avian 
malaria in Hawaiʻi’s unique ecosystems lacks robust, localized data. A 2014 study noted that 
Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes may, under certain conditions, enhance malaria transmission—a 
possibility dismissed too cavalierly by proponents. This uncertainty undermines claims of 
efficacy. 
3. **Cost Inefficiency**: The budget allocation for rearing, transporting, and releasing millions 
of mosquitoes via drones and helicopters is exorbitant. Preliminary estimates suggest costs in the 
millions annually, diverting funds from proven conservation methods. 
4. **Equity and Cultural Disenfranchisement**: Native Hawaiian communities, like mine in 
Kahaluʻu, have not been meaningfully consulted. This top-down approach sidelines our voices, 
violating the principle of kuleana and our right to steward the ʻāina. The potential for ecological 
harm further threatens cultural practices tied to healthy ecosystems. 
### Detailed Solutions to Address the Cons 
To mitigate these concerns, I propose the following alternatives, which align with safety, 
efficacy, cost-effectiveness, and equity while safeguarding our native birds and ecosystems: 
1. **Enhanced Predator and Habitat Management (Safety and Efficacy)**   
   - **Solution**: Intensify efforts to control rats and feral pigs, which exacerbate avian malaria 
by creating mosquito breeding sites and preying on bird nests. Deploy targeted trapping and 
fencing in key conservation areas.   
   - **Cost-Effectiveness**: Rat traps cost approximately $5–$10 each, and fencing averages 
$20–$30 per linear foot. A $500,000 investment could secure 5,000 traps and 10 miles of 
fencing, protecting 10,000 acres—far less than the millions required for mosquito releases.   
   - **Equity**: Engage local hunters and community groups in predator control, fostering 
economic opportunities and cultural participation.   
   - **Impact**: Reducing breeding sites directly lowers mosquito populations, complementing 
bird survival without experimental risks. 
2. **Natural Vector Control via Native Species (Safety and Efficacy)**   
   - **Solution**: Introduce or bolster populations of native predators like the Hawaiian 
damselfly (Megalagrion spp.), which prey on mosquito larvae. Pilot projects could test their 
reintroduction in wetlands near conservation zones.   

   - **Cost-Effectiveness**: Rearing and releasing damselflies costs an estimated $50,000 per 
site, with a one-time investment yielding self-sustaining populations—saving millions over 
recurring mosquito releases.   
   - **Equity**: Partner with Native Hawaiian scientists and cultural practitioners to oversee 
restoration, ensuring alignment with traditional ecological knowledge.   
   - **Impact**: This leverages natural systems, avoiding synthetic interventions while 
supporting biodiversity. 
3. **Community-Driven Monitoring and Research (Cost-Effectiveness and Equity)**   
   - **Solution**: Fund citizen science programs to monitor mosquito and bird populations, 
paired with university-led studies on avian malaria resistance. Allocate resources to explore 
genetic resilience in honeycreepers rather than altering mosquitoes.   
   - **Cost-Effectiveness**: A $200,000 annual grant could train 100 community members and 
support graduate research, yielding data at a fraction of IIT’s cost (estimated at $5–$10 million 
yearly).   
   - **Equity**: Empower rural and Native Hawaiian communities with paid roles, ensuring their 
voices shape policy and science.   
   - **Impact**: This builds long-term capacity and prioritizes non-invasive solutions, reducing 
ecological risk. 
4. **Legislative Oversight and Impact Assessment (Safety and Equity)**   
   - **Solution**: Mandate a comprehensive Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) before 
further funding, as opposed to the less rigorous Environmental Assessment used thus far. 
Require public hearings in affected communities.   
   - **Cost-Effectiveness**: An EIS costs $100,000–$200,000, a modest price for informed 
decision-making that could prevent billions in ecological damage.   
   - **Equity**: Ensure Native Hawaiian representation on review panels, rectifying the 
disenfranchisement of our people.   
   - **Impact**: This enforces accountability, halting reckless experimentation until risks are 
fully understood. 
### Conclusion 
HB300, as currently framed, funnels scarce state resources into a speculative and perilous 
venture that jeopardizes our ecosystems and sidelines Native Hawaiian voices. I urge you to 
reject this funding and redirect it toward safer, more equitable, and cost-effective alternatives. 

Our native birds deserve protection, but not at the expense of the very ʻāina that sustains them—
and us. Let us honor our kuleana by choosing solutions that respect both science and sovereignty. 
Mahalo nui loa for your consideration. 
Respectfully,   
Tiare Smith   
Kahaluʻu, Oʻahu

Aloha,  
My name is Luanna Peterson and I live in Honolulu. As a member of the Reimagining Public 
Safety in Hawai'i Coalition, I support a state budget that increases investments in services and 
programs that build safe and healthy communities. 
We are respectfully requesting that you significantly increase investments in the following areas, 
which are proven by research and data to dramatically increase safety by diverting residents out 
of the criminal justice system and addressing the root causes of poverty, crime, and violence. 
• 
Permanent supportive housing and transitional housing 
• 
Community based mental health services 
• 
Youth programs 
• 
Vocational/employment training for living wage jobs 
• 
Restorative Justice and Ho'oponopono 
At least 40% of all people in jail in Hawai'i are homeless. There is consensus among justice 
system actors-including judges, prosecutors, and service providers- that people suffering from 
mental illness and substance abuse disorder should be diverted out of jail and into treatment and 
housing. This would dramatically shrink the jail population, but to succeed, the state must fund 
diversion infrastructure.   
We are also in a time of fiscal crisis, and the state cannot afford to adequately fund diversion 
while also spending enormous amounts on expanding jails and prisons. Given this reality, please 
remove appropriations for the following projects.  
  
• 
$30 MIL for planning and design of OCCC jail 
• 
$10 for DCR Statewide Master Plan 
• 
Millions more for jail and prison expansion 
As our elected representatives, you have the opportunity to finally move our state past the failed 
approach of funding more policing and incarceration which has not made us safer, toward the 

proven strategy of funding services and programs that address the root causes of poverty, crime, 
and violence.  
Mahalo for your time and consideration, 
Luanna Peterson

Aloha Chair and Members of the Committee, 
  
I am writing in strong support of HB300, which provides essential funding for critical health care 
services in our state. Now more than ever, we must invest in sexual and reproductive health care 
to ensure that providers, like Planned Parenthood, can continue to deliver life-saving care to our 
communities. 
  
Safety net providers like Planned Parenthood are facing a perfect storm. Rising health care costs, 
workforce shortages, and increased abortion patient volumes—especially in the wake of 
restrictive policies in other states—are pushing providers to their limits. Clinics across the 
country are being forced to reduce services, lay off staff, or close entirely due to a lack of 
funding. Without state investment, Hawaii could face the same devastating consequences, 
leaving countless individuals without access to essential care. 
  
Planned Parenthood is a lifeline for many in our community, providing affordable and accessible 
health care, including birth control, STI testing and treatment, cancer screenings, prenatal care, 
and abortion services. For many patients, especially those who are uninsured or underinsured, 
Planned Parenthood is their only option for reproductive health care. If we fail to fund these 
services, people in Hawaii will be left without critical care, leading to increased unintended 
pregnancies, higher maternal health risks, and worsened public health outcomes. 
  
Additionally, the hostile administration in Washington, D.C. is threatening to cut federal funding 
for critical health care services. If these cuts move forward, Hawaii’s health care system will be 
further strained, making state investment even more crucial. 
  

Failure to invest in sexual and reproductive health care will create serious harm to our 
communities, disproportionately impacting low-income individuals, people of color, and those in 
rural areas who already face barriers to care. Without adequate funding, patients will experience 
longer wait times, reduced access to contraceptives, prenatal care, STI treatment, and abortion 
services. 
  
HB300 is an opportunity for Hawaii to stand up for health care, equity, and the well-being of our 
communities. I strongly urge you to fully fund HB300 to protect access to essential health care 
services and ensure that providers like Planned Parenthood can continue to serve those who need 
them most. 
  
Mahalo for your time and consideration.

“9. HAWAII UNITES, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation v. BOARD OF LAND AND 
NATURAL RESOURCES, STATE OF HAWAI‘I, and DEPARTMENT OF LAND AND 
NATURAL RESOURCES, STATE OF HAWAI‘I, 
Contesting the deployment of military biotechnologies on an experimental and 
emergency permit, on the pretext of ‘conservation. 
Court proceedings to stop 775,992,000 biopesticide lab-reared Wolbachia-bacteria-
infected mosquitoes per week. 807 billion over 20 years, still on an emergency 
permit; with no Environmental Impact Assessment, in the fragile ecosystems of East 
Maui. 
Plaintiff Lia, on behalf of Hawaii Unites, verbally requested a contested case hearing 
for agenda item C-2 “Request Approval of Final Environmental Assessment and 
Authorization for the Chairperson to Issue a Finding of No Significant Impact for the 
‘Suppression of Invasive Mosquito populations to Reduce Transmission of Avian 
Malaria to Threatened and Endangered Forest Birds on East Maui’” 
 
On March 13, 2023, Plaintiff Lia filed a complaint on behalf of Hawaii Unites with the 
State of Hawai‘i Office of the Ombudsman, requesting an investigation into the BLNR 
for interference with the public’s ability to testify at the BLNR meeting on March 10, 

2023. Per Tina Lia’s complaint, the BLNR Secretary emailed incorrect and 
inoperative information for providing video testimony at the meeting. The BLNR then 
rearranged the agenda items at the March 10, 2023, meeting in random order with 
no explanation to the public waiting to testify. Testifiers for the biopesticide mosquito 
project agenda item were made to sit through the entire eight-hour meeting, reduce 
their testimony from three minutes to two minutes each, and listen to the BLNR 
members joking and laughing about the postponement of the biopesticide mosquito 
project agenda item. 
Hawaii Unites has repeatedly presented documented, compelling evidence of the 
risks and impacts of the biopesticide mosquito project to the BLNR. Rather than 
acknowledge and address the organization’s concerns, the BLNR has acted in a 
consistently dismissive and disruptive manner towards this testimony. The rights of 
Hawaii Unites, of the organization’s supporters, and of the public, to open 
governmental processes have been infringed upon by the BLNR in their effort to 
silence discussion about the risks and impacts of the project. 
 
Hawaii Unites dispute that BLNR’s powers include the authority to “adopt rules”; 
“appoint hearing officers to conduct public hearings”; bring enforcement actions; and 
establish “restrictions, requirements, or conditions …relating to the use of particular 
land being disposed of, the terms of sale, lease, license, or permit, and the 
qualifications of any person to draw, bid, or negotiate for public land. “Land” is 
defined to include “all interests therein and natural resources including water.”

Timeline by Margaret Denmead 
On September 19th 2023, I Margaret Denmead received a message from a friend, it 
was an Instagram post from that the Mayor of Denpasar saying that from November 
2023 to April 2024 the Denpasar City Government Bali would massively distribute 
Aedes Aegypti mosquito in North, south, east and west Denpasar.  The Mosquito 
eggs will be exposed to Wolbachia bacteria as an effort to optimize prevention of the 
spread of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). 
https://www.instagram.com/p/CxNITlcr9py/?igshid=NjFhOGMzYTE3ZQ== 
Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever is the most serious of four distinct strain of Dengue, and 
it is the most rare with no cases on the island. 
 
Frances was in Bali at the time and sent she had the white papers called Gene 
Edited Mosquitoes from a Microbial Perspective, Bioweapons and notes on Green 
Technologies from a Genetically Engineered Microbial Perspective, to prove that 

these mosquitoes were genetically modified and not ‘natural’ and ‘harmless’ as 
claimed by the World Mosquito Program (WMP). These papers proved the 
impossibility of risk assessment for the short, medium or long term of gene editing 
and bio tech research. 
 
 
September 22nd we forwarded documents and a report to share with the ministers to 
encourage them to attend a meeting. This report was called the 8 ways in which 
Genetically engineered mosquitoes are a biological attack on Bali and resulted in 
many ministers attending the meeting.  
 
HOW THE GENETICALLY ENGINEERED (GE) MOSQUITOES ARE A 
BIOLOGICAL ATTACK ON BALI. 
 
 
THE DISEASES MOSQUITOES CARRY: 
 
Dengue, Zika, Malaria Etc - have been genetically engineered and patented.  
This means that they have been given Gains Of Function in pharmaceutical and 
military laboratories, to make them more contagious and more fatal. 
 
 An example is Zika which had mild flu symptoms. Following the release of GE 
mosquitoes in Brazil, Zika in those areas became a disease that caused deformed 
heads for new babies and death. In the last two months, cases of Malaria have been 
reported in Florida and Texas, following the release of GE Mosquitoes there. 
 
THE GENETICALLY ENGINEERED MOSQUITOES PRODUCED 
ARE AN EXPERIMENT. 
 
The Gene Editing process is not accurate as many traits are fired at the DNA and 
then mutations happen as the DNA tries to repair itself. The new traits promised in 
the mosquitoes are that only males will be released, no biting females. 
 
Also genes deform females reproductive organs and mouths, so that the mosquitoes 
will die off. In every other release, the mosquito populations have not died off and so 
those traits are spreading through reproduction and to other species that feed on 
Mosquitoes, such as birds and fish and through gene transfer into the water and soil.  
 
The Genetically Engineered mosquito eggs will become larvae and spend two more 
weeks feeding in water before hatching. Some will die, some will be eaten, and the 
contamination of water is inevitable.  Male mosquitoes who were produced without 
the trait of attraction to females, developed a taste for human blood and became 
biters and transmitters of disease. The Horizontal Gene Transfer Traits that deform 
females will enter the food and water systems of Bali and interact with our bodies.      

THE WOLBACHIA BACTERIA THAT THE MOSQUITOES HAVE BEEN EXPOSED 
TO IS ALSO GENETICALLY ENGINEERED. 
 
Natural strains of Wolbachia are present in most insects. It is being used as some 
studies have shown that it blocks mosquitoes from carrying Dengue. It is impossible 
to predict the side effects, behavior and spread of a genetically engineered Wolbachia, 
to beneficial insects including pollinators and the whole microbiome. The mosquito 
eggs would have to be placed in a body of water. Water is understood to be an equal 
disease vector as mosquitoes are, and studies have linked Wolbachia to cases of river 
blindness and elephantiasis in humans.  
 
THERE IS AN UNACCEPTABLE LEVEL OF RISK THAT THE THREE DISTINCT 
GENETICALLY ENGINEERED COMPONENTS OUTLINED ABOVE: 
 
A GENETICALLY-ALTERED HYBRID MOSQUITO HOSTING A GENETICALLY 
ENGINEERED BACTERIA AND CAPABLE OF CARRYING PATENTED DISEASES 
COULD DESTROY THE WATER AND ENVIRONMENT OF BALI, AND THE 
HEALTH OF THE POPULATION. 
 
THE THREAT OF A MASSIVE MOSQUITO RELEASE WOULD DETER VISITORS 
AND COULD CREATE AN ECONOMIC COLLAPSE. 
 
SAFETY TESTING IS IMPOSSIBLE AS PATENTS MEAN THAT INDEPENDENT 
RISK ASSESSMENT AND STUDIES ARE NOT REQUIRED OR EVEN ALLOWED. 
 
Companies do not have to disclose their ingredients. Both pharmaceutical and military 
operations are not obliged to share even the location of their field trials. There has 
been neither consultation, consent or referendum  
 
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT TESTS AND ALL REGULATIONS TREAT NEW 
PRODUCTS LIKE CHEMICALS WHICH CAN BE CONTAINED AND POSSIBLY 
CLEANED UP VERY DIFFERENTLY. GENETICALLY MODIFIED ORGANISMS 
AND GENE-EDITED ORGANISMS ARE LIVING. 
 
They can spread in multiple transmissible ways, as is well known since the spread of 
the Coronavirus and its Variants worldwide. The only way to prevent the damage done 
by this release is to stop it and make sure it does not happen. 
 
 
 

GAIN OF FUNCTION EXPERIMENTS ARE FUNDED BECAUSE COMPANIES ARE 
ALLOWED TO RESEARCH DISEASES THAT COULD POTENTIALLY CAUSE A 
PANDEMIC SO THAT THEY CAN PREPARE A MEDICAL RESPONSE. 
 
They justify creating new dangerous pathogens by saying that the mutations could 
have happened in nature. The Dengue Variant which the mayor refers to for Bali, 
Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever is extremely rare and different from Dengue 1, 3, 4 at 
least.  
 
There are two possible explanations for this severe strain to be mentioned. Either the 
mosquitoes will introduce A Genetically Engineered Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever, A 
Gain Of Function product as there is a vaccine ready, developed by the same 
laboratories to combat such an outbreak or The Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever was 
mentioned to instill fear in the population. The fear of the severe symptoms of internal 
and external bleeding and how it particularly affects children would make the public 
more receptive to both The Genetically Engineered Mosquitoes as a deterrent and the 
acceptance of treatments once the symptoms start to appear.  
 
ONE WAY TO BLOCK THE RELEASE COULD BE TO USE THE TREATIES IN 
PLACE TO STOP THE PROLIFERATION OF WEAPONS OF MASS 
DESTRUCTION. 
 
Biological Weapons were the first to be identified as Weapons Of Mass Destruction 
over 50 years ago. The plan to release the mosquitoes is profitable to some stake 
holders and the vested interests in the manufacture of mosquitoes, the diseases and 
any medical response. This means that the Bali Authorities need to test all the several 
million eggs for traces of disease and somehow predict the Down-Stream Gene 
Transfers of The Genetically Modified Microorganisms and their interactions in every 
biological process. 
 
It may be important to note that scorching an area has been used as the only way to 
stop the spread of dangerous Genetically Engineered contaminations in the past. We 
should also ask the question whether this is relevant to the appearance of a deadly 
strain of bird flu concurrent with the release of Genetically Engineered Mosquitoes 
Maui, in March 2023.   
 
 
Frances circulated a paper for the Institute for Responsible Technology, in 2021

Points proven through published papers on https://protectnaturenow.com  
https://www.regulations.gov/commenton/EPA-HQ-OPP-2019-0274-0363 - 
Demonstration of how public consultation, objections and refusals are no longer 
facilitated, only ‘comments’. 
 
When GMOs enter the environment, they can reproduce and transfer genes that will 
be passed onto future generations. Regulations and risk assessments are 
completely inadequate to decide if it is safe to release GM mosquitoes in California. 
Previously, safety and environmental impact assessments of pest control products 
needed only to assess chemical impacts over a specified area. Assessing the 

introduction of novel living organisms with no existing natural niche must take into 
account their ability to spread. Oxitec nor the World Mosquito Program, nor 
regulators, nor funders, have produced environmental impact statements, 
endangered species assessments, or studies on human health impacts. 
 
Spread Via Sexual Reproduction 
Consider how a population can spread over a year, first of all through sexual 
reproduction. Normally the Aedes Aegypti live for two weeks, reproduce three times 
during that time, up to a 100 eggs each time (CDC, 2021). Oxitec claim to have 
inserted ‘self-limiting genes’, which ensure the females do not reach maturity, 
deforming their reproductive organs so they cannot breed. In some experiments the 
females were produced with deformed mouths so they could not bite (Muller, 2021).  
  
In addition, disruption of their sensing capacities was achieved (Basrur, 2020), by 
which they would have chosen suitable pooled water for laying their eggs. The 
applicant claims that they will breed less successfully and reduce disease-carrying 
populations of biting female mosquitos. Male mosquitos will survive to pass on the 
lethal gene (Servick, 2019). Finally, scientists added an illuminating transgene, which 
can be monitored at least while in the confines of the lab, to confirm that the inserted 
traits have passed onto offspring (Nolan, 2021).  
  
People in the trial areas have not provided their consent to being experimented on 
with OX5034. 
However, the most common occurrence in genetic engineering is unexpected side 
effects. For example, when male mosquitoes were produced in an experiment that 
eliminated their attraction to the scent of the female mosquitoes and their inclination 
to mate, the males developed an attraction instead to human blood, which previously 
only females expressed (Tracey, 2020). It is too difficult for risk assessments to 
anticipate a mutation like this and the multitude of other mutations and traits which 
might be transferred. Bacteria, for example, continually swap genes that help them 
adapt and survive.

The genetic engineering process itself routinely causes widespread damage to the 
genome including off-target mutations, additions and deletions (Latham, 2021). 
Oxitec claim that their genetic engineering process and GE mosquitos are “Precise: 
Our insects only target their own species. They will not harm other, beneficial insects 
– unlike some other methods of control”. The claim that genetic engineering is 
precise has been used by the biotech industry since the production of the first GMO 
crops and remains completely false. With unexpected and unwanted changes and 
damage caused by the process, many go unnoticed and it is impossible to predict 
further mutations downstream.  
Unfortunately, most scientists who use gene editing do not spend the time or money 
to evaluate whether their GMO has unanticipated changes in structure and function 
(Smith, 2021).  
 
In the Brazil field trials, Oxitec did not perform experiments to assess whether GM 
mosquitoes might persist in the wild (Powell, 2019). All governments, including the 
US, have little or no regulatory oversight for gene edited GMOs. They based this 

hands-off policy on the false belief that gene editing is safe, predictable and even of 
benefit to public health. As another research group pointed out, public education is 
not the same as public consultation (Powell, 2019). With such vast numbers of GE 
insects proposed to be released in densely populated areas, a public referendum 
should perhaps be called to ensure public awareness and involvement in the 
decision-making process. 
  
Genetically engineered microbes and viruses present the most immediate and 
widespread hazards. The transfer of new genes from GM organisms to wild non-GM 
mosquito populations and non-target species mean that the spread would be much 
wider, with high risk of negative consequences for human and environmental health 
(Kofler, 2019).  
  
There was an independent study conducted on DNA spread from the genetically 
modified mosquitoes released in Brazil. Novel DNA and up to 13% of the genome 
were found in 5%-60% of the mosquitos captured and tested (Servick 2019). This 
report clearly refutes the applicant’s claim that no more than 3% of the GE mosquitos 
will survive (Oxitec, 2021).  
  
Potential Human Health Impacts Have Not Been Researched by Any Third Party 
The applicant proposes that only males will be released. Is that possible to 
guarantee, at such numbers? During Oxitec’s Brazil release, 450,000 GE mosquitos 
were released every week for two years from 2013-2015 in Jacobina. 
 
Although there was evidence that the mosquito populations were majorly reduced 
(by between 90% and 96%), there was no evidence that there were fewer cases of 
dengue fever or Zika virus, both carried by the Aedes Aegypti mosquito. 
Furthermore, up until 2015, Zika was considered a benign disease, with no 
symptoms but the Zika epidemic that spread in Brazil in 2015 and 2016, registered 
over 200,000 cases of babies born with brain defects, from the infection (Lowe, 
2018). If there is any chance at all that genetically engineered mosquitoes could 
drive the development of a deadly variant of a previously harmless virus, another 
release should be deemed unacceptable. 
  
Powell (2019) and the Brazilian research team who discovered the persistent Oxitec 
DNA strains, raised the alarm that more safety studies should be done. Although 
they agreed that Oxitec’s two transgenes themselves had not been found in the 
future generations and there was no evidence that the mosquito population was fitter 
or more likely to transmit disease, Powell reiterated ‘”What is important is that 
something unanticipated happened. When people develop transgenic lines or 
something to release, almost all of their information comes from laboratory 
studies…Things do not always work out how you expect.” 
  
GMOs can become biological time bombs, hiding their unpredictable side effects 
until they have come into contact with certain species or conditions, or until their 
genetic constructs have mutated in future generations. The hope is that the male GE 
mosquitoes would mate with the native population of females and the lethal gene 
only be passed to female offspring.  
  
OX5034 GMO Mosquitoes Are Raised in Tetracycline and May Spread Antibiotic-

Resistant Bacteria, Such as Staph and MRSA 
These genetic alterations could end up in organisms and ecosystems that were 
never intended or considered. Oxitec claims the GM mosquitos are “Non-persistent: 
The self-limiting system means that our self-limiting gene cannot establish in the 
ecosystem.” Even their ‘self-limiting system’ presents an immediate human health 
threat. Oxitec describes how when they turn off the self-destruct mechanism, in order 
to let the mosquitos breed, they use an antibiotic Tetracycline (Oxitec, 2021). 
Tetracycline is used to treat a variety of bacterial infections. Using any antibiotic 
when it is not needed can cause it to not work for future infections. (WebMD, 2021) 
By 2050, it is estimated that 10 million people will die every year due to antibiotics 
having been rendered ineffective (Kennedy, 2021) from overuse.  
  
In addition, due to the widespread nature of gene transfer between species, it is 
nonsense for the applicant to propose that the GM mosquitos will not interact with 
other species and exchange genetic material, whether they are designed to target 
their own species exclusively or not. The only time to prevent the release of altered 
microbes associated with the GE mosquitos is now. They cannot be traced or 
recalled and it may not be possible to protect the microbiome on which our food and 
environment depend afterwards. 
  
Environmental Impacts Have Not Been Assessed, Including Impact On Endangered 
Species  
 
The applicant completely overlooks the nature of the mosquitos’ beneficial roles in 
the environment, including biomass transfer, their place in the food chain, and as 
pollinators.   
  
If a mosquito survives to adulthood, it flies away from its aquatic habitat, transferring 
the mosquito’s biomass, its material weight, to the terrestrial ecosystem. Mosquito 
biomass has been calculated at 96 million pounds in Alaska alone (Peach, 2019). 
Have the applicants considered the impact on waterways and sanitation, if vast 
quantities of GE mosquitos do not reach maturity, and remain festering in the pools 
where the eggs were laid? Water is an equal disease vector as mosquitos (Oryan, 
2020). Has an assessment been done on how the nutrient-cycling by mosquitoes to 
plant growth and other ecosystem functions will be replaced or maintained if the 
species are eradicated? As Peach (2019) comments, although these aspects remain 
unstudied the amount of biomass involved implies that it may be important. Of 550 
gigatons of biomass on the planet, insects make up 1% whereas humans make up 
only 0.06% (Daly, 2018).  
 
GMO Mosquitos Will Not Reduce Pesticide Spraying 
The United Nations estimates that the productivity of 20 percent of the planet’s 
vegetated surface is declining (Giles, 2019). Genetically altered bacteria from 
degrading GE Mosquito biomass could be released into California’s already nearly 
inert soil microbiome and affect fertility. Insecticide-resistant insects are also 
associated with higher levels of insecticide use, causing nutrient, water and soil 
structure loss and erosion (Pocket, 2021). It is conceivable that the GE mosquitoes 
could cause an imbalance in biological properties, including soil enzymes, 
microorganisms and their activities. These altered microbes might migrate into the 
atmosphere, into the ocean, even within microbiomes of humans or animals.  

 
While Oxitec claims its GMO mosquitoes are necessary to fight dengue fever, there’s 
no proof that they can actually eradicate the disease 
Several studies suggest that the GE Mosquitos will not do what they are purported to 
do. The mosquitos have been developed on the belief that it is the adult biting female 
mosquitoes that transmit disease. In fact it was found out that mosquitoes were the 
cause of an outbreak of Ockelbo disease in Sweden in 2013.  A study published in 
Vector-Borne and Zoonotic Diseases (2016), established that the related Sindbis 
virus could be found in mosquito larvae in spring, the year after the 2013 outbreak. 
The researchers concluded that the virus is transferred from the female mosquito to 
her eggs. "The mosquitoes are infected with the virus already at birth, which has not 
previously been shown," (Evander, 2016).  
The larvae live in water for up to two weeks. In this time, they feed constantly. They 
primarily use brushes near their mouths to filter through the water where they are 
living and eat microorganisms like bacteria, fungi, algae and plankton. However, 
some kinds of mosquito larvae even eat the larvae of other mosquitoes (Jenkins-
Green, 2021) 
 
Risk assessment is beyond current predictive capacity.  
Once it is understood that disease pathogens are already present in the mosquito 
larvae, it makes it unacceptably dangerous to introduce GE mosquitoes designed to 
perpetuate a gene that is lethal to females. Altered microorganisms would inevitably 
pass through horizontal gene transfer to other aquatic species, to migratory birds 
and be carried in the water itself into the fresh water and food supply.  
Mosquito larvae are eaten by many creatures including birds, bats, frogs and other 
insects. Adult mosquitoes that die (or are eaten and excreted) then decompose, 
turning the microbes they consumed as larvae into nutrients for plants, completing 
another important ecological function (Evander, 2016). Mosquito larvae grow by 
consuming microorganisms such as algae and microbes that decompose decaying 
plant material (Peach, 2019). 
GE Mosquito Pollinators - will they participate and do the job and could they do 
harm? 
Genetic evidence supports a rapid increase in mosquito diversity corresponding with 
the appearance of flowering plants. Mosquito scales have been found in flower 
fossils from 145.5 to 66 million years ago. Mosquitoes serve as prolific pollinators 
interacting with many different plants (Peach, 2019). Mosquito-mediated pollination 
can be broken into three stages all of which involve microbial interaction. Will plants 
attract GE mosquitos to their flowers at the pre-pollination stage to collect pollen? 
GE organisms have been shown to exert different selection pressures on their 
microbiome and related functions (Krishnan, 2021). Will the GE insects fulfil the 
second stage leading to pollen receipt and dispersal. In the post-pollination stage, 
the pollen germinates on the stigma, grows down the style, releasing sperm nuclei 
that fertilize the eggs within the ovules that ultimately become seeds (Cullen, 2020). 
Has gene transfer been assessed from the GE mosquito saliva to pollen and into the 
sexual organs of plants with which they interact during pollination (Peach, 2019)? 
Oxitec claims biting females will not be released. A peer-reviewed study proved them 
wrong. 
 
The claims of “sustainability” made by Oxitec (2021) also ignore the mosquitos’ own 
extensive microbiota. Bacteria colonize different mosquito organs, including gut, 

salivary glands, ovaries and male accessory glands (Huang, 2020). Questioning an 
earlier application the applicants were informally asked if the saliva of the GE 
mosquitoes had been tested for presence of pathogen variants or other altered 
genetic material and they’re possible interaction with the human population, and 
saliva had not been tested (Smith, 2013). Although the Lyme disease bacteria have 
been found in the salivary glands of mosquitoes, there is no evidence that 
mosquitoes are capable of passing them on in a very short bite, in the number and 
state required for an infection. This might reassure regulators but actually the other 
epidemic in Sweden, caused by Sindbus virus demonstrated a huge under diagnosis 
of cases as the symptoms are synonymous with arthritis and can begin as quite mild 
(Evander, 2016). 
   
Mosquito larvae grow by consuming microorganisms such as algae and microbes 
that decompose decaying plant material. Larval mosquitoes contribute to aquatic 
food chains by serving as food sources for many predators, including fish and birds 
(Peach, 2019). In addition to the disaster if the lethal transgene transferred to other 
pollinators, aquatic insects, fish and birds, disabling crucial reproductive functions, it 
could also feasibly enter the human microbiome. Even small alterations to the 
microbiome can have profound consequences, including disease or death of an 
organism, and disruption or collapse of ecosystems.  
  
Alternatives – Cleaning up areas that are worst affected via better sanitation and 
using the native mosquitoes’ own microbiota.  
Increasing interest has been shown in employing symbiotic bacteria to control 
mosquito-borne diseases. Mosquito salivary gland, ovaries and hemolymph are also 
important for virus or parasite replication and transmission. Many studies believe that 
the only appropriate and effective way to address the spread of disease amongst the 
human population is to address the issues of poverty and access to clean water and 
sanitary systems (Lewis, 2021). 
There has been no transparency surrounding the experimental release. Where? 
When? How many? What are they trying to hide? 
 The proposed amendment would extend field testing in Florida by another 24 
months on up to 6,240 acres and expand testing to California on up 84,600 acres. 
This specific acreage suggests that the applicants have a way to contain the GE 
mosquitos in this designated test area. The problem of containment is only 
unsatisfactorily addressed in the highest security laboratories (Nolan, 2021). 
Hundreds of accidents in high security laboratories that work with microbes and 
viruses underscore the serious risk of creating these, even for contained research 
purposes. 1.4. Facilities that create or utilize GE microbes in production and 
research often lack the precautions and disposal methods to prevent environmental 
release. Too little attention is paid to potentially harmful impacts that these 
organisms may have on various ecosystems, including the human microbiome. 
Through contamination of waterways, pollen and gene transfer to other species 
through the food chain and decaying mosquito biomass, there are infinite pathways 
for altered microbes to spread beyond the test area and the GE mosquitoes’ own 
reach.  
 
Similar experiments in Brazil and Cayman Islands have been a failure.  
  
Access to gene editing technology already opens the floodgates for companies to 

manufacture hundreds and thousands of different gene sequences every day. These 
are tested for successes rather than errors or failures. The resulting GE products are 
therefore by no means ready for approval or release in the open environment and it 
would be irresponsible to do so. 
  
It might have taken the pandemic for people to realize how microbes and viruses 
rapidly cross borders and encircle the globe. It is widely understood now how 
microbes can interact with the microbiome of vastly different ecosystems and 
organisms. Risk and safety assessments of the GE mosquitoes’ microbiota and their 
interaction with the environment are too extensive to fathom. Microbes are found 
everywhere on earth, in the atmosphere, in the soil, in water, in all genetically 
engineered and native organisms and in us.  
  
Based on more than 50,000 published studies, we now understand that the majority 
of chronic illnesses in humans can be traced to some sort of ecological dysfunction 
(Smith, 2020).  The health of insects and plants are also supported by their 
microbiomes. Humans, for example, have about 22,000 functional genes in our 
chromosomes. The Aedes Aegypti mosquito has just under 15,500 (Wortman, 2007). 
But according to some experts, we more than make up for it because we are really 
an ecosystem for microbes. Our bodies contain over three and a half million 
microbial genes. They dictate the vast majority of the metabolic functions within our 
body.  
   
It is urgent that we implement responsible laws and policies to prevent the release of 
any more GE organisms and their microbial communities; implement appropriate 
safeguards at all facilities using or creating GE microbes, assign strict liability costs 
should any human or environmental health crisis occur, as a result of insufficient 
safety testing of the applicant’s products and releases to date. 
  
These problems of unexpected damage to the mosquito genome, unwanted 
mutations and the proliferation of changed microbes establishing in the environment 
via horizontal gene transfer are confirmed in peer-reviewed studies. They are still 
being ignored or denied by many GMO proponents and lobbyists. The massive 
introduction of GMOs in this generation could permanently replace nature. We could 
lose biological evolution as we know it, disrupting the crucial functions of building 
organic matter and pollination in growing food and accessibility of clean water.

Introduction 
  
Rapid developments in genetic engineering have recently created unique 
challenges: Infant technologies are being used in multiple settings to modify and 
generate microorganisms, aiming to promote particular traits. The accidental release 
of a novel species or pathogen could have far reaching environmental, health, social, 
and economic consequences but there is also the risk of the intentional misuse of 
biological agents. National and international security risks have significantly 
expanded due to the accessibility of technology with the capacity to create new 
biological weapons. These weapons are designed for a new type of warfare and 
conflict, as they can be deployed covertly. Nonetheless, bioweapons are potentially 
more deadly than nuclear weapons and are internationally recognized as a weapon 
of mass destruction.  
  
The military point to their usefulness first: 
“The purely financial advantage of employing biological weapons was clearly 
illustrated by a 1969 expert United Nations panel which estimated the cost of 
operations against civilian populations at $1/Km2 for biological weapons, versus 
$600/Km2 for chemical, $800/Km(2)2 for nuclear, and $2,000/Km2 for conventional 
armaments” FAS, 2021 
There are many different ways genetic engineering can create potentially dangerous 
bioweapons: 
-       impart antibiotic resistance to bacterial pathogens 

-       increase human-to-human transmission of a deadly pathogen 
-   make an existing pathogen resistant to existing vaccines, therapeutics, or other 
countermeasures. 
However, there are also some important conditions an effective biological weapon 
has to meet: 
-    Procurement: one has to be able to procure a suitable biological agent. “The 
NATO definition of a biological agent is: A microorganism (or a toxin derived from it) 
which causes disease in man, plants or animals or which causes the deterioration of 
material.” They include Bacteria, Viruses, Rickettsiae, Chlamydia, Parasites, Fungi 
and Toxins. 
-      Mass production: a bioweapon needs to be produced at scale without the loss of 
pathogenicity,  Making microorganisms effective as self-propagating. 
-       Effective delivery: a biological agent typically needs to be deployed quickly and 
en masse to achieve its maximum impact before effective countermeasures can be 
deployed. 
-   Environmentally robust: a biological agent needs to be able to survive in the 
environment and spread. 
-    Treatable: the agent that releases a biological agent needs to have an effective 
countermeasure to prevent incurring damage from the biological agent.  
In “Guidance Notes to the Field Commander on the Consequences of Individual 
Agents For Continued Operational Effectiveness”, they include over 40 examples of 
biological agents, for example, Epidemic Typhus and Pneumonic Plague. 
(https://fas.org/nuke/guide/usa/doctrine/dod/fm8-9/2appc.htm). 
  
Most naturally occurring pathogens do not fulfill all of these conditions, making them 
unsuitable for use as a bioweapon, where genetically engineered pathogens with 
enhanced functions could.   
Recent times have seen the rise of non-national agents that might not consider the 
last condition (that treatment is available) to be necessary, as they would tolerate 
inflicting damage to their population if that meant inflicting much greater damage to 
their intended targets. This of course goes for our hostile use of biological weapons 
on other countries as well.  
Dissemination includes inhalation, dermal exposure and ingestion. Therefore 
contamination of the food supply has been described as the weaponization of 
agriculture. (https://apnews.com/article/genetics-science-biological-weapons-ap-top-
news-us-news-8ed74d87df524ab580d7fbd3b845d0c6) 
Meeting these conditions has been the main historical limiting factor in the 
development and proliferation of biological weapons: Very few countries were able to 
develop biological agents and the means to effectively deploy them. In addition, 
some deadly pathogens, like smallpox, exist only in high-security laboratories, and 
most potentially malicious actors would find it difficult or impossible to procure them.  
New gene editing techniques developed in the biotechnology industry provide an 
opportunity for malicious actors to procure and manufacture bioweapons: It is now 
possible to synthesize a pathogen from a digital genetic code from an online 
database. Genetic engineering processes no longer require highly trained and 
experienced staff and specialized equipment. This has significantly expanded the 
scope of malicious actors who could feasibly obtain and manufacture diseases which 
were contained or eradicated decades ago. In response, there have been consistent 
calls from the scientific community and the broader public to develop more effective 
methods of detection and prevention (Fraser, 2001). 

  
Biotechnology of Bioweapons 
  
The advances in the field of biotechnology have made genetic engineering much 
more accessible than ever before. The past several decades have seen the 
development of increasingly sophisticated means of editing a genome: First, there 
were molecular techniques like meganuclease, transcription activator-like effector 
nucleases (TALENs), and zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs), then small RNAs 
techniques, including microRNA (miRNA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA) 
followed, and finally, CRISPR/Cas9 has recently become the most dominant and 
most reliable genome editing technique (Khan, 2019). 
“At the moment, most gene editing involves "Crispr" – a set of genetic scissors first 
developed by the Nobel-prize winning scientists Emmanuelle Charpentier and 
Jennifer A Doudna in 2012. The technology relies on a kind of ancient immune 
system found in a large number of bacteria. When they encounter a potential viral 
threat, they copy and paste some of its DNA into their own genome, then use it to 
develop a pair of scissors that can identify that exact sequence. If they ever meet it 
again, they simply snip, and deactivate it.” (Gorvett, Z. 2021)  
Later Gorvett disputes CRISPR’s reliability and ability to deactivate an exact 
sequence, referencing studies claiming more than 50% of genetic engineering 
experiments observed unexpected and unwanted mutations. 
Figure 1. Overview of genome editing techniques (Khan, 2019) 
Over the past few decades, gene editing technologies have not only grown 
significantly in variety and availability (Figure 1), they have become much more 
accessible. CRISPR technology, in particular, has reduced the cost of the gene 
editing process. For $990-1990, one can acquire a complete CRISPR gene editing 
kit online capable of performing gene knockouts, point mutations, and gene knock-
ins. This has made gene editing technology widely available to people with little or no 
knowledge of genetics (Scientific American, 2017). In 2017, German authorities in 
Bavaria found that two DIY CRISPR bacteria kits contained potentially pathogenic 
bacteria. Although the risks of creating a dangerous pathogen using these DIY kits 
are considered to be relatively small, the wide availability of these kits, complete lack 
of regulation and oversight, and their potential widespread use certainly raise 
national security questions. Although these kits alone would not be sufficient to 
create a homemade bioweapon, they most likely make this enterprise easier for a 
potential malicious agent with sufficient knowledge. Most importantly, they are 
currently not regulated nor their sale monitored by the relevant agencies. 
  
Dual Use Research 
  
Dual-use items are goods, software and technology that can be used for both civilian 
and military applications” (EU Dual Use Trade Controls: 
https://ec.europa.eu/trade/import-and-export-rules/export-from-eu/dual-use-controls/) 
The 1925 Geneva Protocol (or the Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of 
Asphyxiating, Poisonous or other Gases, and Bacteriological Methods of Warfare) 
and the 1972 Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention legally limited the 
development, production, acquisition, transfer, stockpiling and use of biological 
weapons. However, the absence of meaningful mechanisms for ensuring that 
countries comply with their obligations remains a major weakness. 
(https://www.amacad.org/publication/governance-dual-use-technologies-theory-and-

practice/section/5) . The Geneva Protocol banned the use, but not development or 
production of biological weapons, while the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention 
specifically prohibited their development, production, and proliferation. This 
established a strong global norm on biological weapons, which effectively 
established a worldwide ban. This was further augmented by the 1993 Chemical 
Weapons Convention (or the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, 
Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction), 
which planned but failed to introduce extensive verification measures, like on-site 
inspections.  
Therefore, when the Chemical Weapons Convention became effective in 1997, a 
global ban on biological weapons came into effect. This meant that no country, 
including the US, was allowed to develop biological weapons. However, this applies 
to any research with a specific goal to develop a bioweapon. It does not apply to 
research where bioweapon development can occur as a side-product. There is 
research that produces results that can be applied to weaponizing biological agents, 
and where the research produces organisms that can be utilized as bioweapons. 
The results of this research can, therefore, have multiple uses, one of which is a 
bioweapon.This is how dual use research is so far not illegal.  
However, two phrases are inextricably linked to bioweapons research: “dual use 
research of concern” (DURC) and “gain of function.”  
The National Institutes of Health define DURC as:  
“Dual Use Research of Concern (DURC) is life sciences research that, based on 
current understanding, can be reasonably anticipated to provide knowledge, 
information, products, or technologies that could be directly misapplied to pose a 
significant threat with broad potential consequences to public health and safety, 
agricultural crops and other plants, animals, the environment, material, or national 
security.” (NIH, 2021a) 
Therefore, DURC includes not just human pathogens, but also some plant and 
animal pathogens, because these could, if released accidentally or intentionally, 
cause significant economic and environmental damage. The following criteria are 
used to evaluate whether research can be classified as DURC: 
“Can the research be reasonably anticipated to produce one or more of the seven 
experimental effects/categories listed below? 
Will an intermediate or final product of your research make a vaccine less effective 
or ineffective? YES / NO 
Will the final or intermediate product of your research confer resistance to antibiotics 
or antivirals in ways that are inherently different from those published previously? 
YES / NO 
Will your work enhance the virulence of a pathogen or render a non-pathogen 
virulent? YES / NO 
Will the results of your work increase the transmissibility of any pathogen? YES / NO 
Will your research result in alteration of the host range of a pathogen? YES / NO 
Will your research result in a product or intermediary that may prevent or interfere 
with diagnosis of infection or disease? YES / NO 
Does your research enable “weaponization” of an agent or toxin? YES / NO 
Even though your research did not involve any of the aforementioned seven criteria, 
and recognizing that your work product or results of your research could conceivably 
be misused, is there the potential for your results/product to be readily utilized to 
cause public harm? YES / NO” (NIH, 2021b)  
If the answer to any of these questions is YES or potentially YES, then the research 

could potentially be DURC and is reviewed and assessed by the Institutional 
Biosafety Committee (IBC) to determine whether the criteria for DURC is met. If 
research is classified as DURC, any publication of its results has to be authorized by 
the NIH Deputy Director for Intramural Research's Dual Use Committee, to make 
sure that sensitive or dangerous information is not released into the public sphere. 
However, communication of research results and sharing the benefits to society are 
required both to a) justify conducting dual use research at all and b) provide 
information to do a meaningful risk assessment. Prohibiting the publication of results 
also protects organizations and laboratories from scrutiny by regulators, in regard to 
biosafety and national security during export, transfer, brokering and transit of dual 
use items. (https://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2020/january/tradoc_158576.pdf) 
  
“The Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) was the first international treaty 
outlawing an entire class of weapons of mass destruction. From the outset, the 
BWC’s terms acknowledged the dual-use nature of biological agents: instead of 
prohibiting biological weapons specifically, it committed parties never to “...acquire or 
retain: microbial or other biological agents, or toxins . . . of types and in quantities 
that have no justification for prophylactic, protective or other peaceful purposes,” as 
well as “weapons, equipment or means of delivery designed to use such agents or 
toxins for hostile purposes.”5 This language also ensured that the BWC’s 
fundamental prohibitions would apply to all future scientific and technological 
developments in the life sciences and related fields, including in the nascent field of 
biotechnology. 
  
At the same time, the convention commits its parties to facilitate the fullest possible 
exchange of materials, equipment, and information for using biological agents and 
toxins for peaceful purposes and to avoid hampering international cooperation in 
such activities. This tension between the nonproliferation and assistance provisions 
of the BWC has been a major source of controversy between developed and 
developing countries since the earliest days of the convention.

Gain of Function Research 
  
Gain of function (GOF) research is a type of research where natural mutation 
processes of viruses and bacteria are accelerated in a laboratory to impart enhanced 
traits to these organisms. The objective is to create pathogens with increased 
human-to-human transmission, virulence, antigenicity, or antibiotic resistance. This 
research is done to identify specific mutations that lead to these traits, so they can 
be monitored in the wild pathogen population, or used to develop countermeasures. 
It is easy to see how developing pathogens that have more dangerous traits than 
their naturally occurring counterparts is highly dangerous and can be considered 
bioweapon research. 
In addition to accelerating natural mutations in a laboratory, there have been several 
relatively recent cases of engineered pathogens that would be much more 
dangerous than their naturally occurring counterparts. In 1997, anthrax bacterium 
(Bacillus antracis) was modified by an introduction of an alien gene, making it 
resistant to existing vaccines. In 2012, two studies reported genetically modifying 
H5N1 avian flu virus (Morens, 2012; Nature, 2013), a flu variant with extremely high 
mortality rates (WHO, 2020). The new strain was reported to be transmitted through 

the air in ferrets, which are a common animal model intended to approximate 
transmission in humans. To obtain the common H5N1 avian flu virus, it was 
necessary to spend extended periods of time with infected birds. The publication of 
five mutations engineered to enhance transmissibility could serve a hostile agent 
planning to create and release a pathogen with pandemic potential. 
In 2014, another flu variant, H7N1, was modified to allow respiratory transmission in 
ferrets (Dermody, 2014a). The decision by the Journal of Virology to publish this 
research has sparked a debate (Wain-Hobson, 2014; Dermody, 2014b) prompting 
the American Society for Microbiology Journals to publish details of its DURC review 
process (Casadevall, 2015).  
Gain of function research is not limited to human pathogens: In 2011, a study was 
published on modified entomopathogenic fungi M. anisopliae with engineered 
dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN) melanin biosynthetic genes (Tsang, 2011). This 
created a strain with enhanced anti-stress capacity and virulence, making the fungi 
both a more effective killer of the diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) larvae, and 
more resistant to UV-B light and extreme temperature, improving its survivability. 
This is just one of many instances of genetic modification of plant or animal 
pathogens to increase their resistance and enhance their virulence (Butler, 1998; 
Jacobson, 2000; Liu, 2002; Wilson, 2009). 
Because of the clear bioweapon potential of GOF research on ‘select agents’ 
(pathogens identified as a major risk to public health), a moratorium should be 
sought. Furthermore, GOF  results are almost certainly prohibited from circulation, 
diminishing the value of undertaking the research. 
  
Biological Toxins and Gene Editing 
  
Gene editing an organism to produce and deliver a biological toxin is another way to 
engineer a bioweapon. Although biological toxins are chemical molecules, they are 
commonly produced by plants, animals, and microorganisms like bacteria, fungi, or 
algae. Therefore, gene editing of these organisms is considered to be one of the 
ways to create a bioweapon. In particular, there are many organisms that produce 
neurotoxins – biological toxins that target the nervous system. There are a number of 
paralytic neurotoxins produced in living organisms like bacteria and algae (Giordano 
2011; Giordano, 2017).  
Gene editing can be used to obtain  
 
• 
genetically modified organisms that have enhanced abilities for the 
production of biological toxins,  
 
• 
increased stability and resilience to environmental conditions, or even 
 
• 
 given the ability to produce a biological toxin where none previously 
existed.  
The developments in genetic engineering technology, the digitization of genetic 
information obtained through scientific research, and its wide proliferation online 
make it easier than ever to obtain the necessary information and conduct the 
experiment to create a bioweapon through genetic modification. With technological 
advances far out-pacing regulations, it is likely that this will become even easier to 
do in the future. 
  
In Vivo Genetic Modification 
  
Current gene editing technology has its limitations: While it is easy to conduct gene 

editing in cells and tissues in vitro (lat. in glass; meaning in a glass dish), it is 
significantly harder to alter a genome in a living organism – in vivo, especially 
complex organisms like mammals. There are several challenges current technology 
faces when it comes to in vivo genetic modification. 
CRISPR and other gene editing technologies use molecules as editing tools. In order 
to conduct genetic modification in vivo, these gene editing molecules must be 
injected into the organism (for humans, this would be either into the muscle tissue or 
blood). Once inside, the gene editing molecules would have to be viable inside the 
body and be able to cross cellular membranes to get to the cell DNA. In addition, for 
genetic modification of the nervous system and the brain, these molecules would 
have to be able to cross the blood-brain barrier.  
All of these conditions make viruses the most likely delivery system for in vivo 
genetic modification. Customized genetic viral vectors, with adeno-associated 
viruses (AAV)) have been successfully created for non-invasive gene transfer in 
mice (Deverman, 2016; Chan, 2017).  “In the adult mouse, intravenous 
administration of 1 × 1011 vector genomes (vg) of AAV-PHP.eB transduced 69% of 
cortical and 55% of striatal neurons, while 1 × 1012 vg of AAV-PHP.S transduced 
82% of dorsal root ganglion neurons, as well as cardiac and enteric neurons.” (Chan, 
2017). 
“However, this method (viral gene transfer) presents several side effects such as 
generation of novel infectious agents, immunogenicity of the vector and mutational 
insertion of viral DNA” ( Pasquet et al, 2018)  
The AAV technology is currently being widely used to develop gene therapies for a 
number of conditions, including coagulation disorders, inherited blindness, and 
neurodegenerative diseases (Colella, 2018; Wang, 2019). On 13 November 2018, 
there were 145 interventional clinical trials involving rAAV registered at 
ClinicalTrials.gov (Wang, 2019). 
“AAV belongs to the genus Dependoparvovirus within the family Parvoviridae. Its life 
cycle is dependent on the presence of a helper virus, such as AdV (adenovirus), 
hence its name and taxonomy classification. AAV is found in multiple vertebrate 
species, including human and non-human primates (NHPs). The current consensus 
is that AAV does not cause any human diseases. It is composed of an icosahedral 
protein capsid of ~26 nm in diameter and a single-stranded DNA genome of ~4.7 kb.” 
(Wang, 2019) 
AAVs are modified to replace their protein-coding genetic sequences with 
therapeutic gene expression cassettes, contributing to their low immunogenicity and 
cytotoxicity when delivered in vivo. Its single-stranded DNA is first converted to 
double-stranded DNA, by combining AAVs containing each of the halves of the 
double strand, which are then annealed by Watson–Crick base pairing in the 
nucleus. Another approach is to design the AAV to generate a self-complementary 
genome configuration, removing the need for two AAVs, but also halving the 
packaging capacity of the genetic cassette. 
There are several different gene therapy strategies: gene replacement, gene 
silencing, gene addition, and gene editing (Wang, 2019). Gene therapy in adult 
animals targets a specific tissue, like the liver, eye, or muscle. Sometimes, 
transduced tissue can be used to produce therapeutic proteins for the treatment of 
disease in another tissue – for instance, transduced muscle tissue can be used to 
treat non-muscle disorders. Non-invasive gene transfer into cells or tissue by 
application of electric pulses, is also being tested. This could present risk of misuse 
in terms of remote gene transfer. 

Any of these strategies can conceivably be employed to create a bioweapon: –  
 
• 
Transduced tissue can be coded to produce toxic proteins instead of 
therapeutic ones; 
 
• 
 Genetically modified neurons can be coded to lose cognitive function., 
while  
 
• 
Liver and pancreas cells can be coded to alter their function and cause 
disease.  
There are many more possibilities for a human’s genome to be attacked to cause 
disease or death, and new technologies are exploring many of these avenues, albeit 
in a quest to cure or prevent disease. The knowledge necessary to achieve clinical 
success is not there yet: Even the majority of natural  microorganisms and their 
functions have not been studied yet.  
Regardless of risk, there has been rapid development in this consequential research 
and it is important that the risks are identified in advance.   
  
Synthetic Biology: Bioweapons Application 
  
Synthetic biology has massive potential for exploitation in the development of 
bioweapons. It is used widely in the production of pathogens and corresponding 
vaccines. 
The medical advances of the past century, vaccines in particular, have contained 
and almost eradicated some of the worst diseases known to man. Therefore, such 
pathogens cannot be found in nature, making it extremely difficult, in the past, for a 
malicious agent to obtain a sample of the pathogen to develop into a bioweapon.  
Now, though, synthetic biology and biotechnology allow for the re-creation of many 
dangerous pathogens without the need to obtain a live sample. All that is needed is 
the genetic code of the pathogens in digital form, which typically can be found in 
databases online. 
In 2002, the first case of a synthesized pathogen was published for a poliovirus 
(Cello, 2002). The researchers used the digital genetic sequence of the virus, 
ordered small customized DNA sequences, and combined them to reconstruct the 
complete viral genome. Finally, they created a live virus by adding a set of chemical 
agents, and the virus started to  reproduce. Poliovirus has a relatively small and 
simple genome, with around 7500 nucleotides (7.5 kb). The synthesized pathogen 
would constitute an ineffective bioweapon because;  
 
• 
most of the world’s population is vaccinated,  
 
• 
the disease develops in around 0.5% of cases, and  
 
• 
it spreads through infected fecal matter or saliva.  
According to WHO, there were 147 cases of polio globally in 2018, and 539 in 2019, 
down from around 350,000 in 1988. All of the cases of wild polio were recorded in 
Afghanistan and Pakistan, showing how the disease has been contained in the rest 
of the world. Although the poliovirus would not be effective as a bioweapon, this 
experiment shows how an artificial virus can be synthesized relatively easily in a lab 
with just a digital viral genome. It was only a matter of time before a more dangerous 
pathogen would be synthesized. 
This occurred in 2017, when a group of Canadian scientists, as part of an effort to 
create a safer smallpox vaccine, synthesized the horsepox virus. Using around 
$100,000 worth of chemicals, equipment and staff who were largely untrained in 
genetic engineering or synthetic biology, they applied the same method to recreate 
the related variola virus that causes smallpox (Noyce, 2018a). The close relation of 

the horsepox virus to the variola virus suggested that the same method could be 
applied to recreate the variola virus. Back in 2003, a national security report had 
already warned about just this eventuality when considering the national security 
implications of synthesizing the poliovirus (Van Aken, 2003): 
“However, the method for creating polio virus artificially cannot be directly transferred 
to the smallpox virus. The variola genome, with more than 200,000 base pairs, is far 
bigger than that of polio, and even if it were possible to recreate the full smallpox 
sequence in vitro, it could not easily be transformed into a live infectious virus 
particle. But there might be other ways. It would, for example, be possible to start 
with a closely related virus, such as monkeypox or mousepox, and to alter 
specifically those bases and sequences that differ from human smallpox.” 
In assessing the risk of Smallpox being used as a bioweapon, consider that it  
 
• 
Has been eradicated as a disease,  
 
• 
There have been no reports of the wild virus,  
 
• 
The last vaccinations occurred in 1980.  
 
• 
That means most of the world's population is not vaccinated against 
smallpox,  
 
• 
There are no large vaccine stocks at hand to conduct vaccination in 
case of an outbreak, a  
 
• 
The disease has a mortality rate of around 20% in adults and 80% in 
children under the age of 5.  
 
• 
The live virus exists only in two high-security labs in the US and 
Russia, posing minimal risk from accidental release, although there have been 
biosafety breaches in high security laboratories in recent years. Also Russia is one of 
five countries who maintain a complete bioweapons program, even having signed 
the BWC treaty.  
“At its peak, the Soviet program involved some 65,000 scientists, technicians, and 
other workers hidden in dozens of facilities operated by the KGB, the Soviet 
Academy of Sciences, the Soviet Academy of Medical Sciences, and the Ministries 
of Defense, Agriculture, Health, and Chemical Industry. Much of this illegal biological 
weapons program was hidden in plain sight in facilities conducting research and 
development (R&D) for pharmaceutical, industrial, and other civilian purposes. 
Recent research projects indicate that the technological obstacles to the creation of 
an artificial variola virus are relatively small. Any number of national and non-national 
actors could successfully do it, giving them access to a live, infectious virus from the 
smallpox family.  
Whether it is intended for use as a bioweapon or not, the risk of accidental release or 
theft of the virus for a biological attack becomes significantly greater as the number 
of locations containing the live virus increases. 
This has prompted a considerable debate about the risk evaluation of a potential 
smallpox epidemic (DiEuliis, 2017; Koblenz, 2017; Noyce, 2018b; MacIntyre, 2020). 
Prof. Koblenz of George Mason University wrote: 
“The synthesis of horsepox virus takes the world one step closer to the reemergence 
of smallpox as a threat to global health security. That threat has been held at bay for 
the past 40 years by the extreme difficulty of obtaining variola virus and the 
availability of effective medical countermeasures. The techniques demonstrated by 
the synthesis of horsepox have the potential to erase both of these barriers. The 
primary risk posed by this research is that it will open the door to the routine and 
widespread synthesis of other orthopoxviruses, such as vaccinia, for use in research, 
public health, and medicine. The normalization and globalization of orthopoxvirus 

synthesis for these beneficial applications will create a cadre of laboratories and 
scientists that will also have the capability and expertise to create infectious variola 
virus from synthetic DNA. Unless the safeguards against the synthesis of variola 
virus are strengthened, the capability to reintroduce smallpox into the human 
population will be globally distributed and either loosely or completely unregulated, 
providing the foundation for a disgruntled or radicalized scientist, sophisticated 
terrorist group, unscrupulous company, or rogue state to recreate one of humanity's 
most feared microbial enemies. The reemergence of smallpox—because of a 
laboratory accident or an intentional release—would be a global health disaster.” 
(Koblenz, 2017) 
In response to the criticism, the researchers who synthesized the horsepox virus 
made several points (Noyce, 2018b):  
 
• 
“All attempts to oppose technological advances have failed over 
centuries”, 
 
• 
 “One should instead focus on regulating the products of these 
technologies” 
 
• 
“Educate people of the need to plan mitigating strategies based upon a 
sound understanding of the risks.”  
The National Science Advisory Board for Biodefense (NSABB) eventually agreed 
that their oversight framework should be applied uniformly beyond the life sciences’ 
federally funded research, to synthetic biology, academia and the private sector. But 
not to classified biodefense analysis and countermeasures - which includes 
Research of  Concern. 
The creators of the horsepox also added that pathogens like the variola virus are 
already under strict regulatory control in many countries:  
“Possession of variola virus is a crime in Canada, and other countries have similar 
laws. Because there are DNA clone libraries, WHO recommends that no one should 
own >20% of the variola genome outside of the two authorized sites. Many countries 
follow these policies, and some legislate greater restrictions on the size of cloned 
variola sequences. Therefore, from a biosafety and biosecurity perspective, we 
already have some controls in place to manage the products of these technologies. 
Most of the regulatory recommendations are voluntary and follow vague criteria, 
rather than mandatory screening and enforcement. 
 
 
• 
Finally, they concluded that many technological advances that provided 
great benefit to humanity were initially seen as a threat, and that includes genetic 
engineering, adding: 
“As the memory of smallpox and polio fades, the challenge will be to educate new 
generations about the risk posed by these diseases. This necessitates providing the 
ongoing support that public health agencies will need to protect populations from 
even “extinct” epidemic diseases (emphasis added). The advance of technology 
means that no disease-causing organism can forever be eradicated.” 
This sort of rhetoric plays neatly into the hands of the pharmaceutical industry to 
justify continuing to recreate high risk deadly diseases and produce vaccines for 
them.  
The reality of technological developments that allow the synthesis of pathogens that 
have been eradicated poses a unique national security threat.. World governments 
are required to step up and agree that the risks of conducting this research are too 
high and implement either a ban or regulatory framework capable of enforcing 
existing legislation. We might otherwise be faced with an epidemic of a disease that 

has been long forgotten or a new synthetic strain.  
The other important issue is the risk evaluation and justification of such work: the 
main purpose of global vaccination programs is to eradicate diseases so the 
vaccination would no longer be necessary. The creation of artificial pathogens 
defeats that purpose completely, creating an endless need for vaccination against 
terrible diseases simply because there is a risk from a release of an artificial 
pathogen. One must wonder whether this research and the knowledge obtained are 
worth imposing this high cost on the entire world.  
Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering (MAGE) 
  
One of the main disadvantages of synthetic biology is the lack of genetic diversity of 
its products. Genomic diversity is the most important feature of natural organisms, 
allowing populations in nature to adapt to a variety of environments. This diversity is 
a byproduct of the long natural evolution and selection processes that occur in the 
wild. This is extremely difficult to reproduce in laboratory conditions, as the 
evolutionary processes occur over a relatively long time (Elena, 2003) - 3.7 billion 
years of continuous, undisturbed evolution by natural selection, to be exact . 
To address the lack of diversity, a method was developed - multiplex automated 
genome engineering (MAGE), which accelerated evolutionary processes in the lab 
(Wang, 2009): 
“…we describe multiplex automated genome engineering (MAGE) for large-scale 
programming and evolution of cells. MAGE simultaneously targets many locations on 
the chromosome for modification in a single cell or across a population of cells, thus 
producing combinatorial genomic diversity. Because the process is cyclical and 
scalable, we constructed prototype devices that automate the MAGE technology to 
facilitate the rapid and continuous generation of a diverse set of genetic changes 
(mismatches, insertions, deletions).” 
The researchers applied MAGE to optimize the 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate 
(DXP) biosynthesis pathway in Escherichia coli to overproduce lycopene (Wang, 
2009). They simultaneously modified 24 genetic components using a pool of 
synthetic DNA, creating 4.3 billion genomic variants per day. Within three days, they 
isolated variants with increased lycopene production. 
The MAGE method creates strain libraries for large-scale genotype–phenotype 
mapping (Si, 2017). The process of genetic engineering typically requires both the 
identification of genetic determinants and optimization of their expression in a 
concerted manner to improve target traits. Most of the methods perform these two 
tasks separately by “either modifying individual genes on a genome scale or creating 
combinatorial diversity among pre-defined targets” (Si, 2017). Automation of 
multiplex genome-scale modifications provides both, at the same time; genetic 
diversity and genome-wide screening and multiplex optimization to identify and 
isolate strains with improved traits.  
These recent advances – the development of MAGE method and its automation, 
provide the tools that allow rapid genome-scale engineering that can produce 
multiple simultaneous changes to the genome and then use accelerated evolution to 
screen for and isolate strains with desired traits. The rapid mutation and evolution 
process prevents the observation of, let alone study or biological correction of 
mutations, including those that are harmful or not beneficial.  
MAGE changes the paradigm of genetic engineering: Instead of sequential editing of 
genomic targets where the desired editing event typically occurs at a very low 
frequency, MAGE can perform simultaneous editing of multiple targets and screen 

an enormous number of strains for desired gene editing events (Bao, 2016).  
Some  of the national security implications from MAGE technology are: 
 
• 
Automated facilities are vulnerable to remote operation, release and 
theft. 
 
• 
CRISPR, including the integration of synthetic DNA into existing 
organisms are produced with no risk assessment and unspecified protocols on waste 
management..  
 
• 
The automated process allows the rapid creation and screening of 
billions of novel micro-organisms every day 
 
• 
No countermeasures or treatments exist.  
 
• 
Screening different strains to identify those which underwent desired 
gene editing events and isolate those with desired traits. Indeterminate methods to 
identify and manage those that didn’t 
 
• 
Operators of MAGE laboratories should be assigned liability and 
responsibility for biosafety.  
 
• 
Projects are not required to provide evidence of safety testing 
 
• 
Facilities do not have to produce an inventory to prove they are 
operating within the legal limit for storage, transfer and other Biosafety guidelines. 
 
• 
The automated process allows the rapid creation and screening of 
billions of novel microorganisms every day, sufficient to serve as a bioweapon. 
  
Conclusion 
  
Recent rapid advances in biotechnology have opened up new possibilities for 
bioweapons development. Biological weapons were the first weapons of mass 
destruction to be identified and made illegal worldwide. Unlike the use of nuclear 
weapons which is decided at a national level, anyone can launch a bioweapon.  
Gene editing technologies have made biological weapons accessible to private 
national and international interests. The weaponization of biological agents is now 
affordable and potentially profitable. The large scale creation of engineered 
microorganisms and virus vectors can easily produce pathogens that: 
Render a vaccine ineffective; 
Confer resistance to antibiotic or antiviral agents; 
Enhance the virulence of a pathogen or render a non-pathogen virulent; 
Increase the transmissibility of a pathogen; 
Alter the host range of a pathogen; 
Enable evasion of diagnosis or detection methods; and 
Enable weaponization of a biological agent or toxin. 
(Paquet, 2018) 
It is easier, more accessible and more affordable than ever before for small factions 
to engage in bioweapon development. The threshold of technical and scientific 
knowledge and capacity has been lowered significantly by the new technologies. 
This allows people with little to no specialized training to engage in genetic 
engineering. More importantly few scientists and none of the automated machines in 
MAGE facilities are screening for harmful mutations.  
When the online ‘Library’ of genetic sequences is described, it is not clear if there is 
a category for Potential Biological Weapon or Potential Pandemic Pathogen or 
Special Agent - which is another term for a biological agent that poses a pandemic 
risk to public health. 
In response to the serious national and global security implications, governments 

should urgently re-enter protocol negotiations on how to enforce the Biological 
Weapons Convention legislation. The current pandemic should provide additional 
leverage for regulatory bodies to demand more than voluntary reporting on biosafety, 
biosecurity, evidence of the benefits of the research and how the information can be 
safely shared.  
  
If proposed health benefits are being used to justify genetic research and the 
taxpayers’ investment, but the results being stopped from publication, then this 
serves the pharmaceutical industry too; in keeping their research and patented 
products out of regulatory scrutiny. 
Since the collapse of negotiations as to how to implement the Biological Weapons 
Convention’s governance,, the onus has been on scientists and individual research 
programs to follow voluntary Codes of Conduct. WHO stated that scientists 
themselves were in the best position to assess the risk of their own work. The priority 
given by the World Health Organization was to raise awareness of biosafety risks 
among life scientists through training and education. They hoped a culture of 
responsibility would facilitate this process. 
  
CRISPR has made the creation of biological toxins and their genetic delivery straight 
forward. Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering (MAGE) has made it possible to 
scale up production, simultaneously edit multiple targets, with no human scientific or 
ethical oversight. In vivo gene editing has become a reality, with hundreds of clinical 
trials being conducted in the US alone. Synthetic biology with its low genetic diversity 
is being widely used, with no impact studies on the multiple functions of existing 
microbiomes in human and environmental health. Any of the products of these 
technologies could be utilized to harm even more readily than perform their stated 
objectives, such as cure disease.  
Gain of function research is explicitly used to produce more virulent strains of known 
diseases with pandemic potential pathogens, while synthetic biology has been 
shown to have the potential to create artificial pathogens to recreate any disease. 
 It might be tempting to conclude that the risks are exacerbated by the wide 
availability of information online: Genome databases that contain digital genome 
information on pandemic pathogens. However, it is relevant to look at the threat of 
bioweapons from other perspectives, including motivations to create a bioweapon; 
what might be the objective of an attack and who is funding the research.  
For dual use technology research alone, 7.6 billion dollars has been spent; 6.1 billion 
by taxpayers and 1.5 billion by the military (Kennedy, 2021) Military funding could 
point to these technologies specifically being developed for military purposes, 
including biological weapons and surveillance. This would be another reason to 
withhold the results of the research, as classified. Already the National Defense 
Strategy research is exempt from oversight, even though it evolved from the US 
Bioweapons Program. It now focuses on strategies to assess, prevent, protect 
against, respond to, and recover from biological threats. They have an exemplary 
R&D group DARPA who lead the way in coupling innovation with biosecurity. 
DARPA started the Safe Gene program in 2018 to develop safety guidelines 
including:  
Techniques that allow gene editors to be switched off and back on again once inside 
a person or organism;  
Development of drugs and other agents to block or reduce the action of gene editors; 
and  

Tools to clean up environmental genomic “spills” and leave things as they were 
before  
Developing and validating methods of molecular confinement that minimize the risk 
of unwanted genome editing.  
https://www.phe.gov/Preparedness/biodefense-strategy/Pages/default.aspx (at 
bottom as well) 
New assessments of gene-editing, synthetic biology and gain of function research, in 
the context of bioweapons, may be needed. However, the unreasonable risks are 
both obvious and comparable, whether  the release is intentional or accidental.  
Noyce and Evans warned that the “advance of technology means that no disease-
causing organism can forever be eradicated.” This fundamentally changes the 
paradigm of the global health strategy, which is predicated on the ability to eradicate 
diseases, using vaccination or other immunization tools. Once eradicated, a disease 
like smallpox would never be a threat to our communities and the economy.  
However, modern biotechnology allows a wide array of agents to resurrect deadly 
viruses and reignite diseases that have already been eradicated at a great cost. This 
raises the question about the proper balance of interests: the global community and 
humanity on one side, and a small group of scientists,  biotechnology companies, 
pharmaceutical and military interests on the other. The former would no doubt 
strongly prefer these eradicated diseases to remain extinct, and see a ban on 
dangerous research. The latter see an interest in pursuing this avenue of research, 
without consideration for the broader public interest. 
Therefore, the role of governments becomes more important than ever: Tto monitor, 
regulate, and prevent any research that poses an unacceptable risk to the public. 
Academic institutions must develop young scientists’ awareness of the major threat 
of gene edited microorganisms entering the human or wider gene pool. Training 
should embed a code of conduct that takes into account the unpredictable interaction 
of genetically engineered organisms in nature and the potential misuse and 
weaponization of the technologies and their research.  
Our society has made great advances in the past several decades and managed to 
suppress, contain, or eradicate many infectious diseases that have plagued 
humanity for millennia. However biotechnology companies have also managed to 
suppress, contain and eradicate many scientific studies which question the safety of 
their products and the genetic engineering process itself. That research could have 
prevented the emerging and established conditions associated with GMOs in our 
food supply.  It is irresponsible for genetic research to be allowed to proliferate 
potential bioweapons; having not had to defend their reason for conducting the 
research in the first place; being under no obligation to share results and having 
provided no Biosecurity Evaluation. The legally-binding Biological Weapons 
Convention has been difficult to enforce until now. Each research project could be 
required to send an evidenced response to these basic guidelines, to get a license to 
proceed: 
 
• 
Preventing the development and possession of biological warfare 
agents or weapons;  
 
• 
Controlling access to dual-use biological materials, equipment, or 
associated information that could be used for hostile purposes;  
 
• 
Promoting the safe and secure handling of pathogens and toxins inside 
and outside the laboratory;  
 
• 
and ensuring that the risks from the most consequential types of 
biological research are properly identified, assessed, and mitigated before the work 

is carried out. 
  
Accepting that the threat from genetically engineered microbes is one of ‘mass 
destruction’ it is irresponsible to value unrestricted use of technology and commercial 
interests above it.

Frances and I met with Ole Dammegard on September 20th to discuss the urgency 
of this matter, it appeared counter intuitive and a major negative to release mosquito 
eggs as a health strategy. 
 
Ole organized a meeting with us and Professor Richard Claproth on September 21st 
2023. He realized the seriousness of the situation. We discussed how governments 
had been lobbied to believe that gene editing was not GMO, that is accurate safe 
and predictable, but the opposite is the truth. Vaccines, mosquitoes and other 
biotech products pose a massive threat to human health and the environment by 
permanently changing the Gene pool

Gene Drives 
 
In scientific terms, the World Mosquito Program (WMP) Wolbachia Method 
Mosquitoes are a Gene Drive.  
Gene drives are much more dangerous even than the genetically engineered 
mosquitoes released by Oxitec. 
 
Gene drives introduce a vast quantity of a new species into nature (Aedes Egypti 
permanently infected with Wolbachia bacteria, in this case), for which there is no 
existing evolutionary niche. What is so dangerous is that the micro-organism, 
Wolbachia Bacteria, and its host, the Aedes Egypt Mosquito, have been given a 
genetic advantage: Every surviving mosquito offspring from either the distributed 
eggs or future breeding with wild mosquitoes, will express the new genetic 
sequence, including the Wolbachia Bacteria. 
 
The distribution of mosquito eggs must be stopped as it will increase Bali’s mosquito 
population by millions.  
 
In nature, offspring would inherit genes from each parent, which protects insect 
biodiversity and means that unsuccessful gene sequences can die out.  
Even Oxitec’s genetically-engineered mosquitos were produced with an engineered 
‘limiting gene’, so that the new species would not perpetuate in the wild, the 
activation of an aggressive gene intended to decimate the wild population and also a 
fluorescent gene to identify and monitor the GE mosquitoes. However unsuccessful, 
Oxitec sought to reduce mosquito populations by releasing only males, who were 
thought not to bite. What has been produced in the Yogyakarta laboratory is a huge-
scale, epigenetic invasive species. Representatives of the World Mosquito Program 
state in several papers that they have no need to reduce the mosquito population. 
On the contrary, the plan is to release as many viable male and female eggs, to drive 
the dengue-resistant wolbachia-infected mosquitoes through the whole population. 
Also note that Oxitec had to withdraw their application to release mosquitoes in 
California this year. 
 
 The Bill Gates Foundation has FUNDED the majority of Gene Drive Research  
And the main interest in the DEVELOPMENT of Gene Drive technology are the US 
military,  
Both connected to the Centre for Disease Control, (US-based CDC) invested in the 
Wolbachia Method research here. 
 
There are international protocols requiring informed consent for the outdoor release 
of gene drives as they are irreversible. The majority of gene drive technology is for 
military purposes, and secondly for applications in Agriculture. Many countries, 
health and conservation organisations have formally requested a moratorium on 
even researching gene drive technology, because of the ecological implications 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtdnlranVZI Thomas, J, ETC Group. And also 
the impact on other species, including human health.

In WMP studies, Wolbachia is described as a ‘helpful’ bacteria and a ‘harmless’ 
bacteria but we do not know the infinite ways that this bacteria interacts and could 
interact. We don’t even know what is Wolbachia’s usual function in 50% of insects. 
With such huge funding from sources like The Bill Gates Foundation and 20 years 
support from the CDC and interest in this technology by the military, (and yet no 
reduction in disease yet), can ministers be sure that one of those funders does not 

know more about Wolbachia than we, the authorities that are being asked to deposit 
vast amounts into our own environment. (On November 14th, the WMP scientists 
disclosed to two of Gladiator Bangsa that they knew of 11 other viruses in the 
mosquitoes and interactions with other species that caused a spike in Japanese 
Encephalitis.   
 
Contradictory Descriptions of The Wolbachia Bacteria’s Role  
 
The mayor used the term ‘exposed to’ Wolbachia. The Yogyakarta trial reports used 
the term ‘infected with’ the bacteria and the researchers describe a process whereby 
they tried for many months to intentionally ‘inject’ Wolbachia into the mosquito eggs. 
The meaning of the words ‘exposed to’ suggest accident, ‘infected with’ alerts the 
reader to the very same risks as becoming infected with any other disease. The case 
studies and research reports are all extremely confused and confusing, with what 
organisms they hope to infect, how to perpetuate that infection, what infections they 
attempted for years to perpetuate and what infections they hope to prevent. The 
reports and results only confirm that the one species’ health that is to be boosted is 
the mosquitoes, with a reinforced indestructible immune system. This has been done 
in the vague hope that mosquitoes continue to not transmit diseases in their bite. 
About these results results are said to be promising, likely and negligible, with no 
data evidence of safety or efficacy at all.     
 
The main indicator that Wolbachia Bacteria could be being used as a bioweapon to 
deliver disruption to the female reproductive system is that the  
eggs of uninfected female mosquitoes mating with a Wolbachia-infected male will not 
hatch. They give no explanation of why not. 
 
Some studies show that Wolbachia bacteria cause ovarian tumours. 
   
In 2011, the Yogyakarta research did succeed in developing a method for 
introducing a Wolbachia bacteria into the Aedes Aegypti species, without using 
genetically  
engineered mosquitoes, or gene-edited bacteria. Unfortunately, this is significant to 
safety and risk assessments and regulatory oversight for distribution. This is 
because it is common practice for laboratories to avoid environmental and human 
health impact studies and compliance by arguing that there was no unnatural or 
engineered organisms or microorganisms introduced. Reports state that the 
mosquitoes have all been bred through sexual reproduction rather than 
manufactured. The laboratory in Yogyakarta has been collecting native varieties and 
breeding at their facility since 2013.  
 
The Indonesian University research facilities, may have gone to great lengths to 
avoid genetic engineering but the Wolbachia bacteria they injected into the eggs 
must have been isolated in the first place. Who supplied the Wolbachia bacteria? 
 
Can ministers exclude the possibility that the Wolbachia bacteria can be used as an 
inoculation, as was Bill Gates goal to find a needle-less delivery system for 
vaccines? Can the Bali authorities be sure that this whole research project was not 
to make Indonesia the authors of their own demise; another assault to reduce the 
human population through various sterilising and other methods.  

 
Wolbachia infection usually affects the reproduction of their hosts to promote their 
own proliferation and transmission (https://www.ncbi.nim.nih.gov pic - ref attached 
This paper also demonstrates the rise in Aedes Egypti population that Wolbachia-
infection will guarantee). Cytoplasmic incompatibility allows Wolbachia to invade 
insect populations by causing embryonic mortality when uninfected females mate 
with infected males, conferring a selective advantage. There is a rising public health 
problem of incompatibility between mother and embryo. There is also the protein 
spikes causing immuno storms, also associated with Wolbachia. This could have a 
parallel in the covid 19 vaccines, rendering people unable to fight off other diseases. 
“The whole Wolbachia wAibB genome consists of 165 encompassing 49 scaffolds. It 
has 1,239,814 bp and an average GC content of 33.7%. The genome contains 1,209 
predicted protein-coding sequences with an average length of 349 bp. 34 tRNA 
genes, and one rRNA copy split in 2 operons (165 and 5S-23S).  
 
There will be no way to monitor what contaminations, species collapse, conditions 
and cases of fever were caused by what vectors,  
let alone what cases were avoided. 
 
Risk assessment for how this complex bacteria will be driven to mutate to compete 
with other diseases: How the bacteria will spread through horizontal gene transfer to 
other species and humans in particular with a threat to pregnant women, the 
possibility of driving diseases more serious than they are now (as happened with the 
initially  Zika virus) It needs to be asked, what percentage of the funding and 
research was dedicated to testing what would happen in the environment? And 
those results would then need to be in the public domain for informed consent to be 
possible. 
 
For the field studies of this scientific experiment, the parameters used for the trials in 
Yogyakarta were 1) incidence of dengue and 2) severity of cases. This suggests that 
Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever is being presupposed to be a severe case of Dengue 
when actually it is a different strain altogether. The producers of this health strategy 
make no claim that the release of mosquitoes will reduce the severity of the 
diseases. The trials do not mention whether other diseases were present or even 
tested for. Releasing a flying organism whose habitat is water makes a mockery of 
the idea of a control group, to weigh up the risks and benefits.  
 
When the symptoms of fever, internal and external bleeding, spike protein auto 
immune conditions, etc start to rise, the health system will have no way of 
distinguishing which were caused by Dengue, Malaria, a variant of Covid 19, an 
increased allergic intolerance to mosquito bites. Let alone estimating how many 
cases of serious illness were avoided due to such a release.  
 
I anticipate that the Minister for Health is going to be so horrified at the extent he has 
been personally and professionally used, to successfully implement this heinous plan 
that he won’t just stop this mosquito release but will also be determined to reach out 
to other nations and demand redress. Block the WHO treaty, implement 
compensation and karmic punishment for the perpetrators. 
The Funding Was A Drop In The Ocean  
The end game for the World Health Organization is the signing and ratification of a 

global treaty in the next few months 
by every country in the world, which gives the W.H.O.  
the power to decide a global health strategy and pandemic response,  
Declare pandemic emergencies 
Provide, deliver and mandate vaccines, lockdowns, distancing, and other smart 
technologies.  
 
By body, my choice 
 Health decisions will be above individual governments, doctors, and the choices of 
individual men and women 
 
Biological Scatterbombs 
In the last pandemic and earlier biological releases, GMOs into agriculture/food and 
now insect releases  
The population was introduced to the idea: My Body Your Choice 
As people were coerced and bullied into staying at home and listening to instructions 
delivered by their public servants through captured technology and information 
channels and then 
Turned out only to receive an experimental vaccine - the first pharmaceutical drug to 
ever be allowed on the market, without its active ingredients being in the public 
domain. 
Publicly sponsored gene therapies, bypassing independent safety studies by being 
allowed to patent their research 
Consensus was achieved 
With a marketing strategy: 
Call the genetically engineered gene-therapy a ‘vaccine’ 
People are used to getting vaccines 
Get the Family General Practitioners/Doctors to administer it 
Because People trust their doctors  
 
And then mandate the delivery of a vaccine or other health strategy  
 
Funding  
 
The hundreds of billions spent could have raised the standard of living 
Billions have been spent on this scientific experiment for improved public health in 
Bali when that amount of money would obviously have raised the quality of life, 
housing, nutrition, sanitisation, care, drinking water quality and water management, 
and reduced mosquito breeding grounds and people’s exposure to diseases, related 
to poverty and poor infrastructure, for the whole population. Somehow the authorities 
have been gas-lighted into believing that it would be beneficial to make every fresh 
water source, treatment plant, pool, reservoir and irrigation system, not only a 
mosquito breeding ground but even plan and budget for the systematic distribution of 
mosquito eggs in North, South, East and West of Depensa. Can we see exactly 
where those distribution points are and if not, why not? 
 
Were the army brought into the ceremony of releasing the mosquitos in Yogyakarta, 
in order to make sure there was no resistance to the plan? Will any party be allowed 
to withhold this map of planned distribution points for any reason? Ministers need to 
be familiar with that map, as they will be accountable for any contamination down-

stream. And the map needs to be published so that independent experts and 
community figures can contribute their concerns and use the mapped information to 
block the highest risk areas, and or the whole roll out. Regulations include not 
releasing mosquitoes within 500metres of a waste water treatment plant, orchard, 
crops, or livestock facilities. In our instance eggs have to be near water. 
 
The Law 
We have a Carter Heiner Protocol (? I have not seen this written down only spoken 
about so hopefully we can find it and use it) for safety, which is intended to require 
risk assessments for these kind of releases. There are also strict  export standards 
required by the European Union. There is a direct parallel for Bali, with the Target 
Malaria releases in Brazil. That research consortium is saying they don’t need to do 
these kind of risk assessment. They are arguing that because the mosquitoes are 
being bred in Brazil, that means they are exempt from export requirements. These 
were eggs that were to be flown to Brazil from somewhere else. Just because the 
mosquitoes have been bred here, does not mean we should not meet export 
standard. Does Indonesia plan to send eggs produced here to other countries too? It 
is a way to not take responsibility for the effects of the releases.  
Consent 
When a scheme is fully intended to have an impact on people’s health, you need 
people to engage and should require informed consent. Can the authorities be sure 
that the process is not just being run by the organizations who are producing them. 
(Dr H Wallace GeneWatch) 
 
Are all the standards and processes in place, in Bali? Which regulatory body will 
oversee compliance with those standards. Do they have the fulll studies and have 
they conducted their own independent risk assessments for human health, and 
environmental impact. Or is there is a lack of transparency and their approval of the 
mosquitoes release assumed?  
 
The public have been informed rather than consulted. 
     
Billions spent, plus twenty years time (in Yogyakarta University), energy and 
application of the finest minds and experts in the region, was a more economical 
disease prevention plan than other health strategies? No 
 
Reports and press releases specifically promote the economy and affordability of the 
Wolbachia Method Mosquito strategy over the cost of a Dengue vaccine. This is how 
the Indonesian Authorities have been programmed to buy and sell one or other toxic, 
life-threatening experimental product. 
 
The Bill Gates Foundation couldn’t do it without them. It is a matter of trust. Local 
people have a real belief that there are good mosquitoes and bad mosquitoes. The 
good mosquitoes have been made or bred by reliable, sensible and responsible not-
for-profit organisations.   
 
Vaccine or mosquitoes, make your choice 
These alternative srategies; mosquitoes and vaccines, are repeatedly shared, even 
though neither are a solution, specifically to normalise the idea that the Health 
Authorities have to provide one or the other.  

 
These are not social solutions, people-centred solutions, and they do not use one 
element of Balinese or wider Indonesian medicine or understanding of the human 
body, life and place in nature. Furthermore the choice of mosquitoes or vaccines, 
serves as a threat to individuals or communities who oppose the massive mosquito 
release: It says; if you don’t consent to the mosquitoes, you will have to accept 
another mandatory vaccine program. Also, you will be referred to as partly 
responsible for the considerable financial burden of the vaccine research, purchase 
and roll out, on the public purse. 
  
Of course, it is nonsense to say that hundreds of billions have been spent on the 
mosquito research, and then argue it was cost effective and cheaper than any other 
strategy. When it clearly wasn’t. 
 
Curfew 
There is now news being published of times of the day when mosquitoes bite: 
between 6 and 8am and between 5 and 8pm. This is the beginning of the 
introduction of a curfew, a provisional lockdown for Bali residents’ own good when 
the mosquitoes are released. 
 
Smart City 
There is a very real threat that the population of Bali will not be able to manage the 
uprising in disease and allergic reactions, whatever cause they are assigned to. To 
cover up this destruction, the only course of action is to burn the habitats and land. 
The habitats include all houses. All houses of the poorer residents at least and all the 
plant life.  
 
Whatever the cause of this apparently spontaneous fire could be, there is a risk upon 
risk of destroying life on the island. 
 
We sent our next lot of documents to Richard for the Health Minister titled  
“In scientific terms the WMP Wolbachia method mosquitoes are a gene drive, Genes 
Drives are much more dangerous even than the genetically engineered mosquitoes 
released by Oxitec”. 
 
Over the following days many Zoom meetings were held with Frances and I along 
with Gladiator bangsa team members to prepare for the upcoming important zoom 
meeting open discussion 
 
September 26th we received a scale up report and implementation document called 
pilot project Wolbachia from the Minister of Health so that we could understand his 
reasons for the release. This report shows evidence of IP Technology being used in 
the mosquitoes. 
 
Sent document: Summary: 
Frances, Margaret, Mary and Richard discussed the potential dangers and 
implications of an invention related to a gene drive, which has never been trialed 
outside a laboratory. Frances expressed concerns about the supercharged immune 
system of the introduced species and the lack of provision to reduce the population 
of mosquitoes. She also highlighted the risks of unintentional migration, the 

involvement of the military governing body Darpa, and the potential for intellectual 
property challenges to be the only legal concern.  
 
Margaret and Frances discussed the percentage reduction in mosquito populations 
and the potential risks of introducing new species of mosquitoes. Frances also raised 
concerns about the potential dangers of a nanotechnology that can monitor soil 
fertilizer and bacteria and the risks of genetically modified mosquitoes spreading 
pathogens.  
 
Additionally, Frances and Margaret discussed the issue of malaria cases resulting 
from the release of mosquitoes and the need for the government to guarantee 
assistance for those affected. The team also discussed the importance of 
considering national security in the project and the need for better risk assessments 
and more studies on this topic. Lastly, they discussed the need to socialize a 
program to the local community and the importance of informing them of their rights 
and potential impacts. 
 
 
• 
Gene Drive Invention and Ecosystem Disruption Discussed 
We discussed an invention related to a gene drive, which has never been trialed 
outside a laboratory. Frances clarified the potential dangers of a gene drive, 
explaining that it introduces a novel species into an ecosystem and can disrupt it. 
Furthermore, she expressed concern over the invention's supercharged immune 
system and lack of provision to reduce the population of mosquitoes. There were 
some technical difficulties with the recording, resulting in some loss of information. 
 
 
• 
Mosquito Egg Threat: Wolbachia and Allergic Risks 
Frances expressed concerns about the potential for a significant increase in 
mosquito populations due to the discovery that mosquito eggs carry pathogens and 
a symbiotic bacteria, Wolbachia, which could be passed on to future generations. 
She highlighted the risk of allergic reactions from multiple bites and the importance 
of understanding the frequency and timing of egg release. Frances also noted that 
the bacteria, Wolbachia, has been seen to cause health issues in humans and there 
is a need to track where the eggs are being released due to their attraction to water 
sources. 
 
 
• 
Genetically Modified Mosquitoes and Intellectual Property Concerns 
Frances expressed concerns about the potential dangers and implications of 
exporting genetically modified mosquitoes, referencing their proximity to water 
sources and the possibility of unintentional migration. She also highlighted the 
involvement of the East-west, North and South Irrigation Company in the release of 
mosquitoes in Maui and the associated risks. Frances also discussed the role of 
Darpa, the military governing body, in overseeing gene drive technology and its 
potential applications. Lastly, she expressed her belief that the only legal concern 
these entities have is the potential for intellectual property challenges, rather than the 
potential harm to public health. 
 
• 
Mosquito Population Reduction: Implications and Risks 
 
Margaret and Frances discussed the percentage reduction in mosquito 
populations  and its implications. They questioned why there isn't a hundred percent 
reduction  
after twenty years of efforts and raised concerns about the potential 
risks of  
introducing new species of mosquitoes. They highlighted the lack of 

understanding  
about the impact on different diseases such as dengue and 
dengue hemorrhagic  
fever, as well as the potential long-term effects on the 
immune systems of  mosquitoes and humans. They also touched upon the funding 
implications of the  project, with Frances  
suggesting that the promise of 
reduced dengue cases might not  be enough to justify a twenty-year investment. 
 
 
• 
Vector or Vaccine: A Public Choice 
 
Frances discussed the perceived dilemma of accepting mosquitoes or a 
vaccine,  
suggesting that the public might have to choose between the two. She 
pointed out  that the Gates Foundation's 2003 plan was to find a way to deliver 
vaccines without  
a needle, and identified the mosquito as a potential vector for 
multiple boosters.  Frances also  
raised concerns about the potential for 
genes, including  
nanotechnology, to be smuggled in through the original bacteria 
used in the  research. 
 
 
• 
Concerns on Nanotechnology and Genetic Modification 
 
Frances expressed concern over potential risks associated with a 
nanotechnology that  
can monitor soil fertilizer and bacteria, and also 
potentially interact with them. She  
also discussed the dangers of releasing 
genetically modified mosquitoes into the  
environment due to the lack of 
tracking and monitoring capabilities. Frances  mentioned the possibility of these 
mosquitoes interacting with other microbes and  
organisms, leading to 
unknown health and ecosystem impacts. She also connected  
this to a possible 
curfew idea, which she felt was an attempt to limit the exposure  
of people to 
mosquitoes. Frances highlighted the issue of genetically engineered  
eggs and 
the potential they hold for spreading pathogens. 
 
 
• 
Malaria Outbreak and Accountability Discussed 
 
Frances and Margaret discussed the issue of malaria cases resulting from the 
release  
of mosquitoes. They agreed that the government needs to guarantee 
assistance  for  
those  affected and hold the responsible parties accountable. 
They noted that the  regulatory systems are not in place and the governance should 
be by the  
people  
who release them. 
 
 
• 
Biohazards, Malaria, and Financial Risks Discussion 
 
There was a discussion about the potential risks and opportunities associated 
with  various biohazards and malaria projects. Frances expressed concern about 
financial  
and health risks, and the possibility of malicious use of genetic 
engineering tools. She  
suggested that targeting the World Health Organization 
could lead to financial 
 
compensation for wasted time and risks. Additionally, Frances highlighted the 
 
importance of knowing the origin and plan of these hazards. The format of the 
 
meeting for Gladiator Bangsa will also changed to accommodate the 
presence of  scientists from Government of Indonesia including the research team 
from  University of Gajahmada 
 
 
• 
National Security in Project Discussed 
 
We discussed the importance of considering national security in a project. We 
 
acknowledged that the involvement of intelligence personnel could potentially 
cause  issues, but also noted its importance for the project. Frances suggested that 

they  should  
persist with the intelligence personnel for now. Additionally, we 
talked about  the need for credible answers to questions about the project and the 
potential for  legal implications. Lastly, we mentioned the need for better risk 
assessments and  more studies on this topic. 
 
 
• 
Community Socialization and Consent Letter Discussion 
 
The team discussed the need to socialize a program to the local community, 
with a  focus on informing them of their rights and potential impacts. A key point of 
 
contention was the requirement for a letter of consent from the 44 local 
villages.  
There was also discussion about the importance of conducting a risk 
assessment,  referencing a  
successful effort in California. The team decided to 
seek a transcript of  this meeting to aid in their future strategies. 
 
 
• 
New Websites and Moderation Needs 
 
Richard discussed the introduction of two side, one of which would represent 
the  
government. They also discussed the need for a moderator to manage 
interactions  between users of the sites. The format of the discussion  was 
described as different  
from previous ones. Richard suggesting the need for a 
more indirect approach, such  
as trapping them. Frances will have the first 
chance to speak on the new sites. 
 
 
• 
Debating Risks of Mosquito Genetic Drive in Indonesia 
 
There was a detailed discussion about a mosquito program involving genetic 
drive,  which was claimed to be a first for Indonesia. The team debated the potential 
dangers  
of this genetic drive versus genetic engineering, with an emphasis on 
the need to  elude rather than attack opponents. The conversation also touched on 
a factory in  Brazil producing mosquito eggs, and the potential for disaster due to 
previous issues  
with mosquito releases in Brazil. The team ended with the 
acknowledgment that a  
risk assessment might have been conducted. 
 
 
• 
Legal Strategy and Consent Issues  
The team discussed their strategy for a future legal challenge. Margaret and Frances 
agreed that they didn't need to share their questions with the opposing party, as they 
felt it was more advantageous to know the answers they would be asked. Richard 
emphasized the importance of their conversation being recorded and later 
transcribed, noting that the information could be used later. They discussed their 
plan to share the transcript with the local Parliament and village leaders. The team 
also discussed the issue of the government not needing to gain local people's 
consent, a topic they aimed to clarify in their future discourse. 
 
 
 
• 
Managing Risks and Communication Strategies 
Frances discussed the importance of understanding and managing the risks 
associated with gene drives. There was a focus on preparation for an upcoming 
meeting and the need for effective communication strategies. The team also 
discussed the potential for conflict management and the importance of selecting the 
right people for the meeting. The next  meeting is to be live-streamed, and there was 
a concern about the attendance of certain individuals.  
 
 
• 
Space Army and Darpa Concerns: Potential Attack 

Frances expressed her concerns about an alleged connection between the Space 
Army and Darpa, which had reportedly caused damage to Maui. She also suggested 
that there might be a potential major attack. The team  agreed with her concerns and 
mentioned the need for more time with the group. It was noted that another meeting 
might be necessary to discuss these issues further, possibly in October. 
 
Next Steps 
1. We have to consider action items from the discussion.  
2. Investigate the claims made by the World Mosquito Program and their reduction of 
mosquito populations. 
 3. Look into the potential risks associated with the release of genetically modified 
mosquitoes.  
4. Obtain a transcript of the meeting (in California?) for further research on risk 
assessments.  
 
We also looked at the risk assessment which identified 50 hazards   
 
27th September 2023 
Points Clarity Document followed Summary above 
In scientific terms, the World Mosquito Program (WMP) Wolbachia Method 
Mosquitoes are a Gene Drive.  
Gene drives are much more dangerous even than the genetically engineered 
mosquitoes released by Oxitec. 
 
Gene drives introduce a vast quantity of a new species into nature (Aedes Egypti 
permanently infected with Wolbachia bacteria, in this case), for which there is no 
existing evolutionary niche. What is so dangerous is that the micro-organism, 
Wolbachia Bacteria, and its host, the Aedes Egypt Mosquito, have been given a 
genetic advantage: Every surviving mosquito offspring from either the distributed 
eggs or future breeding with wild mosquitoes, will express the new genetic 
sequence, including the Wolbachia Bacteria. 
 
The distribution of mosquito eggs must be stopped as it will increase Bali’s mosquito 
population by millions.  
 
In nature, offspring would inherit genes from each parent, which protects insect 
biodiversity and means that unsuccessful gene sequences can die out.  
Even Oxitec’s genetically-engineered mosquitos were produced with an engineered 
‘limiting gene’, so that the new species would not perpetuate in the wild, the 
activation of an aggressive gene intended to decimate the wild population and also a 
fluorescent gene to identify and monitor the GE mosquitoes. However unsuccessful, 
Oxitec sought to reduce mosquito populations by releasing only males, who were 
thought not to bite. What has been produced in the Yogyakarta laboratory is a huge-
scale, epigenetic invasive species. Representatives of the World Mosquito Program 
state in several papers that they have no need to reduce the mosquito population. 
On the contrary, the plan is to release as many viable male and female eggs, to drive 
the dengue-resistant wolbachia-infected mosquitoes through the whole population. 
Also note that Oxitec had to withdraw their application to release mosquitoes in 
California this year. 
 

 The Bill Gates Foundation has FUNDED the majority of Gene Drive Research  
And the main interest in the DEVELOPMENT of Gene Drive technology are the US 
military,  
Both connected to the Centre for Disease Control, (US-based CDC) invested in the 
Wolbachia Method research here. 
 
There are international protocols requiring informed consent for the outdoor release 
of gene drives as they are irreversible. The majority of gene drive technology is for 
military purposes, and secondly for applications in Agriculture. Many countries, 
health and conservation organisations have formally requested a moratorium on 
even researching gene drive technology, because of the ecological implications 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtdnlranVZI Thomas, J, ETC Group. And also 
the impact on other species, including human health. 
 
Indonesian Achievements but a more global agenda and huge responsibility 
 
The Wolbachia Method discoveries are Indonesian but the research was requested 
and funded specifically to meet Bill Gates’ objectives. Research here started in 2004, 
after Bill Gates chose mosquito control for disease prevention as the research area 
to be studied and provided the funding, as part of his Global Strategy. 
https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/268873/PMC2572389.pdf?sequence=1  
This was a list which identified: No. 7. Develop a genetic strategy to deplete or 
incapacitate a disease-transmitting insect population and 3. Develop needle-free 
delivery systems  for vaccines.  
amongst its 14 objectives: 
The 14 Grand Challenges in Global Health: 
Improve childhood vaccines: 
1. Create effective single-dose vaccines that can be used soon after birth.  
2. Prepare vaccines that do not requirere frigeration. 
3. Develop needle-free delivery systems for vaccines.

status.  
14. Develop technologies that allow assessment of individuals for multiple conditions 
or 
pathogens at point-of-care. 
 
 
In WMP studies, Wolbachia is described as a ‘helpful’ bacteria and a ‘harmless’ 
bacteria but we do not know the infinite ways that this bacteria interacts and could 
interact. We don’t even know what is Wolbachia’s usual function in 50% of insects. 
With such huge funding from sources like The Bill Gates Foundation and 20 years 
support from the CDC and interest in this technology by the military, (and yet no 
reduction in disease yet), can ministers be sure that one of those funders does not 
know more about Wolbachia than we (the authorities that are being asked to deposit 
vast amounts into their own environment).  
 
Contradictory Descriptions of The Wolbachia Bacteria’s Role  
 
The mayor used the term ‘exposed to’ Wolbachia. The Yogyakarta trial reports used 
the term ‘infected with’ the bacteria and the researchers describe a process whereby 
they tried for many months to intentionally ‘inject’ Wolbachia into the mosquito eggs. 
The meaning of the words ‘exposed to’ suggest accident, ‘infected with’ alerts the 
reader to the very same risks as becoming infected with any other disease. The case 
studies and research reports are all extremely confused and confusing, with what 
organisms they hope to infect, how to perpetuate that infection, what infections they 
attempted for years to perpetuate and what infections they hope to prevent. The 
reports and results only confirm that the one species’ health that is to be boosted is 
the mosquitoes, with a reinforced indestructible immune system. This has been done 
in the vague hope that mosquitoes continue to not transmit diseases in their bite. 
About these results results are said to be promising, likely and negligible, with no 
data evidence of safety or efficacy at all.     
 
The main indicator that Wolbachia Bacteria could be being used as a bioweapon to 
deliver disruption to the female reproductive system is that the  
eggs of uninfected female mosquitoes mating with a Wolbachia-infected male will not 
hatch. They give no explanation of why not. 
 
Some studies show that Wolbachia bacteria cause ovarian tumours. 
   
In 2011, the Yogyakarta research did succeed in developing a method for 
introducing a Wolbachia bacteria into the Aedes Aegypti species, without using 
genetically  
engineered mosquitoes, or gene-edited bacteria. Unfortunately, this is significant to 
safety and risk assessments and regulatory oversight for distribution. This is 
because it is common practice for laboratories to avoid environmental and human 
health impact studies and compliance by arguing that there was no unnatural or 
engineered organisms or microorganisms introduced. Reports state that the 
mosquitoes have all been bred through sexual reproduction rather than 

manufactured. The laboratory in Yogyakarta has been collecting native varieties and 
breeding at their facility since 2013.  
 
The Indonesian University research facilities, may have gone to great lengths to 
avoid genetic engineering but the Wolbachia bacteria they injected into the eggs 
must have been isolated in the first place. Who supplied the Wolbachia bacteria? 
 
Can ministers exclude the possibility that the Wolbachia bacteria can be used as an 
inoculation, as was Bill Gates goal to find a needle-less delivery system for 
vaccines? Can the Bali authorities be sure that this whole research project was not 
to make Indonesia the authors of their own demise; another assault to reduce the 
human population through various sterilising and other methods.  
 
Wolbachia infection usually affects the reproduction of their hosts to promote their 
own proliferation and transmission (https://www.ncbi.nim.nih.gov pic - ref attached 
This paper also demonstrates the rise in Aedes Egypti population that Wolbachia-
infection will guarantee). Cytoplasmic incompatibility allows Wolbachia to invade 
insect populations by causing embryonic mortality when uninfected females mate 
with infected males, conferring a selective advantage. There is a rising public health 
problem of incompatibility between mother and embryo. There is also the protein 
spikes causing immuno storms, also associated with Wolbachia. This could have a 
parallel in the covid 19 vaccines, rendering people unable to fight off other diseases. 
“The whole Wolbachia wAibB genome consists of 165 encompassing 49 scaffolds. It 
has 1,239,814 bp and an average GC content of 33.7%. The genome contains 1,209 
predicted protein-coding sequences with an average length of 349 bp. 34 tRNA 
genes, and one rRNA copy split in 2 operons (165 and 5S-23S).  
 
There will be no way to monitor what contaminations, species collapse, conditions 
and cases of fever were caused by what vectors,  
let alone what cases were avoided. 
 
Risk assessment for how this complex bacteria will be driven to mutate to compete 
with other diseases: How the bacteria will spread through horizontal gene transfer to 
other species and humans in particular with a threat to pregnant women, the 
possibility of driving diseases more serious than they are now (as happened with the 
initially  Zika virus) It needs to be asked, what percentage of the funding and 
research was dedicated to testing what would happen in the environment? And 
those results would then need to be in the public domain for informed consent to be 
possible. 
 
 
For the field studies of this scientific experiment, the parameters used for the trials in 
Yogyakarta were 1) incidence of dengue and 2) severity of cases. This suggests that 
Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever is being presupposed to be a severe case of Dengue 
when actually it is a different strain altogether. The producers of this health strategy 
make no claim that the release of mosquitoes will reduce the severity of the 
diseases. The trials do not mention whether other diseases were present or even 
tested for. Releasing a flying organism whose habitat is water makes a mockery of 
the idea of a control group, to weigh up the risks and benefits.  
 

When the symptoms of fever, internal and external bleeding, spike protein auto 
immune conditions, etc start to rise, the health system will have no way of 
distinguishing which were caused by Dengue, Malaria, a variant of Covid 19, an 
increased allergic intolerance to mosquito bites. Let alone estimating how many 
cases of serious illness were avoided due to such a release.  
 
 The females will still bite and the only benefit is that in the limited studies done, the 
Wolbachia -infected mosquitos will not carry disease and therefore spread it through 
their bite. There is no mention of how well they carry Zika, or Yellow Fever or the 
other strains of Dengue. 
 
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKVikYJOjis their own video explanation.  
The studies even admit that it is unclear how the inserted Wolbachia seems to out-
compete Dengue. 
 
 and other diseases in the species, making them less likely to transmit disease.       
  
There is no way to assess the risk. The study identifies over 50 hazards and 
describe them as unlikely. 
  
 
I anticipate that the Minister for Health is going to be so horrified at the extent he has 
been personally and professionally used, to successfully implement this heinous plan 
that he won’t just stop this mosquito release but will also be determined to reach out 
to other nations and demand redress. Block the WHO treaty, implement 
compensation and karmic punishment for the perpetrators. 
The Funding Was A Drop In The Ocean  
The end game for the World Health Organization is the signing and ratification of a 
global treaty in the next few months 
by every country in the world, which gives the W.H.O.  
the power to decide a global health strategy and pandemic response,  
Declare pandemic emergencies 
Provide, deliver and mandate vaccines, lockdowns, distancing, and other smart 
technologies.

 Health decisions will be above individual governments, doctors, and the choices of 
individual men and women 
 
Biological Scatter bombs 
In the last pandemic and earlier biological releases, GMOs into agriculture/food and 
now insect releases  
The population was introduced to the idea: My Body Your Choice 
As people were coerced and bullied into staying at home and listening to instructions 
delivered by their public servants through captured technology and information 
channels and then 
Turned out only to receive an experimental vaccine - the first pharmaceutical drug to 
ever be allowed on the market, without its active ingredients being in the public 
domain. 
Publicly sponsored gene therapies, bypassing independent safety studies by being 

allowed to patent their research 
Consensus was achieved 
With a marketing strategy: 
Call the genetically engineered gene-therapy a ‘vaccine’ 
People are used to getting vaccines 
Get the Family General Practitioners/Doctors to administer it 
Because People trust their doctors   
 
And then mandate the delivery of a vaccine or other health strategy  
 
 
Funding  
 
The hundreds of billions spent could have raised the standard of living 
Billions have been spent on this scientific experiment for improved public health in 
Bali when that amount of money would obviously have raised the quality of life, 
housing, nutrition, sanitisation, care, drinking water quality and water management, 
and reduced mosquito breeding grounds and people’s exposure to diseases, related 
to poverty and poor infrastructure, for the whole population. Somehow the authorities 
have been gas-lighted into believing that it would be beneficial to make every fresh 
water source, treatment plant, pool, reservoir and irrigation system, not only a 
mosquito breeding ground but even plan and budget for the systematic distribution of 
mosquito eggs in North, South, East and West of Depensa. Can we see exactly 
where those distribution points are and if not, why not? 
 
Were the armiy brought into the ceremony of releasing the mosquitos in Yogyakarta, 
in order to make sure there was no resistance to the plan? Will any party be allowed 
to withhold this map of planned distribution points for any reason? Ministers need to 
be familiar with that map, as they will be accountable for any contamination down-
stream. And the map needs to be published so that independent experts and 
community figures can contribute their concerns and use the mapped information to 
block the highest risk areas, and or the whole roll out. Regulations include not 
releasing mosquitoes within 500metres of a waste water treatment plant, orchard, 
crops, or livestock facilities. In our instance eggs have to be near water. 
 
The Law 
We have a Carter Heiner Protocol (? I have not seen this written down only spoken 
about so hopefully we can find it and use it) for safety, which is intended to require 
risk assessments for these kind of releases. There are also strict  export standards 
required by the European Union. There is a direct parallel for Bali, with the Target 
Malaria releases in Brazil. That research consortium is saying they don’t need to do 
these kind of risk assessment. They are arguing that because the mosquitoes are 
being bred in Brazil, that means they are exempt from export requirements. These 
were eggs that were to be flown to Brazil from somewhere else. Just because the 
mosquitoes have been bred here, does not mean we should not meet export 
standard. Does Indonesia plan to send eggs produced here to other countries too? It 
is a way to not take responsibility for the effects of the releases.  
Consent 
When a scheme is fully intended to have an impact on people’s health, you need 
people to engage and should require informed consent. Can the authorities be sure 

that the process is not just being run by the organizations who are producing them. 
(Dr H Wallace GeneWatch) 
 
Are all the standards and processes in place, in Bali? Which regulatory body will 
oversee compliance with those standards. Do they have the fulll studies and have 
they conducted their own independent risk assessments for human health, and 
environmental impact. Or is there is a lack of transparency and their approval of the 
mosquitoes release assumed?  
 
The public have been informed rather than consulted. 
     
Billions spent, plus twenty years time, energy and application of the finest minds and 
experts in the region, was a more economical disease prevention plan than other 
health strategies? No 
 
Reports and press releases specifically promote the economy and affordability of the 
Wolbachia Method Mosquito strategy over the cost of a Dengue vaccine. This is how 
the Indonesian Authorities have been programmed to buy and sell one or other toxic, 
life-threatening experimental product. 
 
The Bill Gates Foundation couldn’t do it without them. It is a matter of trust. Local 
people have a real belief that there are good mosquitoes and bad mosquitoes. The 
good mosquitoes have been made or bred by reliable, sensible and responsible not-
for-profit organisations.   
 
Vaccine or mosquitoes, make your choice 
These alternative srategies; mosquitoes and vaccines, are repeatedly shared, even 
though neither are a solution, specifically to normalise the idea that the Health 
Authorities have to provide one or the other.  
 
These are not social solutions, people-centred solutions, and they do not use one 
element of Balinese or wider Indonesian medicine or understanding of the human 
body, life and place in nature. Furthermore the choice of mosquitoes or vaccines, 
serves as a threat to individuals or communities who oppose the massive mosquito 
release: It says; if you don’t consent to the mosquitoes, you will have to accept 
another mandatory vaccine program. Also, you will be referred to as partly 
responsible for the considerable financial burden of the vaccine research, purchase 
and roll out, on the public purse. 
  
Of course, it is nonsense to say that hundreds of billions have been spent on the 
mosquito research, and then argue it was cost effective and cheaper than any other 
strategy. When it clearly wasn’t. 
 
Curfew 
There is now news being published of times of the day when mosquitoes bite: 
between 6 and 8am and between 5 and 8pm. This is the beginning of the 
introduction of a curfew, a provisional lockdown for Bali residents’ own good when 
the mosquitoes are released. 
 
Smart City 

There is a very real threat that the population of Bali will not be able to manage the 
uprising in disease and allergic reactions, whatever cause they are assigned to. To 
cover up this destruction, the only course of action is to burn the habitats and land. 
The habitats include all houses. All houses of the poorer residents at least and all the 
plant life.  
 
Whatever the cause of this apparently spontaneous fire could be, there is a risk upon 
risk of destroying life on this island. 
   
Papers conclude that no-one is obviously liable yet for the amount of money that 
may be payable in apology and compensation and remedy. 
WMP impact spokeswoman mentions, without explanation, that the eggs of an 
uninfected female, following mating with an infected male just won’t hatch. But why 
will they not hatch? Other papers found that Wolbachia had been linked to ovarian 
tumours and reproduction system defects. 
 
 To notice a change in reproduction capacity of a species and then not conduct 
major studies before distributing these infected eggs, is putting women and babies at 
an unacceptable level of risk. Other Wolbachia-related diseases are water-borne and 
there is no way to predict how gene transfer and other interactions will trigger the 
Wolbachia bacteria, or drive a more aggressive strain of the dengue. Wolbachia is 
associated with two mechanisms of viral protection. 
https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2020.626329/full Activation of host 
immunity (the host being the mosquito) or competition with disease viruses for 
cellular resources. In studies, in laboratory conditions the wolbachia out-competed 
the dengue virus but there is no way of knowing how either microbe would evolve to 
survive in nature. Even the studies that described the results as ‘promising’, ‘hopeful’ 
and the Wolbachia as ‘helpful’ even stated that it was ‘unclear why’ it worked. That is 
not a scientific blind tested refuted, Changing a whole

California Blocked it following the warnings and dangers and failures, all of which 
apply to the Indonesian and Hawaii plans. 
Beyond Pesiticides. May 17 2023 Oxitec withdrew its application to release of billions 
of genetically engineered mosquitoes in California, according to a recent update from 
the California department of regulation: Journey 
Experimental Use permit. Spreading antibiotic resistance, ( caused by feeding 
canned chicken cat food which)  or make mosquito borne diseases worse by 
lowering individual immunity. Lack of proven results to date.Data from the Caymen 
Islands under a 2 year contract with Oxitec. Refused to renew the contract.  Proper 
risk assessments were never really done, risk assessments that met European 
standards: 
The legal requirement for the export of these mosquitoes were never published or 
consulted on.  
 
Efficacy data has not been publicly reifies  as regulators permit companies to 
maintain their internal data as confidential business information. 98% oxitec claim. 
What are the claims that the Yogyakarta  lab has made and have they been publicly

Publicly  
 
The withdrawal from California is a major acknowledgement that the project is too 
ineffective and risky for public health, beyond pestidcides.  They can be managed by 
eliminating standing water and encouraging predators. The eggs can dry out but 
need water to hatch and their larvae stage, when they eat organic matter from 
stagnant water. Which sites would these eggs be positioned? 
 
They really need to know where the Wolbachia came from as so much can be 
’smuggled in with a bacteria’ 
 
Gene editing - genetic molecular scissors and guide that looks for a match along the 
genome. All very similar to cause cuts in the wrong place. Hundreds of cuts from this 
process so we’re making changes in un planned place. It’s the cellular mechanism 
that repairs it. Deletions, additions, scrambled genetic information. In the repair. 
Chromothripsis shatters the chromosome and it repairs and causes cancer. They put 
in  cows and goats, Serum house of mouse. SO when crispr cut, it grabbed antibiotic 
genes which caused resistance. Cause allergens and toxins. Could cause serious 
diseases and death. Gene editing equipment, you can use a gene gun and fire or 
smuggle it in with a bacteria. Or cloning, creates massive numbers of mutations.

The introduction of new genetic material could turn on a silent gene, a carcinogen. It 
could generate autoimmunity or supercharge the host. Once the Wolbachia was 
inserted and shown to block mosquitoes ability to carry dengue, the studies suggest 
that they stopped checking for or never checked for deletions, or any controlled 
observation of interactions with other organic materials.Scientists often pay attention 
until what they want occurs. The they typically ignore the  sequence of the genes 
changing or unexpected epigenetic effects. If the effect they want occurs, they will 
put it on the market. It is an extremely dangerous practice but it looks like it has 
happened in the research.  
 
In Risk Calculation 
Risk was calculated by combining the probability or likelihood of an event occurring 
(or not occurring) and the impact or consequences of that event occurring (or not 
occurring) hence we considered the likelihood of not achieving release and that the 
event will cause more harm, as well as the consequences if these events occurred.

September 30th Richard organized a zoom meeting ‘Mosquito Genetic Engineering 
as a Bioweapon’   
with 3 representatives of the Ministry for Health to put our minds at rest re the 

mosquito program, 3 from planning, 3 from CIA, and 3 from World Mosquito 
program, with Frances as key note speaker and our team.  The outcome was that no 
one knew about it and it was less than 6 weeks to the release date. The WMP when 
asked scientific, tourism, health questions by our team merely answered with 
information from their promotional material to respond. 
 
Frances Presentation Prepared: Shared on 29th September 2023  
Part One: 
Richard: 
The situation for Bali in one month’s time. Please pay attention as this is a very short 
window we have to veto the plan on biosecurity grounds.  
 
Point one: 
We called this meeting ‘Mosquito Genetic Engineering as a Bioweapon’   
 
But these mosquitoes are not genetically engineered. The university must be really 
proud to have discovered a way to breed mosquitoes to carry this natural helpful 
bacteria Wolbachia, and continue to pass it down to future generations after release? 
I believe that is called a “gene drive” isn’t it? As far as I know, this is the first time a 
gene drive has been permitted outside a laboratory. I think that is testament to what 
has been achieved, as you must have completed many risk assessments and met 
extremely high safety standards to be given that permit. Can you tell us a bit about 
what risk assessments were done, in relation to human health and the environment. 
What plans are in place to mitigate the risks, and who is accountable if something 
should go wrong and these mosquitoes with enhanced immune systems become an 
invasive species themselves or there is contamination caused, in the short, medium 
or longterm. 
 
Frances, would you like to explain your understanding of Gene Drives in a 
bioweapons context. 
 
Gene drives are categorised as “dual use research of concern’ DURC, so they must 
be reviewed and assessed by the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) before any 
outdoor release. Research that is of Dual Use of Concern means that the research is 
proposed and justified by a civilian or health benefit initiative but facilities are mainly 
funded by the military, or corporate interests and the results therefore can be with-
held (not disclosed), on the grounds of biosafety or intellectual property rights.  
(Disclosure of sequences within COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutics patents) Patent 
Landscape Report by WIPO World Intellectual Property Organization 2023)  In this 
case of Wolbachia-Infected eggs proposed for Bali, there is someone who owns the 
Intellectual Property rights of this exact Wolbachia strain, used in Yogyakarta. We 
need transparency as to who that is, how the bacteria was isolated, and confirmation 
that there were no other changes made before its patent. Indeed, in the World 
Mosquito Program’s own report on how they plan to Scale-Up the production of 
these mosquitoes, the only legal issue they name, is the use of the Wolbachia IP 
(Intellectual Property) that WMP use. It is widely understood that one of the several 
methods of gene-editing, is to ‘smuggle a genetic trait in on a bacteria’.  If the active 
ingredients or genetic sequence is not in the public domain, there will be not even be 
a way for Bali’s water quality board and Environmental Protection Agency to use it as 
a parameter to check its levels before and after the mosquito’s release.   

 
The Institutional Biosafety Committee or DARPA or any other national security body, 
(and one would have thought CDC Centre for Disease Control who have dedicated 
funding to the research), will require a meaningful risk assessment and independent 
safety testing.  
Exemption 
The WMP asked for and received an exemption from doing a risk assessment and 
instead used advanced modelling, using Artificial Intelligence, belonging to Microsoft. 
Modelling was used to assess the 50 or so hazards that could be posed and found 
them all to be negligible (Negligible means no cause for concern, very low risk). They 
also used this Artificial Intelligence to decide where to position the mosquito eggs, for 
maximum effect - They used this in Yogyakarta for the release in the city and now, 
they are planned for north, south, east and west Denpasa, and sites in the North of 
Bali. A court would be able to assess if there was a conflict of interests in using a 
technology owned by the main proponent of the research, to authorise its 
certification as safe, its feasibility and its exact rollout. Even if there are no conflict of 
interests or financial interests, it does not inspire confidence in the population of Bali 
- or anywhere else - for one infant technology: Gene Drives to be governed by 
another infant technology: Artificial Intelligence, when our environment and its 
trillions of microbial interactions that provide our atmosphere, soil, food, water, and 
including our microbiome - blood, digestion, skin, immune systems, which are the 
results of 360 billion years of evolution, are at stake. Which body, and named 
responsible person, would be liable for the downstream affects of this research?  
 
Bioweapons are potentially more deadly than nuclear weapons and were 
internationally recognized as a weapon of mass destruction, in the 1972 Biological 
Weapons Convention   
 
Gene drives modify and generate microorganisms, aiming to promote particular 
traits, in this case Wolbachia. The reason open air release of gene drives has 
remained prohibited is that accidental release of a novel species or pathogen could 
have far reaching environmental, health, social, and economic consequences but 
there is also the risk of the intentional misuse. Gene drives are much more 
dangerous even than the genetically engineered mosquitoes released by Oxitec. 
People may know that Oxitec’s genetically engineered mosquitoes were gene edited 
to have a fluorescent gene added so that they could be monitored. They were edited 
to include ‘a limiting gene’  so the new species would die off. They were edited so 
that female mosquitoes had deformed mouths so they couldn’t bite and to ensure 
that females could not reach maturity and breed. Also the males were given an 
aggressive trait, so that they would kill wild mosquitoes. However inaccurate and 
dtysfunctioning this engineering was, at least they could monitor and the novel 
species would die off.  
 
Very differently, gene drives introduce a vast quantity of a new species into nature 
(Aedes Egypti permanently infected with Wolbachia bacteria, in this case), a species 
for which there is no existing evolutionary niche. What is so dangerous is that the 
micro-organism, Wolbachia Bacteria, and its host, the Aedes Egypt Mosquito, have 
been given a genetic advantage: Every surviving mosquito offspring from either the 
distributed eggs or future breeding with wild mosquitoes, will express the new 
genetic sequence, including the Wolbachia Bacteria. The bacteria boosts the 

immune system of the mosquito. While, unacceptably, mosquito bites weaken the 
human immune system (Frontiers published peer-reviewed research in 2022 stated 
“components in mosquito saliva weaken the antiviral immune response of the host, 
permitting easier entry and replication of viruses in the host.” This was an article 
exploring how delivering vaccines  
(https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2022.1024559/full#:~:text=Mosqui
to%20saliva%20components%20reduce%20the,host%20(94–96).) at the site of a 
bite would be most effective - but we will come back to that. 
 
The Aarhus Convention is one legal instrument that could be used as to block this 
release. “The Aarhus Convention grants the public rights regarding access to 
information, public participation and access to justice, in governmental decision-
making processes on matters concerning the local, national and transboundary 
environment. It focuses on interactions between the public and public authorities.” 
 
Thank you everyone, can we ask the experts to say more about the functions of 
Wolbachia Bacteria or to respond to my concerns.   
 
 
Richard,  
The Wolbachia bacteria has been shown to have a mechanism that functions as an 
antiviral, competing with the pathogens like Dengue, and indirectly prevent 
mosquitoes from transmitting those diseases to us.  
Was Wolbachia bacteria chosen for any other functions?  
Wolbachia bacteria is also attributed a genetic trait called “cytoplasmic 
incompatibility”, which means that only offspring that are infected with the bacteria 
will survive.  Could you explain this in layman’s terms and explain if that was just 
crucial  for the creation of the gene drive or if the public could hope for a reduction in 
the mosquito population?  
 
Frances’ Presentation Part 2 
 
Frances, what made you raise the alarm that Wolbachia Bacteria might be suitable 
for use as a bioweapon? 
 “The NATO definition of a biological agent is: A microorganism (or a toxin derived 
from it) which causes disease in man, plants or animals or which causes the 
deterioration of material.” They include Bacteria, Viruses, Rickettsiae, Chlamydia, 
Parasites, Fungi and Toxins.”   
 
In the scenario of a release, we have all of these. The host mosquitoes rely on 
human blood for reproduction. THey will carry bacteria and viruses. The Wolbachia 
was found to be already present in the human body, in our parasites, specifically the 
common round worm and its thread worms, :The filariae are thread-like parasitic 
nematodes (roundworms) that are transmitted by arthropod vectors” (mosquitoes).  
Taylor’s research “Wolbachia in the inflammatory pathogenesis of human filariasis” 
concluded 
“Filarial nematodes cause some of the most debilitating diseases in tropical 
medicine. Recent studies, however, have implicated the parasites' endosymbiotic 
Wolbachia bacteria, rather than the nematode, as the cause of inflammatory-
mediated filarial disease.” 

  
Furthermore, there is a drug Doxycycline which is “effective on Wolbachia, and 
subsequently on the worm's fertility but not on the worm itself. In 2001, it was shown 
that the adverse reactions observed after treatment may be caused by the release of 
Wolbachia from destroyed worms. These bacteria manipulate the fertility of their 
host”. As all species host parasites that host Wolbachia, it would be impossible to 
test the countless interactions like digestion, infection, horizontal gene transfer, 
adaptations, mutations and transmissions, through bites, water courses, or 
ecological collapse which could lead to a disease-ridden population.  
 
There would be no means of diagnosing which pathogen is responsible, in which 
case.  
 
The host mosquitoes are parasites, and will carry bacteria and viruses. The 
Wolbachia was found to be already present in the human body, in our parasites, 
specifically the common round worm and its thread worms, :The filariae are thread-
like parasitic nematodes (roundworms) that are transmitted by arthropod vectors” 
(mosquitoes).  Taylor’s research “Wolbachia in the inflammatory pathogenesis of 
human filariasis” concluded 
“Filarial nematodes cause some of the most debilitating diseases in tropical 
medicine. Recent studies, however, have implicated the parasites' endosymbiotic 
Wolbachia bacteria, rather than the nematode, as the cause of inflammatory-
mediated filarial disease.” 
 
NATO goes on citing “Mass production: a bioweapon needs to be produced at scale 
without the loss of pathogenicity Making microorganisms effective as self-
propagating. Effective delivery: a biological agent typically needs to be deployed 
quickly and en masse to achieve its maximum impact before effective 
countermeasures can be deployed. Environmentally robust: a biological agent needs 
to be able to survive in the environment and spread. A gene drive meets all those 
criteria. 
  
Population 
No less serious is the common knowledge that people develop an intolerance. If they 
receive a large amounts of stings or bites. It triggers an immune system response to 
the toxins and an ongoing sensitivity. 
 
Eggs 
She also highlighted the risks of unintentional migration, the involvement of the 
military governing body Darpa. 
What proves this is a completely unacceptable level of risk is the research that 
shows diseases are passed down to the eggs too. 
The frequency and timing of egg release was important to the transmission of 
malaria infection into the egg but consider how mosquitoes produce on average 100 
eggs three times in their 2 weeks’ life expectancy. The eggs must be in water. Then 
consider how the mosquito spends a further two weeks in the water after hatching, 
feeding on organic matter and eating and being eaten by other species. Although 
some studies claim that wolbachia is not present in fish or birds or humans, the VCA 
Animal Hospital confirm that the same roundworms which host wolbachia are found 
in birds and the ‘Common Marine Parasites’ article for the Conservation Government 

publication confirms that many parasites including the roundworms are found in most 
fish.  Dissemination includes inhalation, dermal exposure and ingestion 
 
Bill Gates Funding and Agenda: 
Does it sound incredible and just plain wrong when it is suggested that the The Bill 
and Melinda Gates Foundation might want to deliver mass vaccination using 
mosquitoes? Does it sound extreme to consider that the Indonesian Universities 
might have been chosen to receive funding so that the amazing scientific 
breakthroughs would be a cause for national pride and trust, helping to manufacture 
consent from the population to accept a massive and continued release of biting and 
breeding mosquitoes?    
 
The experts can say what they want. 
 
Frances, Do you think these stories have any credibility and basis in fact? Who could 
benefit from conducting a biological attack and how?

When I heard that University had been working on this research since 2004, I was 
briefly reassured. But then I discovered that in 2003, just the year before, The Gates 
Foundation had released a mission statement:  
 
14 Grand Challenges in Global Health and identified Indonesia as a recipient for 
generous funding. 
3. Develop needle-free delivery systems for vaccines. 
Control insects that transmit agents of disease: 
7. Develop a genetic strategy to deplete or incapacitate a disease-transmitting insect 
population. 
Measure disease and health status accurately and economically in developing 
countries: (Health Certification) 
13. Develop technologies that permit quantitative assessment of population health 
status: (The power to declare another pandemic and how we should respond. 
14. Develop technologies that allow assessment of individuals for multiple conditions 
or 
pathogens at point-of-care: Restrict where we are allowed to be and allowed to go. 
The people of Bali are already being fed a new narrative that tells us that mosquitoes 
feed between 6am and 8am and then in the evening between 4pm and 8pm. This 
could be the parameters for a new curfew.  
 
Here in 2023, the World Health Organization have proposed world-wide rules for 
responding to a pandemic, and amendments to the International Health Regulations 
which would give the WHO themselves the power to both declare a pandemic and 
also override individual nations in deciding how to respond to the declared. 
emergency. It would be naive to overlook recent statements by the WHO in relation 
to mosquitoes. One statement said that “the migration of mosquitoes” due to climate 
change may require a vaccine program to deal with mosquito-borne diseases. There 
will be no unintentional migration of mosquitoes, as they only move a few hundred 
metres maximum in their lifespan. The WHO are preparing the public for a huge 
increase in mosquitoes, and a vaccine program.  
 

A Maryland University recently studied how quickly malaria antibodies established in 
a human study which, they said, “we generated by using mosquitoes exposed to a 
malaria-causing parasite”. They said they did not plan mass vaccination. 
 
So is the main point is that we need to make a choice while we can still make a 
choice. When the WHO is ratified - comes into effect they can authorise and 
mandate the use of any technology they choose, and call it a health measure that all 
countries must adopt. There has been very little resistance to the WHO’s 
Convention, maybe because pharmaceuticals are the strongest economy and 
industry right now.  
 
In the heading you used the word, nation, and we have this one opportunity to 
challenge the WHO by law.      
  
Come on Bali! You have been attacked before and what you decided to protect then 
was your paradise island, your royalty, your extraordinary wood carving, and your 
own traditional medicine, empowered by reverence and offerings to the gods. You 
know the importance of paying your respects, and every day offerings of Wai Chru 
are a priority for everyone. Are you going to disrespect everything that you live for, 
and everything that your public servants in government should be protecting, in 
reaction only to hurt pride that your universities and greatest minds have been 
exploited by the offer of funding. The coercion has led to creating a terrifying 
biological weapon, a plague of mosquitoes. As Dr Campbell and many others warn; 
in a few months the WHO will be deciding where this technology is deployed. Before 
the proposed amendments, the WHO need consent, because of people’s bodily 
integrity and from government states to buy and implement their health strategies. 
After the Amendments, WHO will implement a “rules-based order, and all countries 
will be legally bound to comply.  
 
The WHO’s own stance on the open air release of Gene Drives is that it should take 
place in STEPS. The steps they refer to are releasing them on islands before 
continents, to see what happens. There is no way to clean up a contamination of 
living microorganisms, unlike toxic chemical spills. The only way containment has 
been attempted is by burning an area to the ground and further. We do not have 
proof yet but there was a major release of mosquitoes started this year in Maui, with 
164 drone drops a week, and planned for 20 years. Four months after it started Maui 
was raised to the ground. In a more clear cut report, Sri Lanka welcomed 
mosquitoes to tackle disease in 2021 and in 2023 the news is “Multiplying dengue 
mosquito larvae raises risks for Colombo” Larvae live and feed in water. 
 
We do not have proof yet that this particular technology could destroy the 
environment of every one of the 17,000 Indonesian Islands. All we know is that it will 
be a torment the like of which has never been experienced before. 200 million 
mosquito eggs a year, each pair laying 300 eggs in their two weeks of life. Each 
female requiring a ‘blood meal’ to produce those eggs.  
 
The solution 
While we have a choice, we need to veto this release on security grounds and then 
use every precedence in law to stop other attacks. Universities need to use every 
enquiring scientific mind to raise awareness of how unpredictable and unsafe altered 

species are, how inaccurate these new technologies are, and what an unacceptable 
risk it would be to pollute the gene pool irreversibly and with it the environment we 
depend on. Every independent man and woman can contribute something. The 
government has not invited “comments from the public” let alone a planning process 
with a time period for “objections” to be made. The most powerful things we can do 
are serve “notice” on the university, on the WHO, The WMP, The Gate Foundation 
and on local government stating the risks that you understand them to be 
accountable for, by registered post and send a copy of your notice to the lawyer that 
we hope will take this case on. The solution I anticipate is that international law 
combined with the common sense and majority pressure, will lead to the 
disassembling of the World Health Organization and its sponsors and compensation 
demanded from their huge profits.  
 
To move from zero to hero, this Yogyakarta has to make a definitive U-turn and stop 
its ‘preparations in Denpasar’ with immediate effect.  
It is unclear what those preparations are.  
It remains unclear how “Wolbachia does what it does”.  
It is unclear why no risk assessment has been required yet. 
There is a plan to have a factory in Brazil for the mosquito eggs. These will carry all 
the infectious diseases that Brazil is facing too. 
With all that uncertainty, any further mosquito or mosquito egg release should be 
deemed to bring unacceptable and unjustifiable levels of risk. Is anyone else asking 
where does the blood come from? I mean, really? Blood banks? Volunteers? An 
industry byproduct?  
 
Stop and desist. Stop and correct. We need this research program to stop the 
release, break ties with the World Mosquito Program, to refuse further funding, be 
supported by the Indonesian government and the trusted men and women here to 
build a book of evidence, a Protected Disclosure, and claim compensation. There 
are other people here who know more about the disposal of Wolbachia, mosquito 
biomass and other biohazards in the laboratory. There are others here who have 
already confronted these issues in the European Parliament, in Law Courts and 
through independent research. They might explaining the progression of the World 
Health Organization and Health and social representatives. I look forward to hearing  
the questions you bring to our esteemed panel of experts and working with you all in 
a united way to turn this around and create better conditions, not worse.  
 
I have saved the best for last. Possibly the most relevant research I did on 
mosquitoes led me to a 2013 study in Sweden that proved that mosquito eggs carry 
the pathogens and drive new diseases. Separate, peer-reviewed studies looked at 
how Malaria is transmitted to eggs, how Dengue, how Ockelbo, how Zika and Yellow 
Fever are all present in Mosquito eggs.  Just imagine all those diseased eggs being 
distributed around populated areas. The pathogens won’t harm the mosquito, as the 
immune systems of the entire Aedes Aegypti species have been fortified by 
Wolbachia bacteria. There will be successful breeding, there will be no curb on 
biting. We won’t ever know whether we are suffering from Dengue; a developed 
intolerance to mosquitoes; allergic reactions from multiple bites;  anaphylactic shock; 
fever, rash, infection and if when we take an anti-biotic we get more seriously ill 
because Wolbachia has been released into our systems.  Doctors won’t be able to 
diagnose the trouble for our weakened immune systems, and no one will be 

accountable. Right from day one, the very pathogens we seek to reduce will pass 
into the water, into the soil, into the parasites of other species, including us.  Even 
studies on Wolbachia, the intended infection, showed how it entered water courses 
and caused health issues in humans, including Elephantiasis and river blindness. 
The risks were proved to be so great, that a mass release of mosquitoes was 
blocked there this year, so it can be done. If the scientists claim that the mosquitoes 
were trialed remember that that was adults, no eggs. In other countries the safety 
protocol is that mosquitoes must be more than 500 metres from a water course. 
While eggs and larva live in water. Also the trial in Yogyakarta found The report 
states there were less cases of Dengue after the release and, secondly, less severe 
cases of Dengue that needed hospitalisation. This is misleading as it suggests that 
the severe Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever is a severe case of Dengue but it is a distinct 
- and so-far very rare - strain of Dengue. The trial did not find that there were less 
mosquitoes. The trial did not ask what other diseases were present.  
 
The final word should come from the bioweapons publication: “Guidance Notes to 
the Field Commander on the Consequences of Individual Agents For Continued 
Operational Effectiveness. “A biological agent typically needs to be deployed quickly 
and en masse to achieve its maximum impact before effective countermeasures can 
be deployed.”  
This meeting is our counter measure as somebody for some reason wants those 
mosquito eggs deployed quickly with no notice to the receiving communities and no 
governance. 
 
Some articles have been saying that it is more financially economical to produce 
mosquitoes that produce a vaccine. That is not the choice we face. We don’t believe 
either is a genuine health strategy. We have the choice to recognise we the people 
are under attack and stand up for ourselves, using every human ability and all the 
energy we have.  
NATO’s summary maybe explains what those articles really meant when they wrote 
‘mosquito releases are an economical option’: “The purely financial advantage of 
employing biological weapons was clearly illustrated by a 1969 expert United 
Nations panel which estimated the cost of operations against civilian populations at 
$1/Km2 for biological weapons, versus $600/Km2 for chemical, $800/Km(2)2 for 
nuclear, and $2,000/Km2 for conventional armaments” FAS, 2021 (Full Analysis Set, 
Statistics).  
 
Thank you very much Richard for inviting me to speak and to everyone for listening.

3rd October 2024 
Document: Mosquito points with full references 
 
The people of Bali have been told to expect hundreds of millions of mosquitoes to be 
released as a natural solution to the spread of Dengue Fever.  
 
The Mayor posted on Instagram two weeks ago, that in November, the release 
would happen but it has already begun - with door to door presentation of mosquito 
eggs in cups, with instructions to look after them and report back on their health - the 
mosquitoes’ health. 
 
Gene Drive Technology 
The mosquitoes are not natural. They are a new gene drive technology which forces 
one bacteria (Wolbachia) through a whole species (Aedes Aegypti) where it was not 
present before. Gene Drives are classified as dangerous by military (bioweapons) 
and conservation groups (Irreversible contamination of the gene pool).  
Open air release of gene drives is prohibited and moratorium even on further 
research has been requested. This research nor the factories for mass production of 
the mosquitoes have declared that they are a gene drive.  
 
Safety Analysis 
Safety testing and risk analysis is impossible for micro organisms and organisms 
because they spread, unlike chemical contaminations. The spread is through  
1. Distribution: Intentional distribution of 200 million eggs on Bali per year 
2. Flying: Using a flying vector (mosquitoes) 
3. Breeding: The mosquitoes are produced to successfully breed. They lay 100 eggs, 
three times in their two weeks of adult life. 
4. Genetic advantage. The Wolbachia bacteria boosts their immune system (While 
receiving multiple mosquito bites weakens the human immune system) 
5. Water: Mosquito eggs and larvae live in water for two weeks and protocols in 
other countries state that mosquitoes should not be released within 500 metres of a 
water course.  
6. Spread through horizontal gene transfer, where another species, the water and 
soil all start to assimilate the mosquito biomass dead or alive in to their own genetic 
make up. 
 
The impossibility of risk analysis along with well documented disasters are how 
California were able to block the mass release of mosquitoes there this year, 
 
The World Mosquito Program has not carried out a risk assessment for Bali, for this 
release. They are using Artificial Intelligence modelling to do calculate bio hazard 
risks. They are using AI modelling to decide where to place the mosquitoes. The 
independent risk assessors are an arm of the World Health Organization whose 
health strategy this is. 
 
Each component, bacteria, toxin, mosquito, quick to transport and delivery covertly, 
fit the criteria to be used as a biological weapon, identified in international law as 
weapons of mass destruction. Since 1972 treaties have been in place to agree the 
non proliferation of biological weapons. In the present day context, the World 
Mosquito Program, sponsored by Bill Gates is launching 1) a disease vector. 2) A 

Gene Drive:  Dual Use Research of Concern (DURC), justified by health but funded 
and protected by military and corporate interests. They don’t need to disclose their 
findings on grounds of biosafety concerns or trade value. 3) A control mechanism by 
which other health measures can be delivered, including cures, lockdowns and 
needle-less vaccines. Which are all within the health strategy of the World Health 
Organization. 
 
Also in the next months, world-wide governments will be asked to enter into a legally 
binding agreement with the WHO, giving the WHO full responsibility for pandemic 
response. They will decide when to call a pandemic, what research to do to prepare 
for it, and what vaccines and other measures individual governments must buy, 
implement and mandate for its people. 
 
We should not be naive to the fact that this is also a provides a large market for the 
pharmaceutical products which the WHO’s sponsors produce. With experimental and 
emergency-use permits being granted by the same bodies, Indonesia has to make a 
choice while it still can. 
 
An injunction must be put in place with immediate effect, until liability is established 
for the 50 individual biohazards (the WPM themselves identified) and for the other 
unforeseeable damages to human and environmental health. Financial ability to 
insure and pay for loss of life, loss of earnings, loss of habitats, loss of tourism, loss 
of water quality and loss of quality of lif, with so many biting, breeding mosquitoes 
set to be released. 
 
There has been no public consultation or consent. There has been commitment to 
reduce the mosquito population and no explanation why the continued release is 
going to be done, when a gene drive takes only 2 generations to establish in a whole 
population - about one month. 
 
Finally and fatally, the eggs of mosquitoes carry the Dengue, Malaria, Zika and the 
Chique… diseases that the female mosquito carried, and her mother and her 
mother. It is also, therefore a drive of the diseases that the World Mosquito Program 
claims to reduce with this technology.  
 
The mass release of mosquitoes will introduce new diseases and drive new variants, 
as the eggs will be produced in other countries, with other strains. Perhaps why the 
Dengue Hemoragic Fever is mentioned. It is not a severe case of Dengue. It is a so-
far very rare and distinct strain.  
 
Indonesia as a whole demands that the mosquito release is stopped until further 
notice.

3rd October another document: Possible Legal Defence Strategy 
 Legal Strategy and Consent Issues 
 
Injunction: Postpone Immediately and Indefinitely  
Case to Stop The Release permanently  
Claim costs for court, harm done, wasted time and compensation, for real solutions 
to reducing pests and diseases. 
 
Injunction 
I would say we don’t need a future legal action, we need an immediate legal action.  
I think they would take the form of injunctions. 
The beauty of an injunction is that the hearing can take place without the defence 
being present - Being that the World Health Organization, or any of the invested 
parties.  A number of injunctions could be put in place, on grounds that Gene Drives 
are proven to be irreversible. And actually all engineered novel species carry a risk 
of persistence in nature and permanent contamination of the gene pool. 
 
Injunction to postpone the release naming the implementers and who they are 
representing. Each must have a named man or woman. 
 
Planning Office 
For example, the man Tak Nice sometimes acting as Planning Officer for Bali 
Government. 
The claim is the planning office has not done Due Diligence or Proper Process. Due 
Diligence is the impossibility of Risk Assessment of the release of living 
microorganisms, which are intended to spread. Proper process is public consultation, 
notification of the planning application and period of usually 6 weeks while objections 
are invited on the application, which is available to see in the planning office by any 
one and contains the maps and the risk assessments and duration and the 
organization accepting liability.  
 
Military - evidence finding. 
1. In Yogyakarta, the military came to ‘celebrate’ the distribution of the eggs. Have 
the Balinese military personnel been approached yet to ask if they will be present at 
the Bali release? Is it for the ceremony or is it to protect the egg releases, as it is 
known that they may not be wanted. 
 
2. Send them the papers of CIA and ask them to communicate with DARPA about 
the bio risks of gene drives. Have they made any special exemptions from the 
prohibiting of their open air release, and why. 
 

Have the priests and monks been consulted in relation to whether they understand 
the mass mosquito releases to be in alignment with what the gods intend or would 
support for Bali.   
 
Health Office 
The man, Tak Nice, sometimes acting as health advisor to the minister for the Bali 
Government 
The injunction could be failure to implement the Cautionary Principle or the Do No 
Harm Principle. Also the Constitutional Right to bodily integrity and the need for 
Informed Consent to be Obtained from every man, woman and child over 12,  
 
The Implementers 
For the same reasons as above. 
 
The factory producing these Bali-destined mosquitoes.  
To prevent them leaving the laboratory, until biosafety and biohazard liability has 
been established for their products. Name the managers and the funders. 
 
The World Mosquito Program 
The release of any more promotional material by World Mosquito Program while 
various violations stated above are investigated.  
 
The WHO - injunction on any decision or promotion of the WHO Treaty 
Injunction on any Gene Drive Releases - Mosquitoes or Ticks or Microorganisms  
 
Bali Control of Disease and Drug Safety Authority  
Bali’s Environmental Protection Agency 
 
No release on Bali for any gene drive, as per the protocols prohibiting gene drives 
due to their irreversibility. 
 
(We need to name one designated leader in the centre - maybe the one who made 
the ludicrous declaration about migrating mosquitoes due to climate change and the 
need for a vaccine to help!). And name one in the independent arm of the WHO who 
conducted the independent safety testing/risk analysis. 
It would be worth joining our legal action to some or several of the other cases 
against WHO, and Fauci (who funds all medical research in all funding and therefore 
screens all research proposals and doesn’t support ones that might expose 
unacceptable risks or bad practice.  
 
The Injunction should be on the adoption of their Amendments and include all Dr 
Campbell and multitude of other commentators on the WHO’s Pandemic Treaty - 
which puts them above individual governments in making health desicisions, from 
lock downs to mosquito releases to vaccines and mandates. And would be legally 
binding. The injunction would ask that votes/agreements/decisions on that would be 
postponed until all investigations into their recommendations for the last pandemic, 
and conflicts of interest. 
 
The Injunction should also be on gene drives, Gene editing, and any releases of 
mosquitoes, or ticks or needle-less vaccines (all spelt out in the Global Challenges of 

Bill Gates in 2003, the year before picking Indonesia to receive funding in 2004. 
 
Give evidence on the International Bioweapons Component for other Cases already 
happening.   
While distilling the information into a manageable Injunction request format, for all 
these players in the release- maybe due diligence and due process could be a 
common theme, keep the information to hand (references below) and I have the 
bioweapons paper as well. We need to build a solid case with others to get a 
moratorium on gene drive, gain of function and all so-called green technologies on 
the basis that the risks far outweigh any imagined benefits. 
 
In the presentation I prepared, I showed how the following elements have all been 
weaponised. I recorded a video of the presentation and I have the transcript if either 
wanted. 
 
Bioweapons: The EGGS when laid, already carry all the pathogens of the parents. 
As well as the Wolbachia having never been in the Aedes Aegypti before - a novel 
super charged species. The Dengue already used. The malaria - a vaccine already 
prepared. The mosquito organism, the patented Wolbachia, quick deployment, 
civilian indiscriminate casualties. There is only one way to stop a bio contamination 
and that is scorch an area. Connecting DARPA (military control of biosafety) to the 
Army that burnt Maui after the mosquito release there, it could be used as an 
example. 
  
A court would be able to decide if there was a conflict of interests in the use of the 
Main proponent funding the research, owning the AI that certified the technology as 
safe, and mapped its exact rollout, using models of their own design. 
 
A body of evidence that shows that the World Health Organization and Bill Gates 
foundation have always known - maybe the man who spoke at the EU Parliament 
would give evidence - John Martin. 
 
So there is a ‘mass murder with intent’, rather than an ‘unintentional migration’. 
 
For we the people 
In parallel, the Aarhus Convention could be invoked as an instrument to give the 
people of Bali a voice. Even the “Just Transition” can be used to show the damage 
done to the people. 
 
Gene Watch UK were central to the success in stopping the release in California this 
year.

5th October Documents on Individual Points  
 

Nano Technology and Genetic Modification 
There is a variety of risks of misuse of nanotechnology. I am not sure if I want to find 
out whether the mosquitoes have some sort of nano technology in them or not. It is 
common practice to include some sort of nano transmitter into agriculture sprays, for 
example because this allows companies to monitor the fertility of the soil. Of course 
there is also the obvious possibility that nano technology that can COLLECT data 
may be able to transmit information and even instructions TO the nano implant and 
its host. Some people here will know that people who received the Covid 19 gene 
therapies now have a bluetooth signal, that comes up as Unknown device, even on 
an ordinary phone. IP In this instance, the mosquitoes - with the natural tendencies 
of the wolbachia, could be designed to target women or people with O type blood, 
which does not contain antigens. There is already anecdotal evidence that 
mosquitoes affect women more than men.   
 
On the other hand, if the mosquitoes do not carry any nano technology, then I would 
worry how the research project intends to measure population increase or decrease 
and presence in the environment.    
 
Artificial Intelligence 
The World Mosquito Programme asked for and received an exemption from doing a 
risk assessment and instead used advanced modelling, using Artificial Intelligence, 
belonging to Microsoft. Modelling was used to assess the 50 or so hazards that 
could be posed and found them all to be negligible (Negligible means no cause for 
concern, very low risk).  
 
They also used this Artificial Intelligence to decide where to position the mosquito 
eggs, for maximum effect - They used this in Yogyakarta for the release in the city 
and now, they are planned for north, south, east and west Denpasar, and sites in the 
North of Bali. A court would be able to assess if there was a conflict of interests in 
using a technology owned by the main proponent of the research, to authorise its 
certification as safe, its feasibility and its exact rollout. Even if there are no conflict of 
interests or financial interests, it does not inspire confidence in the population of Bali 
- or anywhere else - for one infant technology: Gene Drives to be governed by 
another infant technology: Artificial Intelligence, when our environment and its 
trillions of microbial interactions that provide our atmosphere, soil, food, water, and 
including our microbiome - blood, digestion, skin, immune systems, which are the 
results of 360 billion years of evolution, are at stake. Which official authority and 
named responsible people, would be liable for the downstream affects of this 
research?  
 
There is the talk of Denpasar as a smart city already ad Bali as a smart island. As 
one man said that will invite a huge amount of surveillance technology onto the 
island. Supported by The Gate world health monitoring in the Global Challenges that 
he addressed, starting in 2003. One question that needs to be asked is if a city is to 
become SMART what is the plan for the original homes in the less equipped 
Denpasar we have now? 
 
Intellectual Property 
Intellectual property rights refer to the disclosure and publishing of genetic 
sequences created and studies related to them. They are inevitably linked to the 

possibility of independent testing, if they can remain private property.  This was the 
problem when they were categorised as a Dual  Use Research Concern 
 
(As I mentioned) In the World Mosquito Program’s wrote a report on how they would 
Scale-Up the production of the wolbachia mosquitoes, they name the use of the 
Wolbachia IP (which I thought was Intellectual Property rather than Internet Protocol) 
that WMP use as a legal issue. We need transparency as to who that is, how the 
bacteria was isolated, and confirmation that there were no other changes made 
before its patent. Indeed, in the World Mosquito Program’s own report on how they 
plan to Scale-Up the production of these mosquitoes, the ONLY legal issue they 
name, is the use of the Wolbachia IP (Intellectual Property) that they use. 
 
If I can just clarify that the university themselves have not been required to provide 
safety testing for an open air release and no one else is allowed the information to 
try one either.  
 
Putting this in the context of the World Health Organization changes in their 
Pandemic Treaty. No one will know and yet still measures like this will be given the 
go ahead without consent. 
 
Wolbachia 
 
The Wolbachia bacteria has been shown to have a mechanism that functions as an 
antiviral, competing with the pathogens like Dengue, and indirectly prevent 
mosquitoes from transmitting those diseases to us.  
I want to ask afterward whether Walbachia bacteria was chosen just for this reason 
or for any other functions?  
 
Wolbachia bacteria is also attributed a genetic trait called “cytoplasmic 
incompatibility”, which means that only offspring that are infected with the bacteria 
will survive.  Could you explain this in layman’s terms and explain if that was just 
crucial  for the creation of the gene drive - in that only infected mosquito eggs will 
hatch - or if the public can hope for a reduction in the mosquito population?  
 
What made me raise the alarm that Wolbachia Bacteria might be suitable for use as 
a bioweapon? 
 “The NATO definition of a biological agent is: A microorganism (or a toxin derived 
from it) which causes disease in man, plants or animals or which causes the 
deterioration of material.” They include Bacteria, Viruses, Rickettsiae, Chlamydia, 
Parasites, Fungi and Toxins.”   
 
In the scenario of a release, we have all of these. The host mosquitoes rely on 
human blood for reproduction. They will carry bacteria and viruses. The Wolbachia 
was found to be already present in the human body, in our parasites, specifically the 
common round worm and its thread worms, :The filariae are thread-like parasitic 
nematodes (roundworms) that are transmitted by arthropod vectors” (mosquitoes).  
Taylor’s research “Wolbachia in the inflammatory pathogenesis of human filariasis” 
concluded 
“Filarial nematodes cause some of the most debilitating diseases in tropical 
medicine. Recent studies, however, have implicated the parasites' endosymbiotic 

Wolbachia bacteria, rather than the nematode, as the cause of inflammatory-
mediated filarial disease.” 
  
Furthermore, there is a drug Doxycycline which is “effective on Wolbachia, and 
subsequently on the worm's fertility in the human body but not on the worm itself. In 
2001, it was shown that the adverse reactions observed after treatment may be 
caused by the release of Wolbachia from destroyed worms.  
 
Furthermore, Wobachia bacteria manipulate the fertility of their host”. All species 
host the parasites that host Wolbachia bacteria. It would be impossible to test the 
countless interactions like digestion, infection, horizontal gene transfer, adaptations, 
mutations and transmissions, through bites, water courses, or ecological collapse 
which could lead to a disease-ridden population.  
 
There would be no means of diagnosing which pathogen is responsible, in which 
case and it would be as likely to be caused by the Wolbachia bacteria as any of the 
other pathogens. 
 
Population Control 
What has been produced in Yogyakarta laboratory is a huge scale, epigenetic, non 
native and could be argued NOVEL species which is set to be a highly invasive 
species.  The WPM say no need to reduce the population, the plan is to erase as 
many viable male and female eggs, to drive the dengue-resistant Wolbachia 
infection through the whole Aedes Aegypti mosquito population. 
 
What else do we know. 200 million more eggs per year hatching, a large percentage 
of them female (also achieved by the Wolbachia infection) So a large proportion of 
them going on to bite and breed themselves. It will be a plague and already the 
report from Sri Lanka.  
 
Colombo, Sri Lanka welcomed mosquitoes to tackle disease in 2021 and in 2023 the 
news is “Multiplying dengue mosquito larvae raises risks for Colombo”  
 
No less serious is the common knowledge that people develop an intolerance. If they 
receive a large amounts of stings or bites. It triggers an immune system response to 
the toxins and an ongoing sensitivity. We already have a lot of auto immune issues. 
This is a particular risk maybe to people from Bali who have enjoyed a high level of 
tolerance to mosquito stings so far. And also to women, and O type. 
 
Bio-Security 
(If I haven’t said it already under funding) The bioweapons publication: “Guidance 
Notes to the Field Commander on the Consequences of Individual Agents For 
Continued Operational Effectiveness. The purely financial advantage of employing 
biological weapons was clearly illustrated by a 1969 expert United Nations panel 
which estimated the cost of operations against civilian populations at $1/Km2 for 
biological weapons, versus $600/Km2 for chemical, $800/Km(2)2 for nuclear, and 
$2,000/Km2 for conventional armaments” FAS, 2021 
 
Bioweapons are potentially more deadly than nuclear weapons and were 
internationally recognized as a weapon of mass destruction, in the 1972 Biological 

Weapons Convention. NATO cites mass production in its criteria for use as a 
weapon.  “Mass production: a bioweapon needs to be produced at scale without the 
loss of pathogenicity,  Making microorganisms effective as self-propagating. 
Effective delivery: a biological agent typically needs to be deployed quickly and en 
masse to achieve its maximum impact before effective countermeasures can be 
deployed. Environmentally robust: a biological agent needs to be able to survive in 
the environment and spread. A gene drive meets all those criteria. 
 
“A biological agent typically needs to be deployed quickly and en masse to achieve 
its maximum impact before effective countermeasures can be deployed.”  
This meeting is our counter measure as somebody for some reason wants those 
mosquito eggs deployed quickly with no notice to the receiving communities and no 
governance.  
 
The solution 
While we have a choice, we need to veto this release on security grounds before the 
World Health Organization supercedes our power to stop it, with its ‘Pandemic 
Treaty’. 
 
Legal Defence 
Legal Strategy and Consent Issues 
I would say we don’t need a future legal action, we need an immediate legal action. I 
think this would take the form of an injunction 
The beauty of an injunction is that the hearing can take place without the defence 
being present - Being that the World Health Organization, or any of the invested 
parties.  A number of injunctions could be put in place, on grounds that Gene Drives 
are proven to be irreversible. And actually all engineered novel species carry a risk 
of persistence in nature and permanent contamination of the gene pool. 
 
Then the existing bioweapon conventions and treaties could be used. 
 
A court would be able to decide if there was conflict of interests in the use of the AI. 
 
The body of evidence that shows that the World Health Organization and Bill Gates 
foundation have always known.  
So there is a ‘mass murder with intent’, rather than an ‘unintentional migration’. 
 
In parallel, the Aarhus Convention could be invoked as an instrument to give the 
people of Bali a voice. Even the “Just Transition” can be used to show the damage 
done to the people, in shift to a ‘green economy’ but then the climate agenda also 
needs to be challenged. 
 
Gene Watch: Moratorium on Gene Drive Research let alone release in open air: 
350,000 signed petition  
 
Risk Assessment 
The way California was able to block the mass mosquito release was by arguing that 
the risk assessments and safety testing were beyond our capabilities. Tests were 
composed for chemical testing not living organisms, plus the gene editing contingent 
hide behind a reputation that gene editing is safe, predictable and effective. When it 

is not. Also, as could have happened in this case, proponents of genetic engineering 
and new technologies like this argue that these are all natural components and so 
the species ‘Could have happened in nature’ They couldn’t as Dr Latham in London 
clarifies well,  
 
The Institutional Biosafety Committee or DARPA or any other national security body, 
(and one would have thought CDC Centre for Disease Control who have dedicated 
funding to the research), will require a meaningful risk assessment and independent 
safety testing.  
 
There is no way to clean up a contamination of living microorganisms 
 
We do not have proof yet that this particular technology could destroy the 
environment of every one of the 17,000 Indonesian Islands. There is plenty of 
evidence of bio leaks and bio hazards that could have even destroyed all plant life, 
even though well meant,  All we know is that it will be a torment the like of which has 
never been experienced before. 200 million mosquito eggs a year, each pair laying 
300 eggs in their two weeks of life. Each female requiring a ‘blood meal’ to produce 
those eggs.  
 
Biohazards. 
The eggs, the larvae, the mosquitoes themselves, alive or as biomass. The water, 
the mechanisms of bacteria in a new context. Maybe the scientists can list the 50 or 
so they found and discuss their findings. None of these were mentioned in the 
WHO’s AI-contrived Risk Assessment for WMP. 
 
Vector or Vaccine 
Some articles have been saying that it is more financially economical to produce 
mosquitoes that produce a vaccine. That is not the choice we face. We don’t believe 
either is a genuine health strategy. We have the choice to recognise we the people 
are under attack and stand up for ourselves, using every human ability and all the 
energy we have.  
Misrepresentation of bioweapon deployment: 
“We need to vaccinate”.  
“They are migrating” 
“Research into delivering vaccines to the vulnerable mosquito bite site” 
  
Funding 
Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation premeditated violence against humanity using 
mosquitoes. After Microsoft was sued for monopoly practices, money laundered 
through vaccines and deployed as philanthropy. Indonesian Universities might have 
been chosen to receive funding so that the amazing scientific breakthroughs would 
be a cause for national pride and trust, helping to manufacture consent from the 
population to accept  a massive and continued release of biting and breeding 
mosquitoes?    
Who benefits from conducting a biological attack and how? 
 
Money siphoned through separate Indonesian Universities for Mosquitoes, Smart 
Cities etc keeping each study apparently distinct.  
When I heard that University had been working on this research since 2004, I was 

briefly reassured. But then I discovered that in 2003, just the year before, The Gates 
Foundation had released a mission statement:  
 
14 Grand Challenges in Global Health and identified Indonesia as a recipient for 
generous funding. 
3. Develop needle-free delivery systems for vaccines. 
Control insects that transmit agents of disease: 
7. Develop a genetic strategy to deplete or incapacitate a disease-transmitting insect 
population. 
Measure disease and health status accurately and economically in developing 
countries: (Health Certification) 
13. Develop technologies that permit quantitative assessment of population health 
status:  (The power to declare another pandemic and how we should respond. 
14. Develop technologies that allow assessment of individuals for multiple conditions 
or 
pathogens at point-of-care: Restrict where we are allowed to be and allowed to go. 
The people of Bali are already being fed a new narrative that tells us that mosquitoes 
feed between 6am and 8am and then in the evening between 4pm and 8pm. This 
could be the parameters for a new curfew.  
 
Here in 2023, the World Health Organization have proposed a world-wide business 
plan for responding to a pandemic, and amendments to the International Health 
Regulations which would give the WHO themselves the power to both declare a 
pandemic and also override individual nations in deciding how to respond to the 
declared. emergency. It would be naive to overlook recent statements by the WHO in 
relation to mosquitoes. One statement said that “the migration of mosquitoes” due to 
climate change may require a vaccine program to deal with mosquito-borne 
diseases. There will be no unintentional migration of mosquitoes, as they only move 
a few hundred metres maximum in their lifespan. The WHO are preparing the public 
for a huge increase in mosquitoes, and a vaccine program.  
 
Other Bioweapon research currently funded: 
A Maryland University recently studied how quickly malaria antibodies established in 
a human study which, they said, “we generated by using mosquitoes exposed to a 
malaria-causing parasite”. They said they did not plan mass vaccination (and yet 
African nations have since been injected with these live GMO-Malaria-Causing-
Parasites en masse - PDF Presentation to Lawyers and Ministers in Africa to help 
stop the roll-out. 
 
When the WHO is ratified - comes into effect they can authorise and mandate the 
use of any technology they choose, and call it a health measure that all countries 
must adopt. There has been very little resistance to the WHO’s Convention, maybe 
because pharmaceuticals are the strongest economy and industry right now. And 
large proportion of funding is controlling the narrative promoting their use.  
 
The WHO’s own stance on the open air release of Gene Drives is that it should take 
place in STEPS. The steps they refer to are releasing them on islands before 
continents, to see what happens. There is no way to clean up a contamination of 
living microorganisms, unlike toxic chemical spills. The only way containment has 
been attempted is by burning an area to the ground and further. We do not have 

proof yet but there was a major release of mosquitoes started this year in Maui, with 
164 drone drops a week, and planned for 20 years. Four months after it started Maui 
was raised to the ground. 
 
Some articles have been saying that it is more financially economical to produce 
mosquitoes that produce a vaccine. That is not the choice we face. We don’t believe 
either is a genuine health strategy. We have the choice to recognise we the people 
are under attack and stand up for ourselves, using every human ability and all the 
energy we have.  
NATO’s summary maybe explains what those articles really meant when they wrote 
‘mosquito releases are an economical option’: “The purely financial advantage of 
employing biological weapons was clearly illustrated by a 1969 expert United 
Nations panel which estimated the cost of operations against civilian populations at 
$1/Km2 for biological weapons, versus $600/Km2 for chemical, $800/Km(2)2 for 
nuclear, and $2,000/Km2 for conventional armaments” FAS, 2021 (Full Analysis Set, 
Statistics).  
 

The Aarhus Convention is one legal instrument that could be used as to block this 
release. “The Aarhus Convention grants the public rights regarding access to 
information, public participation and access to justice, in governmental decision-
making processes on matters concerning the local, national and transboundary 
environment. It focuses on interactions between the public and public authorities.” 
 
While we have a choice, we need to veto this plan, or put it on permanent hold 
pending an independent investigation, and then use every precedence in law to stop 
other attacks. Universities need to use every enquiring scientific mind to research the 
risks of gene editing, genetic engineering and call out the promoters who would say 
that it is accurate, safe and effective. There is always damage to the organism or 
microorganism and unexpected mutations arise on target and off target as the 
genome tries to repair itself.  At least one module in the biosciences should be 
dedicated to the ethics and difficulty in assessing modified organisms. At the 
moment, laboratories only look for successes and do not revisit what happened to 
the many thousands of attempts that did not work, and sometimes, do not pay 
attention to their disposal either. We can raise awareness of how unpredictable and 
unsafe altered and novel species are; how inaccurate these new technologies are, 
and what an unacceptable risk it would be to pollute the gene pool irreversibly and 
with it the environment we depend on.  
 
Every independent man and woman can contribute something. The government has 
not invited “comments from the public” let alone a planning process with a time 
period for “objections” to be made. The most powerful things we can do are serve 
“notice” on the university, on the WHO, The WMP, The Gate Foundation and on 
local government stating the risks that you understand them to be accountable for, 
by registered post and send a copy of your notice to the lawyer that we hope will 
take this case on. The solution I anticipate is that international law combined with the 
common sense and majority pressure, will lead to the disassembling of the World 
Health Organization and its sponsors and compensation demanded from their huge 
profits, for wasted time and high risks, if not proven actual crime against humanity. 
 
The WHO’s own stance on the open air release of Gene Drives is that it should take 
place in STEPS. The steps they refer to are releasing them on islands before 
continents, to see what happens. There is no way to clean up a contamination of 
living microorganisms, unlike toxic chemical spills. The only way containment has 
been attempted is by burning an area to the ground and further. We do not have 
proof yet but there was a major release of mosquitoes started this year in Maui, with 
164 drone drops a week, and planned for 20 years. Four months after it started, 
Maui was raised to the ground. 
 
Eggs to bypass regulation 
Possibly the most relevant research I did on mosquitoes led me to a 2013 study in 
Sweden that proved that mosquito eggs carry the pathogens and drive new 
diseases. Separate, peer-reviewed studies looked at how Malaria is transmitted to 
eggs, how Dengue, how Ockelbo, how Zika and Yellow Fever are all present in 
Mosquito eggs.  
 
Just imagine so many already-diseased eggs being distributed around populated 
areas. The pathogens won’t harm the mosquito, as the immune systems of the entire 

Aedes Aegypti species have been fortified by Wolbachia bacteria. There will be 
successful breeding, there will be no curb on biting. We won’t ever know whether we 
are suffering from Dengue; a developed intolerance to mosquitoes; allergic reactions 
from multiple bites;  anaphylactic shock; fever, rash, infection and if when we take an 
anti-biotic we get more seriously ill because Wolbachia has been released into our 
systems.  Doctors won’t be able to diagnose the trouble for our weakened immune 
systems, and no one will be accountable. Right from day one, the very pathogens we 
seek to reduce will pass into the water, into the soil, into the parasites of other 
species, including us.   
 
Even studies on Wolbachia, the intended infection, showed how it entered water 
courses and caused health issues in humans, including Elephantiasis and river 
blindness. The risks were proved to be so great, that a mass release of mosquitoes 
was blocked there this year, so it can be done. If the scientists claim that the 
mosquitoes were trialled  remember that that was adults, no eggs. In other countries 
the safety protocol is that mosquitoes must be more than 500 metres from a water 
course. While eggs and larva live in water. Also the trial in Yogyakarta found The 
report states there were less cases of Dengue after the release and, secondly, less 
severe cases of Dengue that needed hospitalisation. This is misleading as it 
suggests that the severe Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever is a severe case of Dengue but 
it is a distinct - and so-far very rare - strain of Dengue. The trial did not find that there 
were less mosquitoes. The trial did not ask what other diseases were present.  
 
The World Health Organization published some fear-mongering nonsense about the 
migration of mosquitoes due to climate change and the need for a new world vaccine 
to tackle the diseases they’re going to spread. At least this would be unintentional 
migration. But that is impossible as Aedes Aegypti only travel a maximum of 300 
metres in their lifespan. And other mosquitoes travel a maximum of 3km.  
 
The reason DARPA are attentively involved - they are the military governing body for 
genetic experiments and innovations, is that there is a high risk of INTENTIONAL 
migration of mosquitoes. What we have created in Indonesia, by producing mosquito 
eggs is a much increased shelf life for selling and exporting mosquitoes. An adult 
mosquito lives two weeks. The eggs can be stored for 8 months, dry, and then just 
add water to hatch. The eggs must be in water. Then the larvae lives in water for 
another two weeks, after hatching, feeding on organic matter and eating and being 
eaten by other species.  
 
What proves this is a completely unacceptable level of risk is the research that 
shows diseases are passed down to the eggs too. 
 
Malaria: The frequency and timing of egg release was important to the transmission 
of malaria infection into the egg but consider how mosquitoes produce on average 
100 eggs three times in their 2 weeks’ life expectancy.  
Dengue 
Although some studies claim that wolbachia is not present in fish or birds or humans, 
the VCA Animal Hospital confirm that the same roundworms which host wolbachia 
are found in birds and the ‘Common Marine Parasites’ article for the Conservation 
Government publication confirms that many parasites including the roundworms are 
found in most fish.  Dissemination includes inhalation, dermal exposure and 

ingestion 
 
Yogyakarta has to make a definitive U-turn and stop its ‘preparations in Depansa’ 
with immediate effect.  
It is unclear what those preparations are.  
It remains unclear how “Wolbachia does what it does”.  
It is unclear why no risk assessment has been required yet. 
There is a plan to have a factory in Brazil for the mosquito eggs. These will carry all 
the infectious diseases that Brazil is facing too. 
With all that uncertainty, any further mosquito egg production or release should be 
deemed to bring unacceptable and unjustifiable levels of risk.

banks? Volunteers? An industry byproduct?

Reports from other countries and rebuttal of Substantial Equivalence of GMO and 
Naturally-occurring  
We spent from the 5th to the 10th October researching the effects of mosquito 
release as a health strategy in other countries such as Florida, Texas, California, 
Brazil and Maui We discovered that there were more dangerous tropical diseases 
such as  Malaria in Florida and Texas, west Nile virus in Maryland U.S.A, Micro 
Encephalitis in Brazil and Dengue cases had doubled in Sri Lanka with a larvae 
crisis after their release. Bali had a 6-month release, Maui had a 20-year release 
program. This showed the randomness of the numbers of insects produced and 
released and the inefficacy of the strategy. 
No public consultation, consent or information passed to defense or planning 
departments. 
During this time Professor Richard Claproth and Tjok Gede visited the heads of the 
community in Bali and none of them had heard anything about the program. We 
spoke with a lot of tourists and the Expat community in Bali and none of them heard 
about this either. Proving the releases were un-constitutional.

I refer specifically to the products promoted at the AIS Technology Conference on 
the 10th and 11th October 2023, claiming to help climate action and the bio safety 
risks of a mRNA vaccine factory. We already need to consider how we will destroy 
the eggs safely without even one escaping. 
 
The Biotech Industry Lie that the World Mosquito Program are using:  
 
They claim that Gene Editing of microbes does not create Genetically Modify 
Organisms  
But any genetic engineering of microbes (whether that is to add IP Technology to 
Wolbachia bacteria, isolate a virus to create a mRNA vaccine, or to biodegrade 
plastic or anything are in fact hundreds of times more unpredictable and irreversible, 
and the techniques completely inaccurate and drive worse problems.

(the microorganism’s food supply) it dies off.

Enhance soil health - Steering the soil microbiome  
Soil Immunity: There is now a compulsory need to enhance the ability of soil per se 
to defend against invading pathogens (i.e. soil immunity). Soil immunity is normally 
attributed to the activities of the functional microbiome. In the meanwhile, pathogen-
microbiome interactions in soil are sensitive to soil contaminants which would filter 
out unique groups of microbial communities. Steering functional soil microbiome will 
not only limit disease development, but also reduce the level of soil pollution.

Human and Mosquito Population Control (1) 
Mosquitoes 
There is no intention to reduce mosquito populations in Bali 
“We no longer need to shorten the lifespan of the mosquitoes. If the mosquitoes live 
their regular lifespans, they have more time to breed and pass on the Wolbachia, 
which stops the virus from passing from mosquitoes to humans,” WMP said.”

Humans 
1998 Bill founded the Bill and Melinda Gates Institute for Population control  
   
2000 Two years later the United States sued Microsoft for Anti-trust violations 
monopolising the market. The District Court ordered a breakup of Microsoft as its 
remedy. 
 
2000 This same year Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation was founded 
 
2003 Gates releases his 14 Global Challenges including needle-less vaccines, AI 
surveillance and mosquito control methods.  
 
2004 Awarded open-ended funding to Yogyakarta to develop a mosquito for mass 
release. 

They managed to develop the most dangerous technology of all - a “gene-
drive”. World-wide, gene drives are banned from any open-air release. It is not just a 
risk that they will live and spread in nature. They are produced specifically to live and 
spread and these mosquitoes indeed have a gain of function: an immune system 
enhanced by the Wolbachia Bacteria to out-compete other  viruses.  
 
 
More terrifying again is that the WMP have received an exemption from safety 
testing, using a common argument for gene editing that because the materials are 
natural, then the new species “could have” happened in nature through breeding or 
evolution. “Substantial Equivalence” This is false. The researchers themselves said 
they used microinjections of Wolbachia thousands of times, into the ovaries and 
sperm of mosquito eggs before achieving genetic adaption to a permanent 
Wolbachia-infection that will be passed to every off-spring for all future generations. 
      
“Our method does not suppress mosquito populations or involve genetic modification 
(GM), as the genetic material of the mosquito is not altered,” WMP said. 
This is the absurd claim of Substantial Equivalence between GMO and naturally-
evolving organism and microorganisms. 
 
Intentional Confusing of Intellectual Property and Patent Laws (2) 
The World Mosquito Program released a Scale Up Report stating that the Wolbachia 
Bacteria 
used was protected as Intellectual Property. At the meeting they said the Wolbachia 
they used was completely natural and definitely not the same as found in other 
tropical diseases. 
This use of the Wolbachia IP was the only legal risk they foresaw in scaling up the 
mass release of new mosquitoes into Bali and importing and exporting them to 
twelve other countries.  
The deliberate confusion is the shortening of Intellectual Property to IP for years and 
now the shortening of Internet Protocol to IP, to obscure their inclusion of biotech 
surveillance in all products. 
 
During the pandemic Bill Gates lobbied governments, spending 8.3 million on this 
leverage. 
The Bill Gates Foundation then opposed the lifting intellectual property protections 
on the 
vaccines, even though they were publicly funded and the first drugs to go on the 
market 
without their active ingredients in the public domain - for independent testing. They 
are only 
tested by the companies that manufactured and sold them. 
 
If a research laboratory does not need to disclose the DNA sequences it has 
created, no one else can test those parameters or monitor them in the environment. 
This is particularly important in line with the definition of a vaccine. Which are the 
micro dose of the pathogen itself, sufficient to trigger an antibody response. 
 
National Security need to exercise the Freedom Of Information about the wolbachia 
IP. This will become important if there were new cases of disease in the population 
and we needed to establish if there was a connection to the Mosquito release. 

 
In 2010 Bill Gates claimed exclusive rights to computerising the human body. Patent: 
US-6754472-B1 - Method and apparatus for transmitting power and data using the 
human body | Unified Patents. 
 
In 2019 Bill Gates Bought shares in Biontech which became the Pfizer vaccine. 
Selling them two years later, he made a profit of 242 million dollars and announced 
publicly a week later that the vaccine did not work. 
 
Bill Gates has also committed huge donations of between 1.2 and 4 billion to Polio 
oral vaccines, in recent years. This is even though in 1972 before a Senate 
Committee hearing, Polio Inventor Jonas Salk testified that nearly all polio outbreaks 
since 1961 resulted from or were caused by the oral polio vaccine. 
 
This is the pattern of Bill Gates Philanthropy. He announces a crisis and then 
provides the antidote to it. As recently as last November 2022, Bill Gates issues a 
warning and forecast of a biological attack using Small Pox and then proposes the 
solution. Within two days the US government had bought up 113 million’s worth of 
OrthoPox vaccine from Siga Technology, whose reports described this as making for 
a 
good revenue base. 
 
The pattern is to create both the crisis, the cornered market and the vaccine and 
insist on the mandate. Small pox was a very telling choice of Bill Gates as there are 
only two high security laboratories in the United States that hold Small Pox, it is no 
longer present in nature. Therefore any re-emergence would have to be orchestrated 
and a connection made to laboratory who had managed to have a vaccine supply of 
that scale ready. The vaccine supplier had received a grant for 20 million in 2016 
and a patent was registered that year too.

now.

million breeding) and a pharmaceutical laboratory now, on national 
biosafety grounds.  
 
A mass release was stopped in Singapore and 
also in California, who demonstrated the impossibility of containment 
of a contamination, or predicting down-stream affects and 
irreversible damage. 
But also on efficacy grounds: The reports only claim ‘promising’ 
results where diseases ‘find it difficult’ to reproduce in Wolbachia- 
infected mosquitoes and the incidence of dengue ‘and other 
diseases’ is reduced. Furthermore, they say ‘it is not clear’ why the 
‘Wolbachia does what it does’. These are not quantifiable or 
qualifiable results. The percentages for success claimed in 

Yogyakarta cannot be proven.  
 
WMP claim that Bali is a different project, and the responsibility of the implementers. 
No one has said 
they will assume liability. Although Bill Gates’ Microsoft has said this 
month that 
“it will assume legal responsibility if they get sued for copyright infringement while 
using the 
company’s AI Copilot services”. 
This is the Artificial Intelligence used by the mosquito project to do 
the risk assessments, using modelling. And also their AI was used to 
map where the eggs should be distributed for maximum effect - they 
decided on recruiting people in their homes to adopt just a cup-full of 
mosquito eggs (but containing 500) and give responsibility to these 
home owners to report back on their progress. 
Medicines and drugs companies have been protected from liability 
since 1986 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Childhood_Vaccine_Injury_Act. 
By May 2024, the World Health Organization will self-appoint 
themselves as the authority on when to call a pandemic and which 
preparations to fund research and which responses governments 
must buy and implement, such as vaccines and boosters. Bill Gates 
was one of four non-government partners who decided the pandemic 
response to Covid, and he and Soros purchased the Covid Testing 
company. 
Indonesia will not stand a chance 
Microsoft has been sued in the past by the United States and the 
European Commission. Although these government bodies won, 
they lost again when Microsoft appealed the decisions and Microsoft 
have not complied with any of the courts’ remedies. 
 
There are three current lawsuits from the Philippines, Peruvia and 
India, with charges of pre-meditated murder by Bill Gates, following 
his vaccine rollout and adverse events.

The Eggs (4) 
 
2013 It was discovered that mosquito eggs carry the diseases that the health 
strategy are claiming to reduce. Mosquito eggs carry all the diseases that were 
present in the parents. And their parents. This will make the pathogens themselves, 
Dengue, Zika, Malaria and the others specific to where the new mosquitoes are 
being reproduced; epigenetic traits. A gene drive usually claims to drive one trait 
through all future off-spring through breeding - this was supposed, even by the 
researchers, to be just the harmless bacteria Wolbachia through every Aedes 
Aeqypti. But Wolbachia has been shown to be not harmless at all and completely 
unpredictable. Indeed it is associated with a new strain of Malaria. Malaria itself is a 
disease that hasn’t been a problem but has shown up 8 cases since Bill Gates’ 
release of mosquitoes in Florida and Texas. Another paper showed how Malaria was 

not just carried in the egg but transmissible by the hatched mosquitoes. The 
seriousness of distributing millions of eggs, that become larvae and must remain in 
water for two more weeks feeding (and being fed on) and then become breeding 
biting adults in any awareness that each carries diseases that are transmissible to 
humans, cannot be overstated. 
 
In Sri Lanka, the threat of Dengue has increased multiple times over since the mass 
release there two years ago. In the last two months articles confirmed being over-run 
with larvae. 
 
The scientists we have spoken to so far, even from the research in Yogyakarta, do 
not seem to be aware that these mosquitoes are a gene drive, let alone address or 
this catastrophe of or responsibility for releasing hundreds of millions of eggs which 
are infected with the diseases. 
 
2023 First release refused, in California, on inability to evaluate environmental 
damage and to human health by the release of a gene-edited organism - mosquito 
and micro-organism -Wolbachia bacteria, because they are living and spread 
through breeding, gene transfer andmutations to adapt, unlike .Female mosquitoes 
can transmit Zika virus to their eggs 
 
So many vested interests in biotech. And major power to implement his objectives 
without consent. 
Do not be concerned that Bill Gates has supported Indonesian research or there 
may be a financial obligation for the funding that has been received. 
“Microsoft’s $68.7 billion deal to acquire Activision Blizzard has been approved by 
EU regulators just weeks after UK regulators blocked the acquisition. The European 
Commission has concluded that the deal can pass thanks to commitments from 
Microsoft related to cloud gaming.”Compared to 2.4 million spent by Gates on a 
village on Bali, Damasaba, on tenuous grounds of need. 
 
Whatever it was for, and for however much, we are still in a position to veto the 
mosquito release as too dangerous and Bali as too small to manage, either the risk 
assessments necessary or financially redress any contamination. 
 
In terms of contamination, one must not be naive to the wider biotech solutions 
being. There will be pesticides to manage the mosquitoes where they are not 
wanted. 
Drones will socialised as an idea by using them monitor the spread in larvae in high-
rise buildings. There will be a vaccine offered for the Malaria and Dengue 
Hemorragic Fever. It might even be made mandatory or airborne or even to be 
delivered by new mosquitoes. There will be no way to diagnose symptoms from 
raised intolerance to multiple bites or mutations in the Wolbachia, or synergies 
developing between the pathogens and Wolbachia. Possibly, the contamination will 
be so obvious and far reaching they will need to bring the military in to radiate the 
insects. This was their procedure inSingapore and possibly on a huge scale in Maui, 
where there was a 20-year mosquito release launched this May 2023.  
 
Bali is a  sacred place protected by Gods and we must act in their name to protect 
ourselves from this underhand attack, or even experiment, if we give everyone the 

benefit of the doubt.

Patent the right to computerize the human body 
Bill Gates Patent Gives Him 'Exclusive Rights' To 'Computerize' the Human Body - 

The People's Voice 
US Patent 6,754,472, which is titled: Method and apparatus for transmitting power 
and data using the human body.A patent granted to Bill Gates awarded the self-
appointed world health czar the"exclusive rights”. 
“Civil liberties groups have expressed outrage over Gates’s move to patent the 
human body. “Body parts, in this case skin, should not be in any way patentable,” 
said Jim Thomas of the ETC group, which monitors developments in technology. 
“There are big questions here about whether individuals will be able to refuse this 
technology if it is used in, for example, tracking devices.” 
 
Klaus Schwab’s right hand man, Yuval Noah Harari, says there is no question that 
individuals will have no say whatsoever about refusing this technology. According to 
Harari, “The designer of life will no longer be god, the WEF are going to be the 
designers of the future of life.” 
 
Harari also explains why Gates’ patent on the human body is so important. Gates 
was at the forefront of the computer science revolution, according to Harari, and he 
is also at the forefront of “the revolution in the biological sciences.” And guess what? 
According to Harari, Bill Gates’ two revolutions are about to merge.”

20.10.23 Final Petition Outline 
We put together a couple of petitions, one in Bahasa Indonesia and one in English to 
stop the mosquito release that referenced all our research points it urged for a due 
diligence process regarding National Security, Community, Environmental Health, 
Legal, Financial, and Operational techniques of the Wolbachia Mosquito Release 

Program. We located the CARE2 petition a moratorium. 
 
26th October 2023 
PETITION created by Frances and Margaret 
Stop or Postpone  Mass Mosquito Gene Drive on Bali 
 
We invite you, the environmentally and socially-concerned men and women 
of Bali, Indonesia and the wider world to add your voice to this petition for 
Transparency, Safety, and Deeper Consideration 
Before  
the release of 200 million Wolbachia Bacteria-infected mosquito eggs in Denpasar, 
scheduled for November 13, 2023. 
 
The release was casually announced via Instagram, only one month ago  
But unexpected impacts, on the environment and human health, will be permanent. 
 
THIS PETITION AIMS TO: 
Outline and evidence the urgent need for a Due Diligence process 
 
to assign Financial, Legal and Operational Liability 
For the mosquito program  
 
Summary of unacceptable risks: 
 
• 
Millions of biting mosquitoes dependent on human blood will have a 
catastrophic effect on Tourism:  
 
• 
The World Mosquito Program strategy to BREED Wolbachia bacteria 
into mosquitoes means the people of Bali and tourists must expect to get hundreds 
of millions more mosquito bites. Mosquitoes must get a blood meal before they can 
produce their eggs. Every female will lay up to 100 eggs, three times in her adult 
lifespan. 
 
 
• 
Global Petition To Stop Gene Drives:  
 
• 
Gene drives have not received approval for open-air release or field 
testing because they spread a permanent genetic change in an ecosystem and the 
impacts on human health are impossible to predict, however well-meant.

claiming that even gene drive research was so danger that it should be stopped 
globally.

• 
Who is liable Bali mosquito release? 
Are the World Mosquito Program, researchers, funders, mosquito manufacturers and 
universities financially liable, if it goes wrong or doesn’t work?  
 
Diseases and damages will be nearly impossible to trace.  
 

We need Bali's Environmental Protection Agency and a relevant Competent 
Authority, before any release, to declare the extent of their liability or veto the 
release.  We demand clarity on who is protected from liability as well.

Due Diligence For Bali:  
 
• 
We strongly request Due Diligence Protocol that covers funding, 
transparency, efficacy assessments, safety evaluations, and an in-depth analysis of 
risks before any release takes place. The regulatory framework for the mosquitoes in 
Bali needs to address:  
 
• 
Risk of spread to other species, the disproportionate and ongoing 
increase in mosquito population, the risk assessment of vertical gene transfer in 
imported eggs and the safety of the Wolbachia bacteria and Wolbachia IP 
technology.

exclusive rights to all the digital equipment, data collected and data transmitted using 
the technology. This demonstrates a conflict of interests for World Mosquito

deliver information to an unrelated agency for unknown purposes?

30th October 2023 
Legal Strategy using  
Interim Injunction and request for proper planning process to be followed.  
Later found out that Indonesian Law does not have an ‘Injunction’ process. 
 
The beauty of an injunction is that the hearing can take place immediately (the next 
day) and without the defence * being present. 
It will call for a postponement of the release until Due Diligence is conducted, as per 
the petition. The bigger case down the line will argue that Due Diligence cannot be 
conducted without the exact Wolbachia Bacteria strain, genetic sequence and data 
from the IP Technology all being in the public domain, for the sake of monitoring its 
spread, its appearance in the environment and our bodies due to gene transfer, and 
therefore make effects and liability possible to trace and prove. 
I started with a case against the Planning Office to show the group how a National 
Planning Process is supposed to run and in what ways this release can be paused to 
ask to follow proper process. 
As Professor Richard Claproth holds a position in the Planning Office -  
Can we ask about the possibility of putting the injunction on the Government 
Planning Office for granting planning permission prematurely: 
Planning application 
Was a planning application received for the release? By who and in which 
department exactly? 
Planning Permission 
Was planning permission approved for the release? Who was it assessed by and 
approved by? 
Maps of release sites 
Is the planning office where you saw the maps? 
Are the public allowed to view the maps?  
1) For viewing in the planning office only? Or 
2) Can the map links be shared here to build the legal case and clean-up/solidarity 
action plans?  
Exemption From Risk Analysis 
Was it the Planning office who told us that the WMP had received an exemption for 

the Bali release? 
If not, who exactly did tell us about the exemption? (This is important as every time 
we make this statement that there was an exemption, WMP and others just throw a 
random risk analysis, into the chat or the group, as if 1) the WMP have done a risk 
analysis and 2) that there’s been an independent risk assessment done too. We 
know these statements are not true but we need that “in person” confirmation  that 
exemption was granted and by who. 
Planning Process 
We may be able to use the the legal instrument of the Aarhus Convention which say 
that the public must be consulted about plans that will significantly impact their 
environment and health. 
There was no Public Consultation - What we have been calling Socialisation of the 
information about the program but I think should include matters of consent, 
informed consent and manufactured consent:   
No Invittation for Comments from the Public -  
In recent years, planning offices have only offered the public the chance to comment, 
not object but still an objection period should be publicised in the newspapers before 
permission. 
No Objection Period: There should be a six week period between a planning 
application received and permission being granted for the public and other affected 
parties to make their objections.  
International Concern: Gene drives are of global concern, overseen by Military 
biosafety organization DARPA. Bali’s National Defence were not even informed of 
the release. So relevant authorities within the government were not given an 
objection period either to explore the risks from a bioweapons standpoint.  
Who do we serve an Interim Injunction on? 
I put a star by the word “ *defence ” as Denpasar WMP could be “the Defence”, the 
ministry of health as WMP partners in the release, the Bali’s Environment Protection 
Agency (as the US EPA regulate mosquito releases in the States). It could also be 
Bill Gates or WHO or the Patent owner who need to have an injunction put on them 
first.  
I started with a case against the Planning Office to show the group how a National 
Planning Process is supposed to run and in what ways this release can be asked to 
follow proper process. Next we will share the case for an interim injunction on the 
grounds of Bioweapons and the International conventions and legal instruments we 
could use there.    
 
 
3rd 11th 2023 
Due Diligence Questions - created by Frances and Margaret 
sent to Warsito lead scientist WMP, Yogyakarta University 
Due Diligence Questions 
Dear Warsito, 
Thank you for offering (at the Gladiator Bangsa webinar on the 30th September 
2023) to answer our technical questions about the Yogyakarta Wolbachia Mosquito 
Safety and Efficacy trials in a detailed presentation. 
As we are short of time, Gladiator Bangsa would be grateful for an interview format 
with Dr Kun, and a statement in response, rather than presentation. We intend to use 
these questions to inform a solid due diligence process, before a Bali release.  Very 
much appreciated for your prompt response. Respectfully, 

  
The following questions were forwarded to Save The Children Fund as soon as we 
found out that they were the Implementers, and therefore financially liable for the 
program. That was on the 8th November 2023. Due diligence questions were later 
compiled for the WHO et al, questioning the scientific foundations of Pandemic 
Preparedness, Prevention and Response, and not one of the nearly 200 questions 
was satisfactorily answered by any recipient.   
 
The format for all of the Due Diligence questions, in relation to mass mosquito 
releases is to establish:     
The ways in which the Bali release is the same as the Yogyakarta release so that we 
can be reassured by the findings of the Yogyakarta Trial. 
  
1. In what way is it the same? 
  
Wolbachia strain 
2. Is it the same Wolbachia strain as Yogyakarta? 
3. Will the Bali eggs contain the same strain as the Yogyakarta release? 
4. Did the Wolbachia IP Intellectual Property allow Yogyakarta’s environmental 
protection agency to know the exact gene sequence so that they could monitor its 
presence in water, other species? Was it made available to hospitals to test for its 
presence in human infections? 
5. Were the EPA and Hospitals actively given this identifying sample of the 
Wolbachia strain used and encouraged to conduct tests during and after the trial 
period?  If so was Wolbachia found to be present in humans or in Yogyakarta’s 
drinking water? 
6. If not why not?   Why were these tests not done? And if the active ingredients/and 
genetic sequences were not shared, what parameters can authorities use to check 
the spread of the Wolbachia bacteria? 
7. If the Wolbachia bacteria strain is different to Yogyakarta, do you know from 
where it originates? 
  
Experimental Release Permit 
Are University and factory Bio Safety Regulation the same in mosquito factories and 
labs? What are they? 
8. Are the Bali release eggs produced in the same laboratory as the Yogyakarta 
trials? 
9. Is the Bali release going to be released on an experimental permit? 
10. Was the Yogyakarta release conducted with an experimental permit? 
  
Number of eggs /adult mosquitoes released  
11. Were all the eggs released in Yogyakarta bred in one factory? 
12. How many eggs were released in Yogyakarta? 
13. How many eggs will be released in Bali? 
14. Can you simply explain why very different amounts are released in different 
areas? (200 million eggs are being released in Bali, 20 million were released in 
Florida, and Maui was given a 20-year program in May 2023?   
15. How did Yogyakarta decide on their figures to release?   
16. Can you explain why only male Wolbachia method mosquitoes were released in 
the past by WMP, but now the release of breeding biting females is being promoted 

as the preferred solution?  The escape of three females in Singapore was 
considered so dangerous that the release was stopped? 
17. Is it true that Wolbachia males are sterile? 
18. Is it the case that laboratory bred Wolbachia mosquitoes have evolved to 
express a female bias? 
19. Does this mean that Bali must expect that a lot more than half the 200 million 
eggs will be female? 
20. What percentage of the mosquito bred in the WMP laboratory are now female? 
21. In the past the WMP would collect the cups delivered to the community houses 
and sort the mosquitoes. In Denpasar will the cups be collected from the recruited 
homes at the larvae stage? Adulthood? or as empty cups? 
22. Does this mean that the home owners are responsible for the release of the 
adults? If not, where will they then be released? And the WMP? 
23. Why do the WMP involve the community in the incubation stage? 
24. Where specifically are they being told to release them? 
25. Were imported eggs used in Yogyakarta, if so where from? 
26. Are the Bali eggs to be imported from Brazil, Australia or Kuala Lumpur? 
27. Were imported eggs incubated directly in the community? 
28. WMP mention 12 countries in their Scale up report for releases, do you know 
which manufacturing countries are going to use the exact technology that 
Yogyakarta developed? 
29. You mentioned that there were differences between the Yogyakarta and Bali 
release, what specifically are they? 
30. Why do the releases need to be different? 
31. How is this different from a gene drive as all future generations of Aedes Aegpti 
will be infected by Wolbachia bacteria? Isn’t this the definition of a Gene drive? 
32. In an article during the Yogyakarta trial, you described that when infection 
reached about 60 percent, it would be stopped. Can you clarify which population you 
are talking about and how did you monitor the spread to 60 percent? 
33. Was it the spread of Wolbachia infection among mosquitoes? was it the spread 
of mosquitoes or were you referring to 60 percent or the target area having been 
treated with this mosquito technology? 
34. How did you stop it when you reached 60 percent? 
35. In the Yogyakarta  trial  were the equivalent statistics worked out by just  the 
existing populations in the areas for reYou The WMP claim that they will prevent 3 
million cases of Dengue. What model was used by the WMP to calculate this statistic 
for your trials? 
  
Blood 
36. Would you say that you have bred 200 million mosquitoes over the 20 years of 
the WMP study at Monash University? 
Approximately how many litres of blood did the University need to breed those 200 
million Mosquitoes? 
37. The public will want to question why its ok for that amount of blood to be 
expected from them to facilitate the breeding program? There is a shortage of blood 
and we are the silent food bank for the mosquitoes. 
38. Where did the blood from the laboratory come from? 
  
The Wolbachia Technology developed in WMP Universities Program 
39. Would you describe your technology as inoculating the mosquito’s species 

against the diseases? 
40. The WMP claims that it is breeding harmless mosquitoes, can you point us to the 
scientific papers that rigorously weigh up the benefits of increasing the population of 
mosquitoes and multiple bites versus reducing the species capacity to transmit 
disease? 
  
Eggs 
41. Do you know of any papers that address the problem of Inherited vertical Gene 
Transfer of Dengue, Malaria, Ockelbo etc. found in mosquito eggs and larvae at 
birth? 
42. Was this one of the biohazards that was considered negligible? 
43. Was the Wolbachia Bacteria that was micro injected thousands of times into the 
male mosquito sperm and the female mosquito eggs adopted into the genetic 
makeup to express it’s in all future generations of the mosquito species a new 
Wolbachia-carrying species Or, when you say Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes, are 
they Wolbachia carrying genetically or Wolbachia infected relying on the exact 
mechanism vertical gene transfer that you are claiming won’t occur with other 
bacteria and pathogens. 
44. There seems to be an extraordinary risk, that the 200 million eggs could be 
imported to Bali already carrying new or existing diseases. 
45. Did your University research the risks of vertical gene transfer and horizontal 
gene transfer of other diseases and infections in addition to the Wolbachia? 
46. Can you clarify if your method is to inject Wolbachia into adult male sperm? And 
female adults’ eggs? 
47. Is Wolbachia injected into in to mosquito eggs? 
  
The Harmless Bites Claim 
  
48. When the Wolbachia strains are isolated and the micro injections are done, 
would either of these operations have taken place in an antibiotic culture or an 
animal-based serum? 
There is a central worry that using antibiotic cultures could lead to antibiotic 
resistance for example infected mosquito bites 
49. Were students or researchers set any assignments to study intolerances caused 
by multiple mosquito bites? 
50. Are there any formal research papers to show a difference between multiple wild 
mosquito bites and multiple Wolbachia mosquito bites, to support the WMP claim 
that they are harmless? 
  
Wolbachia Internet Protocol IP Technology 
  
51. Why is “Use of the Wolbachia IP Technology” stated as the only risk of legal 
challenge, in the WMPs Scale Up Report? 
52. What are the legal challenges that the WMP anticipate? 
53. Do they relate to data access or use? 
54. Can you explain what the Wolbachia IP Technology is? 
55. What is the capacity of the AI Technology? 
56. Does the AI Technology, in the released Wolbachia eggs, have the capacity to 
reassemble itself automatically with the bacteria? 
57. Could this technology track the future spread of Wolbachia or just the first initial 

release? 
58. Can the technology differentiate between different strains of Wolbachia bacteria? 
You mentioned in the Zoom meeting that the different strains of Wolbachia don’t 
interact for example the Wolbachia in human parasites and the Wolbachia strains in 
fish and birds roundworms? 
59. Are you concerned that Wolbachia as a symbiotic bacterium, could evolve, adapt 
and horizontal gene transfer through an ecosystem more quickly and in ways that 
Environmental Protection Agencies cannot predict? 
60. Does the IP Technology involve a substance that can be registered, at a 
distance, by digital equipment? 
61. Can this be measured for example by drones as used in Sri Lanka or can the AI 
relay information to a remote console?  Who followed and managed the information 
gathered by this means in the Yogyakarta trial? 
62. Does the AI have the capacity to transmit and receive data? 
63. As an Internet Protocol Technology involves an internet facilitated exchange 
function, can the released organisms receive instructions? 
64. Does that mean the spread of mosquitoes and the spread of the released 
Wolbachia -bacteria strain, can be controlled if necessary? 
  
Definition of Success 
  
65. Why do you think that cases of Dengue doubled in Sri Lanka since the WMP 
release two years ago? 
66. Does the WMP call Sri Lanka a success? 
67. Why do you think the larvae crisis facing Sri Lanka did not happen in 
Yogyakarta? 
68. Do you know of any substantial differences between the release in Sri Lanka and 
the trial you conducted in Yogyakarta? 
69. Yogyakarta Trial Results: The are dengue cases from the project areas in and 
around Yogyakarta show big increases from the project start date (2014) which only 
go down by 2018. This implies increased disease and death from the outset. Then a 
reduction in cases. But then the data show another huge jump to 2019. Is this data 
inconsistent with claims in the New England Journal of Medicine, of a 77% reduction 
in cases around Yogyakarta? 
70. Do you have any concerns about the use of the Mosquito method you designed, 
for the Bali release? 
71. Do you or other researchers have any reservations about increasing the 
population of Aedes Egypti in the wild by billions? 
72. Can you explain  more about the independent arm of the World Health 
Organization that did the study of Social, economic, health and environmental 
impacts? 
73. Which body funded the Risk Assessment? 
74. Does the Artificial Intelligence connected to Wolbachia IP Technology CNN 
belong to Microsoft? 
75. What else was Microsoft Artificial intelligence modeling used for? 
76. Was it used for the Identification and risk assessment of 50 biohazards research 
and results? 
77. How was it used for mapping and choice of release sites? 
78. Are the local  households that are incubating the eggs for the WMP being paid to 
take the cups? 

79. What are there responsibilities and liability for the cups and contents? 
80. What was the two-year socialization program to prepare Yogyakarta? 
81. Was there any public consultation or consent process,  or  just promotion and 
education? 
82. Why do you think Bali was given so much less notice? Did  anything change a 
WMP decision to conduct other releases first? 
83. Do you know if only the Health Ministry of each country for release is partnering 
with the WMP, rather than a whole government coordination process? 
 
We sent 20 referenced ‘points for concern’ along with ‘Due diligence questions’ to 
the WMP.   
The potential human health risks had not been researched by any third party outside 
of the WMP and the WHO, who used only AI modelling. 
Our research found that all risks on the following list were actually proven and 
guaranteed to happen following mosquito releases. 
The artificial intelligence assessment found them all negligible. 
 
1. Ecological effects 
2. Genetic biodiversity change 
3. Change in genetic diversity 
4. Transfer of Wolbachia genome to invertebrates  
5. Transfer of Wolbachia genome to vertebrates 
6. New mosquito species evolves 
7. Selection for more virulent arboviruses  
8. Vector change 
9. Increased vector density 
10. Increased host biting 
11. Female biased sex ratio 
12. Increased mosquito host range 
13. Increased filarial fitness 
14. Replacement of dengue vectors 
15. Transfer of other pathogens 
16. Environmental change 
17. Ecosystem service change 
18. Ecological niche 
19. Geographic distribution 
20. Mosquito management efficacy 
21. Increased difficulty to mosquito control  
22. Mosquito behaviour change  
23. Increased resistance to insecticide 
24. Strain selection 
25. More dengue infections occur 
26. Increased dengue virulence 
27. Increased biting 
28. Household control 
29. Avoidance strategy 
30. Complacency 
31. Standards of public health 
32. Interference with other dengue control  
33. Severity of disease 

34. More dengue cases 
35. Dengue transmission 
36. Nuisance biting 
37. Other pathogens (transmission of nondengue pathogens) 
38. Dengue evolution 
39. Dengue vector competence 
40. Feeding frequency 
41. Mosquito density 
42. Host preference 
43. Nondengue vector competence 
44. Economic and sociocultural impacts 
45. Economic change 
46. Health care cost 
47. Tourism 
48. Loss income 
49. Expense change 
50. Socio-behavioural change 
51. Scapegoating 
52. Migration 
53. Adverse media 
54. Social conflict 
55. Class action 
56. Social fear 
 
I highlight 53 “Adverse media” which is the new block to critical assessments. An Un-
herd hearing at the House of Lords (GB) shared how the Digital Watchdog uses AI to 
track ‘adversarial’ information for deletion, rather than untrue information. Therefore 
AI referring to the problem of Adverse Media means that it doesn’t matter if it’s true 
or not, but could cause an obstacle to the deployment of the mosquitoes. Later, there 
is a report about AI as a military retaliatory protocol, that bombed an Indonesian 
maternity hospital in Gaza, in retaliation for the postponement of the mosquito 
release that we achieved.  
 
I highlight 54 “Social Conflict” defined as ‘the struggle for agency’. Men and women 
above corporations and public servants have struggled to have their superior 
jurisdiction acknowledged and the UN are even trying to pass a treaty to make 
defining oneself as a biological man or woman a ‘crime against humanity’ making it 
even harder to establish our jurisdiction. Soon we will all be criminalised by ‘hate 
speech laws’ and the simultaneous release of private messages on the private 
platform Telegram, which has now been forced to go public and disclose messages, 
even deleted from the time of its set-up in 2013. This will include of course millions of 
angry posts as experts and unacknowledged victims of the industrial military 
pharmaceutical complex lost their jobs and lives during the pandemic and had to 
move to this safe platform to share their concerns.  
 
I highlight 55 “Class Action” which should include everything that is written here, 
every action of Gladiator Bangsa, every action of Hawaii Unites, Every action of the 
World Council For Health and every other peace worker who has contested the 
military offensive against us and counter-intuitive justifications for nuclear and gain of 
function and military spending of public money. 

 
The culmination of my class action was to file an appeal in the Swiss Federal 
Supreme Court April 10th 2024, where Siti Fadilah Supari former Minister for Health 
refused to share pathogens with the WHO and military before, and also the criminal 
actions of the US government and military in the Kingdom of Hawaii have been 
recorded, as well as war crimes in Israel.  
 
I highlight 56 “Social Fear” as more and more people wake up to the fact that all 56 
risks identified are the real objectives of the implementers; to demoralise, criminalize 
and eventually kill us, but not before all wealth, resources and fines are extracted 
from those who survive and sovereign nations, as punishment for resisting.  
 
I am not sure if it is the same for Maui but in Indonesia, WMP claimed 95% 
acceptance by community but no village heads, planning, or public consent sought. 
 
5th November 2023 Sunday morning 8am 
Meeting with the head of the Puskor, Deva Satriya Nusantara Hindunesia and Bali’s 
Health Office Representative in the park. Deva received text messages confirming 
the mosquito release would be postponed, on his telephone from the Acting 
Governor, read and witnessed by 15 people. Bali’s Health Ministry Representative 
came to speak to us and confirmed that the Governor intended to stop the 
mosquitoes. 
A group gave out flyers, designed and printed by a group, since dismantled. 
 
November 5th 2023 Sunday afternoon: Deva Satriya Nusantara received an 
invitation to a Save The Children Fund meeting with full list of attendees. It was to be 
held the next day 6/11/23 and the wider group of 300 people were invited to register 
and attend if we wanted to.  The meeting was held at the Inas Hotel, on the 6/11/23. 
Deva Satriya Nusantara of Hindunesia had registered additional attendees when he 
was told the list of officials had been invited. It was found out that the World 
Mosquito Program intentionally misled the Ballinese. Save The Children Fund’s Bali 
office had completely closed down. (I informed Save The Children Fund UK of the 
charges and the military involvement by phone and letter and neither were followed 
up. 
 
Bali Solidarity, Hindunesia, and Gladiator Bangsa were told (by the Governor’s 
Health Dept Representative) that it was an emergency meeting, to address 
postponement of the release and 10 of us registered to attend.  
 
November 5th 2023 Sunday evening: I composed and sent an email to all the 
attendees, to support a decision to postpone the release until due diligence was 
completed. I attached the Bioweapons Paper, GM Mosquito White Papers and Due 
Diligence questions to compare Yogyakarta trials with Bali egg deployment plan. I 
also included the full petition points in Bahasa Indonesia. 
 
5.11.23 
This is a copy of the email message I sent on the 5th November, and why I sent 
them, to all the attendees invited for the meeting the following day, at what turned 
out to be a stakeholder meeting. 
 

On Sunday 5th November 2023 night, we still thought the meeting on the 6th was an 
emergency meeting of relevant authorities to discuss the release of the WMP 
mosquitoes. I wanted to make sure that the attendees had all the dangers clear in 
their minds and not claim ignorance as some sort of defence, if the release went 
ahead.  
Therefore, I looked for as many addresses as I could find for the officials attending 
and I sent them an email with the Petition Points and references in Bahasa 
Indonesia and then also the due diligence questions and my research papers. The 
only difference to the email that I am sharing here, is that I attached a 'bioweapons in 
terms of mosquitoes', update for the Defence Department. I knew they had seen the 
bioweapons paper before but I wanted to connect the risks of using wolbachia 
mosquitoes, in particular.  
 
The only acknowledgement of the emails was from Dr Kun, who sent me a message 
saying that the Ministry of Defence was very grateful for my update; a new report on 
the bioweapons in relation to mosquitoes work.

Now I look at the list of email addresses again and see Bali Police, I realize that 
maybe this email is what had “opened an investigation earlier” with the Bali police, 
rather than the meeting with the Health Minister's assistant in the park with Deva and 
the Professor of Biology last Sunday? However the fact that the police did already 
have an investigation open, means that the Bali’s Head of Intelligence, Chief of 
Police and the Health Officer who mentioned the earlier investigation did actually 
know of the release in Denpasar. And remember this was a turnaround by the police 
as they had just said they had not heard of the release. 
 
(It was sent before the meeting on Monday 6th, so the email only has the scientific, 
ecological, and health risks, not the point of political and legal importance that came 
out at the meeting: It being a foreign-funded program). It is a concern that there has 
still been no response to these real dangers or the scientific due diligence request. I 

believe the fact that these emails were sent and received will show that the 
responsibility lies between the stakeholders (attendees) as they were made aware of 
them. 
 
On Wednesday night, I thought of how I should respond to the formal invitation from 
the Implementer. I thought of having the meeting on zoom, so they could not misuse 
any photos of us smiling and say the program had somehow been suddenly, 
miraculously “socialised” and the community even the opposition all accepted it with 
open arms. I thought about trying not to say anything that would be impossible to 
show evidence for, on the spot, and I thought of how Save The Children Fund and 
World Mosquito Fund would equally misrepresent our absence, if none of the 5 
expats that they had invited, showed up at all. It would also be disrespectful to the 
Village Heads and not one of us might have a chance to explain that we visited all 
the other Village Heads with Tchok and none of them had heard of the release and 
not one had wanted the release.  
 
I decided that I wanted to alert the implementer to the karmic consequences of 
managing a program/laboratory/release/trial of that scale as he didn't have any 
knowledge or interest in the science that is said to support it.  
On the morning we were supposed to meet Save the Children Fund and ask 
questions of the World Mosquito Program scientists, I composed the long message 
while we waited to see what we should do. Dr Kun had said that National Defence 
would want to be there to hear the answers to the due diligence questions. Bali 
Police had said to us that they were doing any further investigation and biosafety 
protection, and Deva had said that the Imigrasi were going down to the meeting too, 
to potentially deport the scientists involved. They had asked us to find out which 
scientists we would be speaking to, so that they didn't have to wait until they were at 
the airport or did something wrong to detain them. Immigration officials had told 
Deva to warn us that we might be detained as well if we attended the meeting. 
 
I wasn’t supposed to mention the authorities who were coming to detain the 
implementers and ensure the decommissioning of the laboratory and seizure of the 
eggs and yet we were not to disrupt the appointment by saying we were not going 
ourselves. That was okay because I decided to make our basic courtesy apologies 
later. Unfortunately, Wied, the Save The Children Fund implementer, messaged to 
say they were there. Then he rang twenty minutes later. That meant there were no 
police, no defence and no imigrasi there. SCF and WMP were waiting for us. I 
panicked as I did not want to say something I hadn't decided to say. I declined the 
call and sent the message.  
 
I understand there was a major demonstration and press conference the following 
day in Jakarta where it was reported that the mosquitoes had caused a major uproar 
and rift between politics and defence.

Subject: KODIM Colonel Inf Dody Triyo Hadi Mosquito Bioweapons extra details for 
WMP Denpasar 6.11.2023 Meeting 
 
Ministers are meeting today to confirm the postponement of the mass mosquito 

release, on the following grounds. Please investigate and comment to support the 
government in stopping it altogether.  
 
Please explore the question of driving worse variants of disease by spreading a 
super spreading bacteria. Also how mosquito bites weaken the immune system even 
if they are not infected. Please ask why the army were involved in releasing the eggs 
in Yogyakarta? And see the health Due Diligence questions attached. 
 
Would the public be able to evidence for medical insurance if they get an illness 
related to the release, or who would be liable for costs when health, environment and 
the economy are lost? Who wiill people be asked to make complaints to? Could you 
explore the consequences of 5G in tandem with the roll out of 200 million Wolbachia 
Internet Protocol (IP) Technology mosquitoes?   
 
This is the text of the Gladiator Bangsa petition with links to papers on points of 
concern. I send them to you so you can prepare for tomorrow's meeting, I also attach 
the detailed scientific questions for safety and efficacy, which the World Mosquito 
Program have yet to answer.  
 
Petition in Bahasa Indonesia: STOP / TUNDA PROGRAM PELEPASAN JUTAAN

With humble respect and gratitude for meeting and having the power to stop this 
disaster  
Micklem, Frances 
The following are some of my original research which I attach to help you raise the 
questions that have to be answered. I absolutely do not seek to prove anything and I 
don't write on anyone else's behalf. I was just concerned there might not be a formal 
opportunity to share the extent of risks Bali is facing. 
 
Attached are White Papers and my Draft Papers from working at Institute For 
Responsible Technology in 2021, when we released this 
https://protectnaturenow.com/pdfviewer/legislative-report/ and this film: We were 
within 2 weeks of making a cataclysmic release. 
 
https://protectnaturenow.com/ 
Gates has released infected mosquitoes before without permission.

No thank you to gain of function vaccine research and manufacture in Bali 
https://protectnaturenow.com/pdfviewer/gain-of-function-research-executive-

Stop the roll out of 5G or we really will not know from where our degraded health is 
coming from. 
There was also a global moratorium on 5G called for. 
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9806221/ 
 
Lets ask for Bali to be the control group. Bali doesn't need external medicine, we 

have our own. 
Bali doesn't need any health, food or cultural or charitable donations. Let Bali show 
what can be done without this so-called philanthropic interventions.  
Notice that Merck (also US-based) have offered 100 million doses of Ivermectin 
(parasite treatment) to tackle Wolbachia-based Filarial disease in Africa. The men 
and women of Bali have not been given the opportunity for informed consent and we 
do not consent to this attack.

                           Smart city plans for Denpasar and even the capital in Kilimantan.  
                        Why would you give away control of Bali, the economic face of 
Indonesia and the capital? 
                        AI modeling instead of real risk assessments 
                        AI mapping for how to 'deploy' the eggs (Deploy is a military word 
used often in my bioweapons paper. If you want me to explain anything, I'll be 
outside this meeting.

There are tens of thousands of Russians living in Bali and everyone is welcome 
thankfully. Don't overlook the bigger picture that this will be seen as an attack by 
America. Whether it is or it isn't, we don't want to get caught between two 
superpowers and make Indonesia a conveniently remote battle field. 
 
 
Not for Profit.   
By Bill Gates 
World Mosquito Program 
University  
      
Both Profit and Not for Profit:  
World Health Organization (Profit and Non-profit Stake Holders). 10% funded by Bill 
Gates and therefore steered by him strategically. 
WHO are an un-elected organization,  
Self appointed and who approve all the GMO mosquitoes too. They are funded and 
managed by pharmaceutical companies who have paid billions in liability cases (see 
for example Pfizer on "Violations Tracker" on line). 
 
In April 2024 the WHO will bring in their own amendments and call it legislation. 
They will appoint themselves as the authorities (above governments and nations) to 
decide when to call a pandemic, what lockdowns, curfews, research, vaccines, 
releases, approvals and mandates will follow and insist that governments buy these 
'recommendations' with public money, however crippling for the nation's economy 
(tourism will be ruined if 200 million mosquitoes are released here). 
 

You have your own legislation from 2017 that says that the Coordination Ministers 
must meet and reach consensus before any big impact strategy is implemented. 
Please use that legislation to stop this. It is an outrageous oversignt to not consult or 
even inform you all.  
 
Please also ask about the Wolbachia IP Technology which could monitor the release 
but the WMP claim the wolbachia is natural and contains nothing unnatural.  Ask the 
Health Minister please, if he did indeed buy the license to use the Wolbachia IP 
technology, why it was not disclosed as the monitoring system. 
 
No one has said they will be liable for damages directly traced to the release, so 
please decide that at this meeting too. 
 
If you together today make the right choice, you will announce the veto of the 
mosquito program on grounds of unacceptable risks to public health and livelihoods. 
Then when the immediate threat has passed, you can move on to saving the world 
by calling out the massive conflict of interests in the WHO.  
 
Other countries are desperate for help in challenging these technologies and that

6th November 2023 - Outside the Stakeholder Meeting  
Even though we had registered our confirmation that we would attend, none of us 
were admitted - until after an hour Prof. Richard and Deva were allowed in and 
discovered the massive Bali mosquito releases were not a government program but 
funded by a private Australian family.  
The public questions and answers session was on the itinerary and we did not 
understand why we were not admitted, as we had brought the concerning 
information about the release and anticipated that they would be anxious to hear it, 
in time.  
 
Wiwied Trisnadi, Chairman of Save The Children Fund introduced himself to me as 
‘the implementer’ before the meeting started. I told him that WMP scientists had 
publicly confirmed that ‘the implementer” will hold liability for damages. I also told 
him that the WMP had definitively said they did not know who the ‘implementers for 
the Bali program were. Wiwied said he did not know Save The Children Fund were 
liable. 
 
This declaration of liability was made at a public live-streamed meeting by Gladiator 
Bangsa. By World Mosquito Program’s Warsito and Professor Adarini from 

Yogyakarta. Where they made the claim that they did not know who the Implementer 
was for the Bali release. They also stated that it would be “the Implementer” who 
was liable for the consequences of the release. This was repeated several times in 
that first meeting, where I was invited as a speaker and the WMP Yogyakarta 
scientists and representatives were sent from the ministries of Health and Defence 
as well to discussed the release. (Evidence: Gladiator Bangsa Channel: GMO 
Mosquitoes as Bioweapons and the conference that took place three days later, in 
Bahasa Indonesia (Early October 2023). These videos may not exist any more as 
the Indonesian Ministry of Communications did not just ‘temporarily suspend’ the 
Gladiator Bangsa Youtube Channel but told Professor Richard Claproth that they 
had ‘permanently deleted’ it and he had . This is destroying evidence, when there 
are two open cases: The criminal case against the World Mosquito Program and 
Save The Children Fund, and the civil case against the Health Minister. I believe 
1300 videos were destroyed. The Ministry of Communications must be asked to 
retrieve and return those files to the public domain for these cases, in the public 
interest.  
 
Two videos remain:

Bali: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2jVntTKPWg 
Evidence of genocide following disclosure by the WMP Scientists. They knew that 
the Culex and Anopheles species spike after a release of Aedes Aegypti, and that 
had already caused an outbreak of Japanese Encephalitis. Also acknowledgment by 
the scientists that the mosquito eggs contain at least 11 other other viruses.  Proof of

I also asked Wiwied what previous job had prepared him to deploy hundreds of 
millions of mosquitoes on a city. He replied he had been in the Ministry of Health’s 
Pandemic Preparedness department. He and his colleague Bekti Andari remained 
outside the meeting with Bali Solidarity representatives. They made notes of our 
questions and concerns. Neither Wiwied nor Bekti, the Save The Children Fund 
management, had any understanding of the science or any of the risks associated 
with mass releases. They offered to schedule a meeting with the WMP scientists.  
 
6th November Evening  
Deva enlisted lawyer to decide criminal charges and enlisted journalists to share 
news of the releases and the charges. 
 
7th November 2023 
Richard enlisted the group of 300 to collate all misleading information they had found 
during their research. 
 
 2) WMP Misleading information - Original 13 Pages of Misleading information 
researched by Bali Solidarity 
 
(Reference: https://tekno.tempo.co/read/1792352/kasus-demam-berdarah-

meningkat-bali-gunakan-metode-wolbachia  
Instead of enquiring whether Bali would be suitable or seeking consent or 
discussion:  
“We’re pleased to scale up our work in Indonesia and extend the benefits of the 
Wolbachia technology to Bali’s communities and to the many visitors to the island,” 
says Dr. Claudia Surjadjaja, WMP’s Director of Advocacy and External Relations, 
Asia. 
Truth Clarity:  To describe a massive increase in the female breeding mosquito 
population as a benefit, to communities and to tourists, is to refer to two major risks 
as if they are benefits.  
Contradiction: Claudia refers to ‘wolbachia technology’ but then the WMP promote 
the mosquitoes as natural and not engineered? The WMP repeatedly make both 
contradictory statements. 
 
The former states, with scientific references, that Wolbachia mosquito IP technology 
is genetically engineered. It contradicts the continual messages on the WMP website 
that the mosquitoes are natural, just to avoid the uncertainties of the science: "Our 
method does not suppress mosquito populations or involve genetic modification 
(GM), as the genetic material of the mosquito is not altered."  
One of the reasons that mosquito releases are allowed is the belief that the released 
mosquitoes will suppress the population of wild mosquitoes and die out themselves. 
Wolbachia mosquitoes do not do either. 
 
When the WMP write that ‘the genetic material of the mosquito is not altered’, it is 
misleading. It is a common biotech industry argument to evade regulation of new 
products. GMOs are subject to some regulation but gene edited microorganisms 
have been allowed on to the market on the false scientific grounds that either the 
process is accurate and predictable. It is not accurate. Even the WMP scientists said 
it took thousands of injections of the bacteria in to adult female mosquitoes eggs and 
males’ sperm before the mosquitoes either survive or the bacteria was transmitted to 
a next generation. Even worse, it is a gain of function. 
 
The WMP claim that Wolbachia is naturally found in many insects, but not Aedes 
Aegypti, and so the genetic material of the  mosquito is actually altered. This article 
shows how they’re using CRISPR technology with these mosquitoes and that’s gene 
modification 
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-24654-z www.protectnaturenow.com 
regulatory problems of gene editing microorganisms  
 
WMP claim that when they injected Wolbachia bacteria in to the Aedes Aegypti, 
studies showed ‘promising results’. Wolbachia ‘seemed’ to block other bacteria and 
viruses from reproducing inside the mosquito. Many studies say that scientists are 
‘unclear’ about why or how Wolbachia works. These findings are unscientific and it 
should be  but it is a symbiont so over time its relationship to other disease 
pathogens is likely to change. Results described as promising, likely too, and unclear 
are not qualified or quantified benefits that justify the risks of releasing 200 million 
mosquitoes in a city, as an experiment. The findings do not explain the money spent 
on ensuring the eggs were deployed.  
 
Drive Variants 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6062015/  
Manufacturers know that stronger variants of diseases appear when challenged.  
 
Gene Drive 
The mosquitoes were genetically modified as well, to transmit Wolbachia infection to 
all offspring. That would never happen in nature, as there are rules to inheriting only 
half the genes of your parents. This is a dangerous Gene Drive Technology. The 
WMP deny it is a gene drive.  https://www.bmj.com/content/352/bmj.i1086/rr?  
 
IP Technology Denied 
Wolbachia detection in Aedes aegypti using MALDI-TOF MS coupled to artificial 
intelligence https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-00888-1 confirms that the 
Wolbachia Bacteria is definitely not natural. It is carrying a patent-protected IP 
technology (owned by WMP’s Australian founder) coupled with CNN artificial 
intelligence, owned by Microsoft. The inclusion of two foreign surveillance 
technologies, have exclusive rights and access to all the related equipment and data. 
Inclusion of IP Technology was completely hidden.

AI military decision-making, surveillance and data collection tool, not social.  
 
Wolbachia mosquitoes have in the past been "infected with a lethality gene." The 
reason for this was to make sure that the new species/intervention does not persist 
in nature and change the gene pool. WMP do not state there is a lethality gene in the 
Bali release. They claim there is no change to the mosquito DNA. But nobody knows 
how the lethal effects of a gene or sterile males might affect other mosquitoes, or 
interactions. There is, for example, evidence that GM Wolbachia produces an 
immune response and spike protein in cats, which might be the tip of the iceberg.

Unannounced releases before the date when recruits started incubating them. Who

WMP and Department of Health say ‘the implementers are liable’. No one knows 
who exactly the implementers are at the webinar.  
Save the Children declare they are the Implementers. Wiwied is Chairman.  
 
Save The Children Fund were not able to answer even one question. The 
implementers do not know the science or the risks.  
They have no intention of accepting liability as this year they closed their offices on 
Bali.  Therefore not planning to stay around to monitor the aftermath. 
 
 Save The Children Fund UK are collaborating with the Bali provincial government 
and central government. Wiwied, the chairman’s, previous job was in the Ministry of 

Health Pandemic Preparedness department.

The World Mosquito Program literature and promotion, regardless of efficacy or 
safety, shows that the release is not a health strategy but a military strategy: An act 
of war on the Indonesian people, treason by the minister of health and a major 
National Security threat of mosquito production and deployment, as bioweapons of 
mass destruction. There is no other reason why the mosquito strategy was not 
passed by Bappenas. 
 
Found to be an Australian program, fully funded by a family of bakers, not a 
Government Program: has anybody asked Why? 
“Non-national agents will tolerate inflicting damage” on the population as well as 
intended targets. This of course goes for our hostile use of biological weapons on 
other countries as well.  
Dissemination includes inhalation, dermal exposure and ingestion. Eg. contamination 
of the food supply has been described as the weaponization of agriculture.

Illegal: Reference 2017 Legislation determines that all major impact programs must 
be presented to the Coordination Committee of ministers.  
 
None of the planning, defence officials, village heads or the acting governor were 
even informed of the WMP mosquito release. And yet it was found in both levels of 
law with no socialisation or agreement. 
Still no Coordination Department meeting took place.  
Releases are therefore written into law and against the law, contradictory.

Wolbachia & Genetically Engineered Mosquitoes 
The former states, with scientific references, that wolbachia mosquito tech is 
genetically engineered. That contradicts the statement on the WMP website: "Our 
method does not suppress mosquito populations or involve genetic modification 
(GM), as the genetic material of the mosquito is not altered." In fact it seems the 

second part of the statement is a modification designed to evade the GM label by 
qualifying it to apply only to the mosquito, not the bacteria.

If you check the links to the papers I posted, you will see that Wolbachia is naturally 
found in many insects, but not Aedes Aegypti, the mosquito that carries dengue. Put 
wolbachia in, and it blocks the virus from reproducing inside the mosquito. All well 
and good, save the bacteria "is infected with a lethality gene." Contrary to WMP 
website, the program DOES use a GMO. They will claim there is no change to the 
mosquito DNA. Many papers advise caution—nobody knows what the effects might 
be on the mosquito, or interactions with other stuff the mosquito comes into contact 
with. There is, e.g. evidence that GM wolbachia produces immune response in 
cats... which might be the tip of the iceberg. I'm far less qualified than others here to 
comment, but this 2018 paper clearly highlights the risk of releasing something 
experimental. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/ PMC6062015/

develop detectable levels of protection, scientists said they were encouraged enough 
to continue development of the technique. 
According to Principia Scientific International, “Researchers say the genetically 
modified mosquitos will not be used at large to vaccinate millions of people. The 
reason why mosquitos were used instead of syringes, they claim, was to save costs.”

WHO treaty opposition

oppose- whos-power-grab/ 
Dr. Meryl Nass: WHO’s pandemic treaty to remove human rights, sovereignty under 
the pretext of pandemic preparedness and biosecurity agendas 
Board-certified internist and biological warfare epidemiologist Dr. Meryl Nass issued 
a disturbing warning that the Pandemic Treaty being pushed by the World Health 
Organization (WHO) is going to take over the jurisdiction of everything in the world. 
During the International COVID Summit of the European Parliament held in Brussels, 
Belgium in 
        Page 11 of 13 
 May, Nass said that the health authorities will use the treaty to impose the idea that 
climate change, animals, plants, water systems, and ecosystems are all central to 
health. 
According to Nass, the Pandemic Treaty will remove human rights protections 
currently embedded in the International Health Regulations (IHR), enforce 
censorship and digital passports, get rid of freedom of speech, require governments 
to push a single "official" narrative and dictate which drugs should be prescribed in 
every country. 
"We're undergoing a soft coup," she alerted. 
She also pointed out how the organisation is moving to create a whole new set of 
laws and ignore the existing human rights laws under the pretext of pandemic 
preparedness and the biosecurity agenda. Nass divulged how it is working on 
binding states so there are no longer recommendations, providing a liability shield – 
for vaccine manufacturers and public health officials – getting rid of intellectual 
property rights, and moving supplies from one country to another. 
The doctor from Maine added that WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom 
Ghebreyesus would be able to declare pandemics at the mere threat of a public 
health emergency of international concern. He can also call for a world lockdown for 
declared climate change emergencies as per the treaty.

Watch the full video of the International Covid Summit where Dr. Meryl Nass spoke 
about the Pandemic Treaty's alarming provisions. 
https://youtu.be/4MrIsXDKrtE 
Meanwhile, in a separate interview with the independent media organisation Bright 
Light News, the epidemiologist stressed how the "One Health" concept will put 
animals and ecosystems on the same level as humans. She said under the direction 
of the WHO's Pandemic Treaty and proposed changes to the IHR, the United 
Nations (UN) specialised health agency would be given centralised powers 
superseding those of its 194 member states' sovereign governments.

8th November 2023 
The Misleading Information raw research was sent to me at 2am on the 8th and I 
distilled it into 23 charges of Fraudulent Misrepresentation that were filed later that 
day. 
 
Charges Filed 8th November 2023  
On Monday 6th November 2023 (1) the World Mosquito Program (2) and Save The 
Children Fund’s (3)  
Massive Mosquito Release Program (4)  
was found to be a Foreign Program NOT A GOVERNMENT PROGRAM (5) 
And therefore must Cease and Desist (STOP) 
 
It is illegal (6),  fraudulent (7), without efficacy (8), without notice (9), without 
transparency (10) or disclosure (11) and of high National Security risk of being a 
hostile deployment of biological agents (12). A figure of 40 billion Australian Dollars 
was paid by the Gillespie Family fund, to establish stake holders who would allow the 
releases in Bali (13). There has been no Due Diligence done in regard to operational 
management, financial management, regulation (14) or Liability (15)  
 
 Immediate Action required for Hankamrata: Total people defense 
16) Immediate confiscation of the mosquito eggs  
by the Police with Army support - Wednesday 8th November, within office hours. 
17) The mosquito factory must not be given prior warning of your arrival. WMP and 
SCF are managed by a non-national agent.  
18) Or any opportunity to sell of transport the eggs to another buyer,  
19) Or dropped on another community.  
20) Or disposed of in Bali unsafely  
21) Risk of retaliation. They must not have time to distribute the eggs in any of the 
sites identified 
22) Already recruited families to incubate the eggs. 
23) Laws broken Legal Instruments applicable. 
Copies of the above charges have been copied and sent by email to attendees of the 
above meeting.  
 
8th November 2023 evening.  
Eventually the charges were formally filed but the more senior police officers; Health 
Officer, Head of Intelligence and Chief of Bali Police all said they had not heard of 
the release initially. The Chief of police was on the stakeholder list and therefore 
could be in receipt of a portion of the 40 million Australian dollars spent obtaining 
agreement for the release to go ahead. 
 
The acting governor rang Deva, while we were still filing the charges in the Police 
Station and he invited us all up to the Governor’s House, where we received tea, 
accolades and thanks for saving Bali from the mosquito release in time.  

 
9th November 2023 
A Notification from Acting Governor of Bali arrived, endorsed by the President  
 
“A. On Tuesday, November 7, 2023 at 10 p.m. 07.30 WITA, coordination was carried 
out with the Bali Health Office regarding the launch of the method for spreading 
Wolbachia mosquito eggs which will be implemented in Bali with the results: 
 
1.⁠ ⁠This has not been implemented and the Bali Provincial Health Office is still waiting 
for instructions from the Governor of Bali. 
 
2.⁠ ⁠As for the Governor of Bali's instructions regarding the Launching of the 
Wolbachia Method which will be implemented in Bali: 
 
a. The Bali Provincial Government asked WMP and Safe The Children as organizers 
of the Wolbachia mosquito launch activity to provide massive socialization to the 
Balinese people. 
 
b. Provincial Government. Bali requested that a scientific study be carried out first 
with experts to ensure that there is a guarantee of the safety of the program for both 
humans and the environmental ecosystem. 
 
c. The Bali Provincial Government requested that this program really be an official 
program from the Ministry of Health to be implemented in Bali, not from a private 
sector or foundation. 
 
d. "The Bali Provincial Government proposes that this program trial not be carried 
out in Bali, because there is controversy over rejection from some Balinese people 
and foreign tourists who live in Bali."   
 
9th November 2023 
The police assured us that the eggs would be confiscated and the release program 
definitively stopped at dawn on 9th November 2023 however Wiwied proposed a 
time and venue for the meeting between the Bali Solidarity group, Gladiator Bangsa 
and Puskor to ask the scientific questions of the WMP scientists who were coming 
especially. We thought it was a trick, as they must know the program had been 
stopped and the SCF and WMP were under investigation. 
 
I sent a copy of the due diligence questions to Wiwied. I asked Deva what to do. He 
then asked Imigrasi. Bali’s Imigration Police asked me (through Deva) to ask for a 
formal invitation to the meeting, so that the police and authorities could get names to 
investigate.  
 
Wiwied Trisnadi, SCF, sent the following invitation:   
 
“Consider accelerating activities to control dengue hemorrhagic fever based on 
national strategies, one of which uses Wolbachia innovation.  
We invite you to attend discussion activities at: 
 
Day/Date: Friday, November 10 2023 

Time: 14.00-15.30 
Place: 2nd floor of Mamma Mia pizza hut, Renon 
 
From Save the Children Indonesia who will be present 
1.⁠ ⁠Prof Cameron Simmons - Scientist 
2.⁠ ⁠dr Citra Indriani MPH (TBC) - Online 
3.⁠ ⁠Bekti Andari 
4.⁠ ⁠Kadek Tomi 
5 Putu Velyn 
6 Renon Traditional Village Heads 1 
7 Renon Traditional Village Heads 2 
8.⁠ ⁠Wiwied Trisnadi 
  
Please arrive on time. 
Thank you for your presence 
 
Regards Wiwied Trisnadi 
Acting Senior Program Manager for Save the Children for the World Mosquito 
Program” 
 
After that we were told not to attend the meeting as  we were informed as follows:  
1) Imigrasi was going to arrest everyone  
2) Save The Children Fund would have organised a photographer to capture pictures 
of Gladiator Bangsa, Puskor and Bali Solidarity representatives at the meeting. 
Pictures would allow WMP to claim that the meeting had socialised the program and  
reassured the groups about the science. They might well claim that proper 
‘socialisation’ of the program had now taken place - required by the Acting Governor 
before any release.  
3) We were also told that National Security and Defence Department personnel 
would definitely attend the meeting, to clarify the risks from the mosquitoes as 
foreign biological agents.  
4) We were also told that Police Intelligence would be there as they were now in 
charge of the investigation, since we had filed charges on the 8th November and this 
was now the 10th November. in addition, the Police Biological Hazard Unit were said 
to be already at the laboratory in Denpasar seizing the mosquito eggs.  
 
Not one of the authorities actually attended the meeting or the mosquito laboratory. 
This is more untrue information and promises, made by the authorities that were 
completely false. It meant that Wiwied and his colleagues were genuinely expecting 
us and rang for the second time, still waiting for us to turn up. At that moment, I sent 
an apology and explanation I had written, alerting him to 
The Karmic Consequences of his role as Implementer. 
     
Thank you for the invitation, already 
suddenly told not to come 
meeting because of questions 
regarding safety, efficacy and legality 
His release is now in the hands of the police 
and the Department of National Security. 
The governor confirmed it directly 

that the release is discontinued and 
that its notification is supported by 
President. Have you seen the notification 
as well? 
Maybe someone from the squad 
might attend the meeting 
today, as information from 
scientists will be important to 
health and other environments 
departments and other experimental permits 
allowed, in Indonesia. 
At your meeting on Monday, that is 
determined that none of 
the participant knows that it is a mosquito 
The program launch is fully funded 
by an Australian foreign family, and 
therefore Bali's release is not a 
government program. It came to mind 
me that you're talking to us 
in the hotel reception area 
and not actually on the Stakeholders 
T Indate meetings with colleagues who may already be there 
skip the backlash against 
awareness that it may be illegal. Th 
another topic at the meeting in Monda 
is it just the Ministry of Health 
knowing about the release for several weeks 
ago. Even other ministers don't know, 
or Coordinating Committee, 
which is contrary to the 2017 law. 
You may have received the latest information 
all this but I think you, personally, 
might be used, by that 
who want the release to continue, 
to suggest that the release is a 
government program. They will 
say that you are in a 'pandemic 
readiness section below 
minister before this program, which 
you told me when we met. 
Since you introduced yourself 
for me as "Executor" on 
Monday, I realized that you are 
man to be made 
responsible for the release. "That 
executor" has been discussed 
in all previous webinars, even with 
WMP researchers and no one else would 
tell me who that person is. We have to "ask the 
Executor", "Executor is 

responsible" and responsible for the masses

you told me when we met.

11th November 2023  
Connecting the Mosquitoes Health Strategy To The WHO Agenda 
 for the Indonesian Authorities’ Understanding  
 
Significance of the Bali Mosquito Release for Indonesia’s urgent withdrawal from the 
WHO treaty,  
Immediate Action required for Hankamrata: Total people defence 
Indonesia has two choices that must be made immediately or no longer have any 
choice at all. 
 
In two days’ time 13th November 2023 there is the planned Bali Mosquito Release, 
in Denpasar and another city.  
In two weeks’ time, 1st December, the withdrawal period closes, from the World 
Health Organization’s so-called Pandemic Treaty. After that date, it would take two 
years to withdraw and it may not be legal or allowed to withdraw.  
 
The WHO Amendments will give the WHO itself legally binding authority over all 
governments; to declare a pandemic, to lock down the country, to limit the movement 
of the people, to monitor and modify the behaviour of people, to inflict economic 

collapse, debt and starvation on the people, ban Indonesia’s own medicines, ban 
access to any self-sufficient farming methods - for example rice fields, as potentially 
a breeding ground for diseases, to allocate public money to Gain of Function 
research, pharmaceutical vaccine research, mosquito factories, and give the WHO 
the exclusive right to Approve such drugs for the market, to require governments buy 
supplies of these PPE and vaccines, and put mandates and penalties in place for 
any country, or individual man or woman’s acting with any freedom, which are in 
alignment with Indonesian medicine, religion, culture, wisdom, justice, and 
infrastructure that the government deem more successful to improve and provide 
national health.  
 
After the 1st December, no world government will have any choice at all.  
Stopping the mosquito release on National Security, and Scientific grounds (as well 
as legal and political) will provide the grounds for withdrawal from the agreement 
with the WHO Amendments (and lead and support other countries to do the same). 
This would be a major legacy for this incoming government. 
 
The way to raise it to a priority politically for this election period is to ask every 
minister and candidate for a statement about the WHO amendments. 
 
It is likely that only the health minister will know and not one other minister, let alone 
the Coordination Departments, have been consulted or reached an informed 
consensus about the huge impact. On this point, that only the Health Minister was 
consulted, we can show the example of the Mass Mosquito Release, going against 
the 2017 legislation. We had to let the other ministers know, and that was after 
reading the mayor of Denpasar’s Instagram announcement just 6 weeks ago. 
 
The implications for the WHO treaty at government level, are that it will create an 
imbalance that the Ministry of Health will be much more powerful than any other 
department, and will no longer have to consult with even the ministry of defence. 
They will control the budgets and choices for all Indonesia. At the moment, if we 
discredit the actions by the minister of health as political control and financially 
motivated, as he is not a doctor, we can also question the Minister’s Pandemic 
Preparedness department and principles which are: 
 
1) Giving an unelected foreign organization (WHO) global power on totally false 
scientific grounds 2) The treatment of whole countries that are not sick. 3) 
Justification for ‘Gain of Function’ research, which involves the Public funding of 
genetic engineering of diseases, to be more fatal or virulent. Gain of Function 
research results are then not disclosed to the regulatory or environmental protection 
authorities, or available for independent testing. Instead, they are patented for the 
development of vaccines, by the pharmaceutical industry, and with-held for 
biosafety, by the military. The WHO argue that these diseases ‘could have happened 
in nature’ and they need to prepare. They use this argument for the mosquitoes as 
well saying ‘The mosquitoes will carry Wolbachia like many other insects do. These 
engineered enhancements could never have happened in nature but we have to use 
this scientific argument. 
 
Again, we can use the WMP Wolbachia Mosquito marketing strategy to demonstrate 
how the WMP and Ministry for health falsely claim the mosquitoes are ‘natural’. The 

ways that the mosquitoes are scientifically unnatural are really important. We have to 
argue the world-wide lie that has been lobbied to governments, that Gene Editing are 
different from GMO.  
 
If the government take the time now to stop all bio-technology use in Indonesia, 
pending an investigation into this claim that Gene Editing is not GMO, we will have 
saved the nation.  If we don’t, we may not get these mosquitoes but we will have to 
fight every creation presented at the AIS Technology Conference on Bali (Oct. 10th 
and 11th 2023), such as plastic and oil-eating bacteria, and carbon capture and 
storage, engineering algae that could change the algae we rely on for oxygen, and 
every other unpredictable, unsafe and inaccurate edit of Nature’s gene pool 
(microbiome), that man believes he has achieved. 
 
Specifically, to understand today, the Aedes Aegypti mosquito has been bred to 
carry Wolbachia bacteria, inoculating the mosquitoes from Dengue. The risk is that 
the diseases including Dengue will themselves mutate into more dangerous strains 
of disease to compete with the Wolbachia. And Wolbachia itself causes Filarial 
diseases and is present in fish, birds, and human parasites, as well as transmitting 
water-borne diseases - where mosquito larvae live for two weeks.    
 
One legal precedent the government could use is that Microsoft were taken to court 
in 2003 for anti-competition practices, ending in the re-marketing of technologies as 
not for profit, health strategies. 
 
Indonesia can argue that Microsoft are creating a market for their vaccines, by 
supplying technology for a built-to-fail mosquito health strategy. And then creating 
another market, for their 5G and 6G smart cities, using health-justified monitoring 
and reducing the population’s ability to live and work in the natural environment, 
justified by saying it is for their own safety and to stop the spread.   
 
(Senior WMP managers were at All Eyes On Bali summit yesterday and said they 
started releases in August in the north of Bali and there already are horrendous 
blood images and symptoms being observed, that do not test positive for Dengue or 
other familiar diseases. This could be a covert attack on Bali, which will be followed 
by Kalimantan on 12 other countries, via mosquitoes (as is stated in the WMP Scale 
UP PDF) but attack on 193 countries through the acquiescence and blind 
acceptance of the WHO amendments, via a multitude of health strategies. We need 
to find out at once, if it is only the Health Minister in each country who has been 
involved in negotiations and recommending approval of the WHO Pandemic 
Preparedness Treaty. We must tell them to appeal to all their planning legislation to 
withdraw their country’s inclusion, on grounds of the foreign-control being given 
away, the level of impact on their country, the absence of financial and scientific due 
diligence in regard to the WHO, and the absence of due planning process with all 
ministers and competent authorities. 
 
At the same time, Indonesia does not have to conflict with the super powers of other 
countries. It can withdraw and state that it wishes to be the Control Group of the 
medical experiment, which is this Global Smart Health Strategy. The mosquitoes and 
the majority of biotech for use in medicine, food, agriculture, conservation and 
military are all on an Experimental Permit of Approval. Every experiment needs a 

control group. Indonesia can prove that it can be self sufficient on all these levels, 
including the refusal of financial money for research. 
 
Indonesia can use another quantitative and quantitative methodology for measuring 
our health and quality of life and biodiversity. The case against the WHO brought by 
Indonesia’s previous Health Minister, in regard to the taking of samples to America of 
Avian Bird Flu could be used as a legal precedent. The taking of the samples was 
followed by gain of function engineering to create H5N1, which escaped from top 
security labs in America (ref. Institute For Responsible Technology White Papers 
and draft Bioweapons, Green Technology and GM Mosquitoes papers.) 
 
We must stop the idea of Indonesia’s capital being a smart city under the control of 
surveillance through American artificial intelligence. Again the mosquitoes are 
strategic for the WHO (who did the risk analysis of the releases, and found 50 
potential biohazards as ‘negligible’). The Mosquitoes will carry Wolbachia IP 
Technology, coupled with CNN Artificial Intelligence. The mosquitoes have an 
interest in human blood as they bite in order to feed and breed. The biggest business 
in the world is interested in human blood too, including DNA information, data, and 
samples. There has already been major evidence that the Covid vaccines have 
corrupted blood in a myriad of detrimental ways.   
 
All these mRNA and other biotechnologies are foreign-owned and patented with 
exclusive rights to access the data and control the equipment.  
 
In the case of the mosquitoes, a gene drive technology is irreversible but 
environmental protection agencies will not have the information on the exact gene 
sequence/strain of wolbachia or ingredients to be able to monitor the spread. The 
technology is not approved for release outside a laboratory. The World Mosquito 
Program answer. 1) It is not a gene drive but they intend for the mosquitoes to 
replace the wild mosquitoes (the exact definition of a gene drive) 2) The mosquitoes 
are harmless - this is not a scientific statement and not backed up by any scientific 
evidence) 3) The mosquitoes are natural and deny IP technology in them. This is a 
denial of the one monitoring system and control (possibly) system, of the 
mosquitoes, that Bali has. But the Minister for health has bought a license for the 
Wolbachia Technology. The investigation must include whether the minister intended 
to sell the data? Or whether he must produce the data for the foreign owner of the 
technology? Whether he intended to deny a mosquito release monitoring system, so 
that liability for damages could not be proven etc. 
 
In the case to stop the mosquito release on Monday, it has been shown that the 
program is Australian Funded, fully. It is not a government program. It is likely, 
however that the Department of Health with say that the Implementer is from the 
Department of Health and therefore it is a government program. The implementer, is 
Wiwied Trisnadi. When asked what he had worked before that prepared him to 
manage the release of 200 million mosquitoes with confidence, he said the 
Pandemic Preparedness section in the Ministry for Health. He also said that he does 
not know anything about the science behind  the mosquito method and unaware of 
any risks to environment or ecosystem. In short, if the Wolbachia is inherited or self-
replicated, they are both equally dangerous. 
 

 
12th November 2023 World Council For Health Asia Symposium 
Professors Richard Claproth, Michael Northcott and I present at first World Council 
For Health Asia Symposium - thanks to a last minute cancellation. 
Bali resists technocratic ‘solutions’ … again 
The World Council for Health’s Asia Symposium, hosted by Reverend Doctor Wai-
Ching Lee and Marivic Villa MD, was held on 10-12 November 2023. Toward the end 
of the final day of the symposium, an emergency panel was constituted to alert 
participants to the release, scheduled for the following day, of 200 million mosquito 
eggs on the island of Bali by the World Mosquito Program (WMP). Since then, and 
thanks to a courageous campaign driven by people including members of the panel, 
this release was halted at the last minute by the Indonesian government. This 
appears to be a temporary reprieve, but it provides time and a sense of urgency to 
expose more widely the releases of engineered mosquitoes taking place in many 
tropical regions of the world. 
What are Wolbachia mosquitoes? 
The engineered mosquitoes that have already been investigated and released 
elsewhere in Indonesia are no ordinary mosquitoes. The WMP website is at pains to 
declare that they are not genetically modified. But they are also not – in contradiction 
to what the WMP asserts – ‘natural’. These ‘Wolbachia mosquitoes’, are created in 
the laboratory by micro-injecting Wolbachia bacteria into the eggs and sperm of 
Aeodes aegypti (Ae. aegypti) mosquitoes, which do not normally contain these 
bacteria.  
So, what is the point of releasing Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes in Bali, and five 
other Indonesian cities, namely Semarang, Jakarta Barat, and Bandung on the 
island of Jakarta; Kupang in West Timor; and Bontang in East Kalimantan?  
The initiative aims to deploy these mosquitoes to reduce the incidence of dengue 
haemorrhagic fever and other mosquito-borne diseases in Indonesia. Indeed, the 
WMP has been collaborating with Universitas Gadjah Mada in Yogyakarta since 
2012 and completed a three-year randomised controlled trial using the Wolbachia 
method in 2020. An article in the New England Journal of Medicine declared a 77% 
reduction in the incidence of dengue in areas treated with Wolbachia compared with 
untreated areas. 
The WMP’s work is based on research conducted by Monash University in Australia, 
which showed that when Ae. aegypti mosquitoes are infected with Wolbachia 
bacteria, they lose the ability to transmit viruses responsible for tropical diseases 
such as dengue, Zika, chikungunya, and yellow fever. They have since deployed 
these mosquitoes in a number of regions, including northern Australia; Yogyakarta 
and the Sleman and Bantul districts of the Indonesian island of Jakarta; Brazil, 
Vietnam, Columbia, and Sri Lanka, among others. 
In Indonesia, the original Australian Wolbachia mosquitoes were crossed with 
mosquitoes from Yogyakarta prior to the first release to ensure that they were 
genetically matched to local mosquito populations. Wolbachia is transmitted from 
parent to offspring via the egg, and it is these infected eggs that are released into the 
environment. When they hatch, these mosquitoes breed with the local mosquitoes. 
Over generations the numbers of mosquitoes infected with Wolbachia steadily 
increase until the percentage of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes is so high that no 
further releases are required. 
So far, so good, it appears.  
So why the urgent meeting? 

 
Around the world there are countless examples of enthusiastically implemented 
novel technologies that have backfired badly, resulting in unintended but devastating 
outcomes for people, nature, and local economies. 
Michael Northcott, Professor Emeritus of Ethics at the University of Edinburgh, and 
Adjunct Professor at Universitas Gadjah Mada, warned about the dangers of forcing 
international technical ‘solutions’ on countries without humbly recognising the 
wisdom of cultural practices that have evolved over centuries in response to local 
ecologies. He shared the story of the Bali Irrigation Project, a Green Revolution 
initiative during the 1970s and ’80s. Swiss agricultural engineers and Jakarta 
agricultural bureaucrats forced Balinese rice farmers to abandon centuries-old 
temple-governed traditions of rice growing and irrigation known as ‘Subak’. Using 
regulations and fines, farmers were coerced into planting fast-growing rice hybrids 
and ignoring the advice of the temple priests on sharing water. Ironically, instead of 
achieving the goal of improving agricultural productivity, the disruption of local 
traditions resulted in pest plagues and droughts. The engineers doubled down, 
introducing pest-resistant hybrid seeds, more agrochemicals, and even cement 
weirs. They dismissed what they considered a ‘rice cult’ as religious conservatism 
and superstition.  
 
It was only once Balinese academics and a visiting anthropologist intervened that the 
engineers and bureaucrats could be persuaded that traditional methods were in fact 
superior to their scientific techniques. They left widespread damage in their wake, 
but this failed intervention revealed the wisdom of a tradition in which the spiritual, 
ecological, and cultural facets of life were seamlessly interwoven. As Prof. Northcott 
observed, “The engineers knew nothing of the evolved ways in which the culture and 
religion of Bali distributed the water on Bali, sustained co-operation between farmers, 
and also controlled pests.”  
While there are many differences between the current release of Wolbachia 
mosquitoes and the Bali Irrigation Project, it is worth asking: Have we not learnt the 
lessons of the Green Revolution? And are we about to see history repeating itself in 
Indonesia? Let’s consider some of the reasons why people are concerned, despite 
assurances on WMP’s website that the Wolbachia method is “non-GMO, safe for 
humans, animals, and ecology … [and] effective, with long-term sustainable 
solutions to dengue.” 
What are the risks? 
 
 
• 
Threats to Health: 
Prof. Richard Claproth has a PhD in Earth Sciences and Economics and worked in 
the Indonesian government for 35 years where he held various ministerial positions. 
Since then, he has had a healing practice, drawing on approaches such as Rife and 
quantum healing, and during the Covid-19 event he developed effective ways to treat 
the condition. He has deep concerns about the release of Wolbachia mosquitoes, 
seeing this as an experiment being carried out on the Indonesian people that may 
have dire consequences for health. In a recent interview on DIO-TV.com, he went as 
far as to suggest that the release of millions of Wolbachia mosquitoes on the island 
of Bali is tantamount to biological warfare [perang biologi].  
One of Prof. Claproth’s main concerns is that the reasons for selecting Bali were 
clearly specified in the project objectives. Curiously, dengue is not actually a serious 
problem on the island. Where deaths due to dengue fever are concerned, Bali does 

not appear in lists of the top ten Indonesian regions or cities affected and in fact 
experienced only ten out of a total of 1,014 dengue-related deaths during the first 47 
weeks of 2022. Regarding the two release areas chosen, the number of cases has 
decreased significantly in Buleleng, and there was no available data for Denpasar, 
making monitoring of efficacy unrealistic. On the other hand, the 14 districts where 
dengue has shifted in status from sporadic to endemic within a three-year period 
were not prioritised for Wobachia mosquito control.  
Prof. Claproth also noted that the Indonesian government had managed to get 
dengue fever under control by implementing five public health programmes, namely 
ongoing vector management; accessible management of cases; effective 
surveillance and response to outbreaks; community engagement; and government 
commitment to effective policies, programmes, and partnerships. 
While case numbers fluctuated greatly from year to year (notably in response to El 
Niño events), the actual percentage case fatality rate had remained very low in the 
past few decades (Figure 1). 
He feared, however, that the shift in focus to the Wolbachia programme might 
detract from well-established protocols that were working, in favour of a relatively 
unproven approach that might introduce new risks. 
 
Figure 1: Incidence rate (per 100,000 person-years), and case fatality rate (%) of 
dengue haemorrhagic fever in Indonesia (1968-2017). 
Graphs of the incidence rate (number of cases) and case fatality rate (number of 
deaths) for the period 1968-2022 show that, although case numbers fluctuate from 
year to year, deaths have declined and remained at very low levels. Established 
methods of prevention and treatment have proven effective, and dengue fever is not 
considered a particularly dangerous disease in Indonesia. 
 
Prof. Claproth and Prof. Northcott also pointed out concerns relating to previous 
releases of Wolbachia mosquitoes. In the case of Sri Lanka, two years after their 
release by WMP, Columbo experienced a tripling of dengue cases (61,000 reported 
so far in 2023) and a larvae crisis. Despite this being reported in the media, WMP 
continued to report that the Sri Lanka release was a success. Also, Singapore has 
recorded a doubling of dengue infections since their Wolbachia release. 
In the Yogyakarta trial, data anomalies were observed in areas chosen by the WMP, 
with an unexplained doubling of dengue cases in 2010 and 2015 before the release 
of Wolbachia mosquitoes in 2011 and 2016. Some are suspicious that this might 
have been caused by the withdrawal of normal management protocols prior to the 
releases, making the decline in cases due to the Wolbachia programme appear 
more significant than it actually was.  
Furthermore, as shown in Figure 2, the 2016 release in Yogyakarta was followed by 
another large increase in dengue cases in 2019. This is inconsistent with claims in 
the New England Journal of Medicine article of a 77% reduction in cases. Indications 
of significant increases in both Ae. aegypti larvae and dengue cases after release of 
Wolbachia mosquitoes should be investigated before any more releases are 
permitted.  
 
 
Figure 2: Dengue case data in the Special Region of Yogyakarta for the last ten 
years until the 47th week of 2022 (Presentation: Update on the Activities of the 
Wolbachia Implementation Pilot Project. Ministry of Health, Republic of Indonesia, 1 

December 2022)  
 
The public is generally unaware of these spikes in dengue cases in Wolbachia trial 
areas because the WMP, supported by the BMGF and its slick public relations 
operation, floods the web-scape with stories of unmitigated successes and images of 
delighted people (most often dressed in blue, in keeping with the colour of the WMP 
brand) fanning their hands like pairs of mosquito wings. Curiously, despite their 
university roots and partnerships, there is little rigorous data or analysis to be found 
on the WMP website. 
 
2. Threats to Ecosystems: 
WMP scientists claim that Wolbachia mosquitoes are ‘natural’ but, of course, they 
are not, as Ae. aegypti mosquitoes do not normally contain Wolbachia bacteria. The 
WMP aims to replace indigenous mosquitoes in their programme areas with these 
engineered mosquitoes, which essentially function as a pesticide. We do not know 
the long-term consequences of creating a monoculture of engineered mosquitoes in 
these areas. Furthermore, it appears that no ecological impact assessments have 
been conducted in Bali; these should be essential in order to mitigate potential 
negative consequences on the ecosystem.  
 
3. Threats to Tourism:  
We have already questioned why, as Bali is not a dengue hotspot, it was chosen as 
a release site by the WMP. Prof. Northcott speculates that, as one of the top tourist 
destinations in the world, Bali is a useful ‘poster child’ to publicise the work of the 
WMP:  
The BMGF are extremely good at marketing and this is the reason for the focus on 
Bali. It has nothing to do with health. Ten deaths at most last year from 
haemorrhagic dengue fever in Bali does not require $1 billion of public investment in 
genetically engineered mosquitoes to put right. 
Ironically, if the Bali project does go ahead, worldwide publicity about mosquito 
releases might contribute to the island’s undoing as a tourist destination. 
Prior to the Covid lockdowns, tourism contributed nearly five percent to Indonesia’s 
GDP, with Bali being the major source. The lockdowns devastated tourism, having a 
massive impact on the economy and on the lives and livelihoods of those dependent 
on the industry. Since the country reopened its borders, tourism has been 
recovering, but it cannot afford another shock. And releasing engineered mosquitoes 
in Bali could just represent this shock. 
In Florida and California in the USA, where many people are aware of the dangers of 
GMOs, similar mosquito programmes have been shut down due to the public’s 
concerns about health and safety. Many international travellers are environmentally 
aware and if they hear of the release of engineered mosquitoes they may be 
deterred from visiting Bali and other parts of Indonesia.  
Another suspicion, fuelled by the Covid event, is that the Wolbachia mosquitoes may 
have been engineered using ‘gain-of-function’ technology to transmit diseases other 
than dengue. Just as international travel was blamed for the spread of SARS-CoV-2, 
Bali might represent the perfect hub from which to spread the next ‘pandemic’. 
 
4. Gene drives and the risks of genetic engineering:  
A gene drive is a genetic engineering technology that propagates a particular suite of 
genes throughout a population by altering the probability that a specific allele will be 

transmitted to the offspring. According to this definition, the process of manufacturing 
Wolbachia mosquitoes represents a gene drive. These lab-engineered mosquitoes 
contain specific strains of Wolbachia bacteria that were never previously present in 
Ae. aegypti. And according to Prof. Northcott, these bacteria have been genetically 
modified to express particular characteristics using techniques associated with 
CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing.  
There have been gene drives in other parts of the world that have used different 
mosquito technologies with disastrous consequences. Gene drives in Florida, New 
York City, and Brazil have led to outbreaks of infant encephalitis, as well as Zika in 
Brazil. Malaria has been recorded for the first time in 100 years in New York City, 
and Zika was recorded in Florida where it had never existed before.  
Releasing any GMO into the environment is inherently risky as the outcomes are 
completely unpredictable. In such a situation, the precautionary principle should 
apply.  
 
The root of the problem 
The WMP’s now-postponed Bali programme feels in many ways like a reincarnation 
of the Bali Irrigation Project of the 1970s and ’80s. Once again, a well-funded 
development organisation arrives in a so-called ‘developing country’ armed with a 
charitable-sounding agenda, novel technologies, and a project plan. While most of 
the project team believe that they are ‘doing good’, something about the way in 
which the project is implemented just doesn’t ring true.  
Here are some of the discordant notes that have concerned those who care about 
the health, dignity, and sovereignty of the people of Indonesia: 
Normal procedures were flouted 
WMP and their partner Save the Children appear to have flouted normal procedures 
when establishing the Bali project. While WMP signed an agreement with the 
Indonesian Ministry of Health in December 2022, this was the only national 
department consulted. They were not granted permission by the National 
Coordination Authority in Jakarta, meaning that the project contravened Government 
regulations on new species and health interventions. 
A representative from Save the Children informed one of the panel members 
investigating the mosquito project that they had not received official permission from 
either the Governor's office or the Acting Governor representing the Province of Bali. 
They had only obtained permission from the Mayor of Denpasar and consulted with 
members of the communities targeted for mosquito release, to whom they had 
promoted the benefits of the project.  
Concerns have been raised in many countries about the undue influence of Bill 
Gates on national governments. In fact, Indonesia’s Minister of Health entered into a 
partnership with BMGF to transform the country’s health system. As Prof. Claproth 
observed, “It is absurd that a Minister appointed by the President could work with a 
private foundation to develop national health policy.” This non-disclosure agreement 
with the BMGF has not been published, and neither Parliament nor the people have 
been appraised of its contents. Recognising that BMGF is a major funder of WMP, 
could the Foundation’s agreement with the Health Minister have enabled the WMP to 
initiate projects without permission from the National Coordination Authority? 
While the Indonesian Government generally funds development projects, two of the 
seven cities in Bali where the mosquito releases were planned to take place were 
instead financed by an Australian NGO, meaning that this was not truly a national 
programme.  

As with the Swiss engineers decades ago who dismissed the authority of the 
Balinese temple priests and traditions that had sustained the Subak culture, today’s 
powerful philanthropists and NGOs also appear to be disregarding the sovereignty, 
structures, and procedures of the nations they purport to assist. 
Why does nobody know?  
As the date of the first release of mosquitoes on the island of Bali approached, it was 
shocking to discover how few government officials and members of the public were 
aware that this was happening. There had been no attempt to consult the broader 
community beyond the target populations. Even spiritual leaders, people involved in 
tourism, and politicians were completely uninformed. One wonders if the 
‘consultation’ process was really designed to obtain consent, or simply to promote 
the project and educate those community members who would be used to distribute 
the mosquito eggs. 
Intellectual property rights v. due diligence  
An organisation that sets out to release 200 million engineered mosquito eggs on a 
small island, with little idea of their potential impact, can certainly not be said to have 
conducted due diligence. Based on limited pilot testing, the WMP insists that 
Wolbachia mosquitoes must be released in Bali, and that the programme must be 
rolled out nationwide and ultimately globally, at a vast cost of between four and nine 
billion dollars.  
Yet, because the ingredients engineered into these mosquitoes are patented, 
citizens and government officials in the target countries have no right to know what 
these insect vectors may introduce into their bodies and local ecosystems. Keeping 
the gene sequences secret means that independent monitoring of the spread and 
impact of these mosquitoes is limited because they cannot be tested for in drinking 
water or in human and animal blood. 
Who is accountable?  
In the face of the secrecy and lack of broad consultation around the release of 
Wolbachia mosquitoes the question must be asked: Who is responsible if something 
goes wrong resulting in dire consequences? Can the government of Indonesia hold 
the WMP and their funders financially accountable? If a devastating new infectious 
disease emerges once this genie is out of its bottle, will this result in another major 
windfall for the pharmaceutical industry, but leave taxpayers footing the bill? And if 
potential tourists choose another destination due to fears of being attacked by 
engineered mosquitoes, what might be the impact on a region that relies on tourism 
revenues? 
 
Speculation in a low-trust world 
The problem with a lack of transparency and accountability is that it breeds suspicion 
and speculation. Since 2020, levels of mistrust of governments, agencies, 
corporations, foundations, and supra-national bodies like WHO and the WEF have 
risen dramatically – and for good reason. Knowing that major funders of the WMP 
include players like BMGF, Wellcome, and USAID raises concerns in the minds of 
those jaded by much delving into globalist agendas. 
Beyond concerns about the obvious negative impacts that the release of Wolbachia 
mosquitoes could have on human and environmental health, questions arise about 
more sinister reasons for this often unprocedural, secretive, and over-confidently 
promoted public health intervention.  
Panel member Frances Micklem, a researcher who focuses on a wide range of 
biosafety issues, has exposed references to the role of mosquitoes in bioweapons 

research, and the manipulation of Wolbachia mosquitoes to carry Internet Protocol 
Technology that can be used to receive and transmit data. She observes that, “All 
these health strategies are basically biotech products that have found a way into our 
countries on the basis of very dubious regulation, and that will have very wide 
impact.” Frances located the WMP programme within WHO’s broader, deeply 
concerning power grab that is rapidly taking shape with scant resistance from 
nations or individuals. 
 
Working together for a Better Way 
Already activists in Bali have achieved their most urgent goal, halting the release of 
Wolbachia mosquitoes scheduled for 13 November 2023. This allows time to 
campaign for a complete cancellation of the programme. Releases continue in other 
parts of Indonesia, however, and these must also be halted and the entire 
programme subjected to in-depth due diligence. There must be full transparency, 
with all government departments and the public being informed and involved in 
deciding whether or not to give consent. 
The campaign to halt the mosquito release has created widespread awareness 
about the dark side of this programme, to the dismay of those who assumed that it 
was a done deal. Open discussions about all potential threats—whether to human 
health, ecosystem integrity, economic wellbeing, national security, or sovereignty—
must be encouraged. And threats that are identified must be investigated.  
As happened in Bali in the 1980s, it is time for the people to simply say “No!” There 
is growing awareness that there is a much better way. Many in Bali and around the 
world are recognising that our nations do not need foreign philanthropy if it means 
having to accept inadequately tested technologies, or external control over our 
healthcare choices. It is time to honour that which is authentically ours, including the 
wisdom and integrity of our diverse traditions.  
In her presentation, Frances shared her vision for a way to graciously opt out of the 
public health ‘solution’ threatening Bali. She reminded us that every experiment 
requires a Control Group – in other words, a comparative group not exposed to the 
experimental intervention. What if Bali could be the control group in the region? Over 
the coming years, free of engineered mosquitoes and continuing with the public 
health programmes that have resulted in low levels of mortality due to dengue fever, 
the relevant government departments could document how well the province fared in 
meeting the Sustainable Development Goals relating to health, agriculture, 
conservation, and economic wellbeing.  
It’s an exciting vision, a return to sovereignty, and in Bali not unprecedented.  
 
21.11.23 - Meeting the next deadline: To Reject the International Health Regulation 
Amendments before the end of November (ie. within 18 months of the 2022 World 
Health Assembly) 
 
Letter to the Head of State of all the United Nations Member States and their heads 
of Defense, identifying their Health Minister and mentioning how their National 
Security is about to pass to the WHO and full control of their budget and economy 
will pass to their WHO delegate, as Health Ministers will have first dibs on all public, 
‘green’ and pandemic fund money to fulfil their nation’s new obligations to the WHO.  
I added a template rejection letter, composed by James Roguski, a dedicated 
analyst of the WHO IHR Amendments and Treaty. 
 

I shared these documents and body of work with the World Council For Health: 
 
“Please find to follow the research pack to send to your WCH partners, both who are 
facing GM mosquitoes or producing them. I have cc'd  the General who has been so 
attentitve to the threat of bioagents being brought in like this, to the chief of Bali 
Province police as he opened the investigation, the High Prosecutor, and Maurice 
Slangan who is a lawyer who I think understands the Central Indonesia Government 
and Dr Siti Fadillah who has been asked by the World Council for Health to speak 
soon at one of the meetings.     
  
I am writing to countries' Heads of state who are threatened with mosquitoes, next, 
but I've written to all the Arabic heads of state today (listed in the WHO page below) 
about the 1st December deadline to reject the IHR Amendments. My letter starts 
after the world health organization link and after this introduction! 
 
In addition to raising awareness about the dangers of mosquitoes and the WHO, I 
think it is important to send this body of work to the authorities, we've been in contact 
with and taken an interest and helped with the postponement of the Bali Mosquito 
Release. We are obviously hoping for a serious response, like the complete 
termination of the mosquito program and serious repercussions for the supposedly 
charitable organizations that nearly deployed the eggs in homes in Bali homes on 
the 13th November 2023. There are also a lot of great articles now that do raise the 
alarm but for a few days, there was nothing said apart from new articles promoring 
the mosquito release by the Deputy Mayor of Denpasar, and radio silence from 
everyone else.    
 
I attach the all-important Resignation Letter from the top UN director and the all-
important exact letter from the 11 countries who withdrew from the WHO Treaty 
altogether. Other countries can now copy and paste what they want from it,  if WCH 
can send it out to their partners.  
 
I also attach a few of Richard's videos if you could maybe download them so that Dr 
Wai Ching can translate them and disseminate them as a transcript or with a voice 
over in English so more countries will understand how they can stop mosquitoes, 
withdraw from the World Health Organization and NGO's and eventually file charges, 
like we did in Bali.  
 
In the letters I sent today to Heads of State (as you know, it only takes one formal 
letter from the head of state to stop the WHO), I have done a google translate  into 
Arabic mainly or whatever country is spoken in each country but below is the simple 
version, in English.  
 
In addition, I have attached the 'Mosquitoes From A Microbial Perspective' Draft 
White Paper,  'Bioweapons' Draft White Paper and 'Green Technology' White Paper 
notes and references.  
 
And of course the Due Diligence Questions talked about on the meeting last night. 
One question that no one has been willing to answer is, Who Is liable?  
 
And that is a parallel for the WHO: They are unelected, unaccountable and enjoy 

Diplomatic Immunity as they are based in Geneva. They will not be liable for the 
repurcussions of their pandemic preparedness strategies however many adverse 
events. 
 
 The mosquito release in Bali with no planning or regulatory oversight is explained in 
a global context for what will happen if heads of state do not reject the amendments 
to the International Health Regulations before the 1st December 2021. Governments 
will have no choice or opoortunity to refuse a WHO strategy of any kind, from 
mosquito, to lockdown, to vaccination, after this deadline. He emphasizes that no 
government can ignore this. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eh30cThhVm0 
 
If you simply forward this email pack of some of the work we did in Bali to address 
the mosquito release, it will probably go to your partners in Asia and Africa first and 
then the rest of the world. My hope is that they might be able to directly write to their 
heads of state, quoting some Constitutional Law that would be broken by all 
government powers be handed to the WHO, but whatever happens, it is really a 
speak now or forever hold your peace situation. Any letter is better than no letter. 
Thank you! 
 
If not now, when? 
If not us, who? 
 
In addition, just now this evening as I put these reports and communication and 
strategies together to see if they can help other countries, I've heard from ⁨Deva 
Satriya Nusantara, Puskor Hindunesia, who we are pictured with, with the Governor 
of Bali, at his house, where we were invited straight after filing charges with the 
police. We were given tea and cake and heralded as real life heroes and lovers of 
Bali. The Governor sent Deva Satriya Nusantara a comprehensive letter the next 
day, 9th November, outlining how he understood the many dangers of a mosquito 
release to human health, ecology, economy and all without any consultation. He 
confirmed that the President endorse his notice that no release should take place 
until all those risks were addressed. Today (12 days later), though, he sent photos of 
mosquitoes where there were other releases mentioned, but not publicly confirmed. 
The message read, 
 
I think we need to go back to the police station and demand answers. They haven’t 
stopped anything, they haven’t confiscated any buckets. Weird Mosquitoes are being 
seen around Uluwatu and Seminyak, and people are getting sick with a strange new 
illness that’s similar to Dengue. Numbers with hospitals are still rising. We are given 
lip service that this has stopped and it’s not".  
 
So, you can see the challenges remain, and already new diseases that do not test 
positive for Dengue. This will be important when Margaret shares her work, next 
time, on the unsatisfactory testing WMP did to arrive at their great trial data of over 
70% success.  
 
So, I am hoping that the sharing of these detailed concerns internationally will  
inspire Indonesia to lead the way out from under the tyranny of criminal 
organizations and corrupt departments masquerading as being in public service and 
not for profit. 

 
 
Heads of State I've written to so far.  
https://www.emro.who.int/countries.html 
 
 
These are links for the scientific information delivered by WMP but number 5 keeps 
getting taken down from one platform: 
https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsujNC4b3bB0cryJ5OXMjTfAQt6VsfLhI&si=JeBrts
3ArN5LOTxx 
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8pjm8LTcmo 
 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XljQOOFV3RY 
 
I have also attached a drafted letter, English version, to Indonesia's Head of State 
President Joko Widodo, whose son has confirmed that he will definitely get him to 
read it and acknowledge the ramifications of the WHO and IHR agreements. It might 
be a good generic outline of the upcoming WHO deadline, for other countries but 
obviously originally it was in Bahasa Indonesia. I will get the writers to send that on 
actually. 
 
As far as I know, a powerful letter, I think including both the Mosquito precedent as a 
case, and the immediate need to reject the IHR Amendments to retain Indonesia's 
sovereignty of government decision making from the WHO has already been 
delivered. I believe it was delivered to the Chiefs of Police and the President but I'm 
not sure.  
 
Everyone is concerned that just because there is a postponement, thank God, in 
Denpasar, there are plenty of other places who have been subjected to and are 
about to be subjected to mass releases. And we are all well aware that if the 
President does not reject the Amendments, Indonesia will have no choice, planning 
power or regulatory oversight of any technology that the WHO dictate.  
 
It is more worrying In a way, now we know that it is not even an innocent well-meant 
mosquito release, with unknown, unpredictable and unintended consequences. The 
WMP's own scientists have agreed that there are known, predictable and intended 
consquences, including introducing more dangerous species and higher levels of 
sickness.  
 
Next is today's letter I drafted to Heads of State - slightly different to the one I shared 
yesterday but as I said, any letter would be good and both have the template 
addressed to the WHO. if many registered Traditional and Natural Health 
Organizations and other expert medical groups petition their Heads of State, they 
might be galvinized into action.  
 
For the urgent attention of (name of Head of State). Before December 1, 2023, 
please reject the World Health Organization's International Health Regulations 
Amendments, which will secretly claim sovereignty and government decision-making 
in (the country;s name) and in every country, on the grounds that it is for 'global 
health'. (country's name) was represented in the World Health Assembly (WHO & 

United Nations) in Geneva by (Health Minister's name)i, as (country's) Minister for 
Health. He may be complicit as government health ministries have received huge 
sums of money called 'Pandemic Funds' to implement the WHO's dangerous health 
strategies. I hope though that your  Minister for Health has made you aware of this 
deadline of the 1st December to reject the IHR Amendments.  
 
The National Bio-Security Department, in Indonesia, investigated and stopped the 
release of genetically modified mosquitoes on grounds of it turning out to be a 
foreign agency, deploying potential bioweapons. This was after police charges were 
filed, and the WHO's health strategies were called into question, as the health 
strategies are more likely to lead to  genocide, global surveillance and control.  
 
Every country has an experience of how the WHO handled the pandemic and I 
noticed that (country) is currently allowing a first vaccine and or mosquito factory, 
which could contaminate the whole population and may intend to.  
 
The WHO's deadly power-grab please must be addressed and stopped decisively. I 
enclose below the text for the formal letter you would need to send to the WHO 
before the 1st December to save (country).  
 
I also enclose the letter to the United Nations that you, as Head of State, could also 
send, withdrawing from the International Health Regulations and the WHO Pandemic 
Treaty, as was sent by 11 countries. The letter states that the United Nations are 
only pretending that Member States have adopted the UN's new legally-binding 
WHO Treaty and Amendments to the International Health Regulations when, in fact, 
it is the opposite: There is no consensus and there has been no consultation.  
 
The other letter document is a recent resignation letter from a senior UN official.  
 
The government of Indonesia would both welcome and offer  support in 
understanding the process of withdrawing from the WHO, as they currently urge 
Indonesia's President to act and reject the WHO IHR Amendments and Treaty, in an 
act of spiritual unity. Email  KODIM Colonel Inf Dody Triyo Hadi

Notice to agent is notice to principal. Notice to principal is notice to agent. 
 
Dear Director-General Ghebreyesus, 
 
This letter is to inform you of my rejection of the amendments to the International 
Health Regulations that were adopted by the 75th World Health Assembly on May 
27, 2022. Articles 59 and 61 of the International Health Regulations clearly specify 
that  amendments may be rejected within 18 months of formal notification of their 
adoption.  
 
I hereby REJECT these amendments and challenge the legitimacy of their purported 
adoption due to the fact that they were submitted in violation of Article 55 of the 
International Health Regulations. 
 
These amendments were first submitted to the World Health Assembly on May 24, 
2022 by Australia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Colombia, the European Union and its 
Member States, Japan, Monaco, the Republic of Korea, the  United Kingdom of 
Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America. 
 
https://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA75/A75_ACONF7-en.pdf 
 
The submission of these proposed amendments during the 75th World Health 
Assembly was in clear violation of Article 55, Section 2 of the International Health 
Regulations which states: 
 
“The text of any proposed amendment shall be communicated to all States Parties 
by the Director-General at least four months before the Health Assembly at which it 
is proposed for consideration.”

(Acting in the capacity of Head Of 
State)

This was sent to around 500 EU government ministers". 
Last Chance to Avert an International Emergency 
 
We humbly appeal to you, (Mr Božinovic), to ask your Head of State, to avert this 
international security emergency. 
 
After the 1st December 2023, full control of your nation’s biosecurity and resources 
will pass to the World Health Organization. You can stop this if you act now before 
1st December. Please see template withdrawal/rejection letter at the end of this 
message. 
 
After that date, WHO’s Health Strategies will become International law. The WHO is 
an unelected, unaccountable organization which has negotiated unimaginably 
dangerous amendments to the International Health Regulations (2005) and 
Pandemic Treaty with your Health Minister/WHO delegate. 
 
Perhaps this was done without informing you or your Defence Department about the 
misplaced power given to the WHO. Claims about the benefits of the amendments 
are often contradicted in the small print and are highly detrimental to your country. 
But you have the power to stop them. 
 
Please watch this 6-minute video of a Swiss international lawyer, Philipp Kruse, 
speaking at the European Parliament on 15 July 2023. He explains the dangers of 
the World Health Organisation's amendments to the International Health Regulations 
which will overrule the constitution of any signatory country to the WHO and replace 
it with a totalitarian system of world control - unless action is taken.

The New Zealand government and several other countries have said NO to the IHR 
amendments before 1 December 2023.  See the template letter at the end of this 
email. 
International lawyer, Philipp Kruse, says that the changes taking place at the WHO 
will have the following drastic totalitarian consequences: 
 
WHO policies will become mandatory and will overrule national constitutions and 
there will be no Human Rights. 
The WHO will be the sole institution worldwide with the power to define the truth in 
health matters and censorship. [This is profoundly unscientific as the scientific 
method requires claims to be challenged. One can’t create an accurate consensus 

by silencing dissent.] 
There will be no mechanism of correction, if health measures do more harm than 
good.   
The implication of national constitutions being suspended is that when the WHO 
deems it to be necessary, they will have legal control of the military and police forces 
in member states, rather than those countries’ own governments. They would be 
under no obligation to return that control. Other organisations are also concerned. 
 
Please look out for a second email from us with more detailed information from 
international lawyer, Philipp Kruse. 
 
You may like to use the TEMPLATE LETTER 
adapted from Estonia’s withdrawal: 
 
Estonia notifies WHO that it rejects the Pandemic Treaty 
 
Appeal to Honorable Dr Tedros Adhadnom Ghebreyeses 
 
Hereby the Republic of _____ on the basis of Article 22 of the Constitution of the 
World Health Organization declares that it rejects and does not consent to the 
international agreement on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response, as 
well as complementary Amendments to the International Health Regulations (2005) 
and improving the sustainability of financing WHO. 
 
The Reasons for rejecting and not consenting are the following. According to our 
Constitution, treaties are only ratified and denounced by our full government, which 
has not passed such a resolution. 
 
Taking into account, if necessary, any resolution which authorised another 
committee to negotiate on our behalf, on the international agreement on pandemic 
preparedness, prevention and response, as well as complementary Amendments to 
the International Health Regulations (2005) and on improving the sustainability of 
financing of WHO, is therefore null and void. 
 
Any Resolution is null and void from the moment of its adoption, in the light of this 
not passing before the full government.

25th November 2023 Biodefense update: 
The Realization that the Military have to be stopped for their war crimes but also for 
the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, through DARPA, connected to the 
Mosquitoes and other laboratories and un-regulated through the EPA too by, for 
example: 
 
Anthony Ruggiero  
Wrote this article claiming mis-information (just like Denpasar Implementer Chairman 
(Wiwied) and Manager (Becky) described the request for Due Diligence. 

Anthony Ruggiero’s career was from EPA (see if he was the one who re-categorized 
mosquitoes from health and control of diseases to under EPA regulation as 
‘pesticides’ 
Then made Director of Biodefence and Non-proliferation (to stop laboratories or 
individuals engineering bioweapons in large amounts) -Offensive 
Now has been made director of Counter-proliferation. Which is the project of 
engineering bioweapons in large amounts to counter/defend against an attack - 
Defensive. 
Every mosquito, including Denpasar’s is a proliferation, a mass production, of 
biological organisms that could be deployed by a bad agent. 
In this case, the implementers of the release are the bad agents; telling ministers, 
governing bodies, regulatory authorities, local governments, and the public that this 
is a government project and strategy. Yesterday at the meeting of the following 
attendees, it came to light that the release is completely foreign-funded by Australia’s 
Gillespie family. The IP Technology belongs to Australian WMP founder “Wolbachia 
technology was discovered by the Founder and Director of WMP Global, Prof. Scott 
O'Neill in 2008” https://fkkmk.ugm.ac.id/wolbachias-technological-innovation-

Deputy Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs and National Security 
Council (NSC) Senior Director for Counterproliferation and Biodefense.  Anthony 
Ruggiero advised the President, National Security Advisor, Deputy National Security 
Advisor, and White House leadership on a wide range of issues, including 
counterproliferation, weapons of mass destruction terrorism, non-proliferation, export 
controls, conventional arms transfers, biodefense, arms control, chemical weapons 
use in Syria, proliferation issues in Iran and the Democratic People’s Republic of 
Korea (DPRK), Ebola outbreaks in Africa, and the COVID-19 pandemic and 
investigation into COVID-19 origins.  Before being promoted to Senior Director for 
Counterproliferation and Biodefense, Anthony served as the NSC Director for North 
Korea.

There was another article yesterday claiming that Bill Gates had dropped Malaria-
infected mosquitoes as a bioweapon on Russian troops. All the countries that have 
resisted the WHO and the biotechnology have received retaliations of this sort. 
 
23rd November 2023 - 10 video evidence of Genocide complicity 
Plenty of Witnesses available to Richard Claproth’s 10 videos on his meeting with 
World Mosquito Program scientists that confirmed genocide, before they were 
deleted. I sent a private link to 5 lawyers and to Childrens Health Defense: 
Prof. Richard Claproth met two top scientists from the World Mosquito Program and 
learnt how releases create a spike in another population, the Culex mosquito that 
transmits Encephalitis. It is confirmed that 5 children got it, four are critical and one 
died, and they made the quick decision to vaccinate everyone under 15. Thankfully it 
was stopped. Obviously after the WHO comes into power, there will be no more 
refusing their health strategies, mosquito, vaccine or mandates. I think he confirms 
11 other viruses that come in on the back of the Wolbachia Mosquitoes, and two 

further species, one that carries FIlarial Disease (caused by Wolbachia) and one 
species that creates its own raft to carry its eggs and float them on water.  
 
There are protocols in the UK about export and import and release, such as no 
closer than 500ft from a watercourse, you could enlist GeneWatch UK to argue the 
lack of regulation, ETC Jim Thomas to explain how the mosquitoes are a gene drive 
(Gene drives have not been approved for open air release yet) , and Jeffrey Smith of 
Institute for responsible technology to explain the legislative challenges of gene 
editing.  
 
Also, i read that Merck were donating 100 million doses of Ivermectin to Africa, which 
seems like it might be connected to the release of mosquitoes as wolbachia lives in 
human, fish, bird parasites and is described in some papers as making tropical 
diseases disabling to whole populations. I don't know if the scientists explained 
whether it was in antibiotic culture that the mosquitoes were inseminated but even if 
the diseases are cured, and the parasite (round worm) burden killed, the wolbachia 
itself falls back into the body and is extremely dangerous and sometimes fatal. The 
Gain of Function, Legislative Report, Challenges of genetically engineering microbes 
are all on ProtectNatureNow site from the Institute For Responsible Technology.  I 
have the GM Mosquito and Green technology draft papers that demonstrate the 
breadth of the genocide that  these non-profit making organizations could 
intentionally or unintentionally bring.  
 
I believe that the Head of State in each country will be shocked to find out how their 
health minister represented them in Geneva last year, as happened with Indonesia.  
 
I have the bioweapons and nonproliferation of bioweapons understanding and even 
the counter proliferation of bioweapons that I discovered recently to justify more 
publicly funded research no doubt. I think I will find and send on the information 
about the head of EPA, in the US who became head of the non proliferation of 
bioweapons and then became head of the counter proliferation of bioweapons. And 
use it as a chance to question the change in regulation of Mosquitoes from CDC to 
EPA, the categoriation of GM mosquitoes as pesticides etc.  
  
 
23rd November 2023 
Draft Affidavit notes for Cases against Health Ministers/WHO delegates. 
my initial research into a case against the health minister, it will be something that all 
countries can adapt, if they look up their health minister's representation at the 
Geneva May 2022. It will be easy to show the head of state that their health minister 
did not inform them of the extent of the loss of their decsion-making or sovereignty 
and how much money health ministries themselves have been promised to 
implement the WHO Treaty and Amended IHR Regulations.  Best regards, Frances 
We are also working on a timeline today to put at the beginning of an affidavit. 
“Criminal charges against the so-called philanthropic implementers were filed on the 
8th November 2023, so this means that the health minister can be found to be 
implicated in that criminal investigation OR civil charges OR other criminal charges. 
Ideas outlined below.

Comparative overview of rules on criminal ministerial responsibility 
Procedural rules for making government ministers criminally responsible 
 
In an extension of the police charges filed against WMP and Save the Children 
Fund, we bring the charge of Criminal responsibility against the Minister for Health 
on the following accounts: 
Gene Drive: 
The complexity and potential impact, decision making will involve multiple national 
authorities. 
Following existing and legal frameworks. 
Bill Gates Gene drives: The human being 
It is patent for the exclusive rights to computerize the human body which will 
eradicate the human species and replace with digital capacity and altered DNA. 
WHO Gene drive: 
Covid mRNA injections. 
Health Strategy: 
Mass implementation carrying Graphene which has altered people’s blood in many 
ways. Now oval cells, clotted cells, radical reduction in red blood. (example of how a 
gene drive can pass through a population intentionally presenting differently in each 
person) 
Definition of a Gene Drive 
The altering of an organism to over ride the natural laws of inheritance so that every 
offspring receives the new genetic sequence used to eradicate or replace a species, 
possible to achieve by the WHO by declaring a pandemic and injecting all 
generations possible in smaller organisms as reproductive cycles are much quicker. 
The WHOS own stand on Gene Drives is that they should be implemented one step 
at a time, e.g islands rather than continents to manage the risk of spread. The Global 
stand on Gene Drives is that there should be a moratorium on even their research. 
All the dangers of Gene editing are present in Gene Drives including unpredictability, 
inaccuracy and possible spread in the Environment and other species. The 
difference with a Gene Drive is that it will definitely persist in nature permanently 
altering the Gene Pool even if it disrupts function that we rely on including pollination, 
Photo synthesis, and irreversible degradation of human health. Using the example of 
Wolbachia bacteria, which reproduces very fast and is a symbiotic micro organism 
which means that it can transfer horizontally into soil and water and needs a host, 
adapts to the parasites in birds, fish and humans. The recent technology funded and 
conducted by the WMP has been made into a Gene Drive delivering Wolbachia 
infection to everyone of its offspring which makes it a gene drive in practice, but this 
has been denied by the WMP scientists and publicity materials. 
 
 The WHO one of the funders, in keeping with their protocol have chosen several 
islands for this experimental health strategy including Bali, Kalimantan and the 3 
other islands. All countries who have tried to develop regulation have concluded that 

it is a technology that is not ready for open air release and should only be conducted 
in high bio security laboratories. The main funders for Gene Drive research are the 
military ref. Jim Thomas ETC group and like the WHO Gene Drives are promoted for 
and researched on grounds of Health, Climate Action, Conservation, Agriculture, 
Food Security, while at the same time presenting the greatest hazard to Bio Diversity 
and Bio Security. This WHO principle is mirrored in every product and is contrary to 
expert advice, concerns and independent research.  
The weak science and false promotion has been lobbied to governments in the same 
way as the WMP and Save the Children fund has publicized the mass release of a 
harmless natural mosquito by a government program using Indonesian research, 
when in fact it’s the mass release of a Wolbachia IP Technology Gene Drive without 
one empirical risk assessment for mosquito strategies in Indonesia  (ref. Professor 
Michael Northcott confirmed one risk analysis using Bill Gates‘ Microsoft AI 
modelling)  the impact of Gene Drives and Genetic engineering are generally agreed 
to be immeasurable, but the Microsoft modelling and the independent arm of the 
WHO both concluded that of the 50 bio hazards that they identified were all of 
negligible risk. The Chairman of Save the Children Fund Weided….. Bill Gates, The 
Health for Minister, Scott O’Neill is the founder of the WMP and owner of the 
Wolbachia IP technology patent which claims exclusive rights to all digital 
equipment. The IP Technology couples with CNN AI Technology belonging to 
Microsoft. None of these people are doctors or scientists and should not be allowed 
to be responsible for our health decisions without government oversight. They have 
abused the power and positions given to them. Their influence including misuse of 
public funds, receiving bribes, advancing profit agendas using not-for-profit facades. 
This goes against international law about the proliferation and deployment of 
Hazardous bio agents and perjury. It should alert Departments of Defense that there 
is already a new law, called Counter Proliferation of Bioweapons, to justify the 
biosafety risks of mosquito factories, and pharmaceutical laboratories. This highlights 
the problem of bioweapons as both an offensive and defensive weapon artillery. 
 
Financial Due Diligence needs to be done on the WHO funders and Organization; 
businessmen, people in public office, and ‘acting’ government officials including 
acting Governor, acting Deputy Mayor, Acting Chairman of Save The Children Fund. 
The Bali Mosquito Program precedent is shown by 1) The ‘acting’ Governor wrote a 
notice, endorsed by the President, immediately following criminal charges being filed 
at the Bali Polda. The notice highlighted the concerns of absent safety assessment 
for ecology and human health, no socialization to the people, the project not being 
funded or managed by Indonesia and significant opposition to the release. These 
can be related to points of law in the Constitution that will all be ignored if the 
Pandemic Treaty comes into affect. It was not made public even after the 
postponement. Over-ruling the official Instruction by the acting Governor, the 
Minister for Health and earlier governor claimed Bali’s Approval and a central 
government OUM, had already been delivered. This is against democratic decision-
making as per the Constitution.  
 
In addition, the 2017 Legislation requires that any high impact government projects 
must be discussed by all the Ministers in the Co-ordination committee and informed 
consensus reached. The WHO/UN incoming laws will over ride all Indonesian 
legislation and Constitution. The ‘acting’ Mayor has been allowed to publish and 
circulate further promotional material from the Minister for Health and WPM, 

following the postponement, in contradiction to the Governor’s statement. The news 
articles, intended to reach the people, including those in Bali recruited by WMP to 
incubate the eggs have still not been told of the risks identified with the risks. The 
petition for due diligence has received over 55,000 signatures and the Bali police, 
Intelligence, Police Health Officer all unequivocally understood that the charges filed 
identified the eggs, laboratories and factories as carrying foreign bio-agents that 
would need to be confiscated and destroyed. It was understood as a matter for 
national security.  
 
It is endangering life to withhold a National Security concern from the Ministry of 
Defense. It is unconstitutional to not inform the public and then deny the People’s 
Assembly or Village Heads or Priests or any affected party direct answers to 
questions of efficacy and safety. 
 
The ‘acting’ Chairman of Save The Children, the Implementer of the Bali Program 
also used ignorance as defence when asked a basic scientific question and yet 
being referred to as liable. 
 
No experts in Bali leading the program. 
  
The WHO must be accused of this over-riding of due process, planning process 100 
times over - proof the pandemic 
The precedence for Bill Gates is his being sued for monopolising the market.  Anti-
competition lawsuit by the USA in 2003. Exactly the same as Microsoft now - 
because his technology was used in mapping, safety testing, surveillance technology 
and smart city internet of things processing of data collected. Behind the WHO, is 
this Microsoft technological control and sickness.  
Precedence in UK recently when he was refused to allow the purchase of the big 
gaming company. 
 
 
Constitution says central government can't impose on the provinces.

CHAPTER I 
FORM AND SOVEREIGNTY 
Article 1 
(1) The State of Indonesia is a Unitary State in the form of a Republic. 
(2) Sovereignty shall be vested in the hands of the people and be executed 
according to the Constitution.***) 
(3) The State of Indonesia is a state based on law. ***) 
 
Indonesia must hold the government health minister legally responsible regulated by 
Indonesia's constitutional system. Ministerial criminal responsibility can be governed 
by ordinary criminal procedure, the ordinary public prosecutor to initiate cases and 
ordinary criminal courts to judge them, according to ordinary rules of criminal 
procedure.  

 
The government or high court should authorize the continued investigation and 
stopping his active powers as health minister, since charges were filed, as it is 
compulsory for serious offences. 
 
Ministers may, otherwise be held criminally responsible under procedures that are 
different from ordinary criminal procedure both with regard to the initiation of cases, 
the investigation, the composition of the court and other procedural rules. These are 
usually referred to as “impeachment” proceedings, and the courts sometimes as 
“courts of impeachment”. 
 
 
Special (more political) impeachment proceedings for government ministers, it is 
usually the rule that these only apply to offences committed in their capacity as 
ministers - This is the distinction between actes détachables (unconnected with the 
exercise of ministerial functions) and actes rattachables (criminal acts conducted in a 
public capacity). The last category would include for example illegally giving or 
withholding permissions, taking bribes, corruption in general, and offences related to 
failure to disclose political contributions, the diversion of public funds to private 
purposes, but also include harm, theft and violence directed at political opponents. 
 
Special rules on impeachment proceedings need to cover all aspects, from the first 
inquiries and investigations,  
the decision to initiate proceedings,  
the rules on prosecution,  
the composition of the court,  
the rules on the procedure itself,  
including the procedural rights of the defendants. 
In countries with special impeachment procedures it is often for investigations with 
government oversight, scrutiny, special commissions of inquiry  
other procedures.authorise the continuation of the procedure after accusation, which 
is compulsory for the most serious offences - when the penalty is at least three 
years), 
the competence to make the decision is given to a parliamentary committee 
CHAPTER II 
THE PEOPLE’S CONSULTATIVE ASSEMBLY (MAJELIS PERMUSYAWARATAN 
RAKYAT) 
Article 2 
(1) The People’s Consultative Assembly consists of members of the People’s 
Representative Council (Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat) and members of the Regional 
Representative Council (Dewan Perwakilan Daerah) elected through general 
elections and to be further regulated by laws.**** 
The WHO May 27th 2022 contravene the Constitution of The People's Consultative 
Assemble as "The People’s Consultative Assembly shall convene at least once in 
every five years in the capital of the state." The two WHO amendments were that the 
18 months withdrawal period should be shortened from 18months to 10 months and 
the implementation period should be shortened from 2yrs to 1yr! Our constitutional 
processes happen every 5 years. 
 
Treason. 

Should have never committed an act of treason violation of law in the form of treason 
against the state, corruption, bribery, other felonies, or disgraceful acts acts; and/or 
the petition that the minister no longer meets the qualification as  
A charge of treason or of any offence against the security of the state brought 
against ministers needs the initiative of one quarter of the members of the 
corordination Dept and military and the approval of the majority thereof.  
The constitutional court can also be invited to give a binding opinion.  
 
The following notes are about how criminal ministerial responsibility is handled in 
Europe. 
The President of a Republic has the right to bring him to court to, for his 
representation in Geneva. 
There are special rules on the competent jurisdiction to adjudicate cases of criminal 
ministerial responsibility. The two main categories are: 
1. Countries with special courts of impeachment for government ministers; 
2. Countries in which cases of criminal ministerial responsibility are brought directly 
before 
a superior (ordinary) court. 
 
cases of criminal liability for ministers are referred to the Court of Justice of the 
Republic, which consists of fifteen members: twelve Members of Parliament, elected 
in equal number from among their ranks by the National Assembly and the Senate, 
and three judges of the Cour de cassation, 
five most senior judges of the Supreme Court and six representatives appointed by 
Parliament rights of representation, prohibition against self-incrimination, 
rules on evidence, presumption of innocence etc. It appears that in principle they 
usually apply, at least as a starting point, but that one may find a number of 
modifications and derogations in practice. The principle of two instances often does 
not apply to ministerial impeachment proceedings, where a one-instance procedure 
typically appears to be preferred due to the composition or the high level of the court. 
 
bribery, corruption, or more general prohibitions against “misuse of powers”, “abuse 
of office”, “maladministration” and the like. 
But breaches of the criminal code may also appear in the exercise of public office, if 
for example the minister is caught stealing or embezzling public funds. 
corruption. Another important example is the category of provisions that prohibit 
official “misuse of powers” or “abuse of office” 
 
The main activities of the ECPRD involve dealing with requests from one parliament 
to others in the network for information which is used to compare the legislative 
activities and parliamentary practice across different countries and in different 
institutions. Apr 20, 2018 
 
Malfeasance and nonfeasance against a person’s interest; malfeasance and 
nonfeasance by restriction of certain rights; malfeasance and nonfeasance against 
public interests., misconduct in public office is a common law offence committed by a 
public officer acting as such who wilfully neglects to perform his/her duty and/or 
wilfully misconducts him/herself to such a degree as to amount to an abuse of the 
public’s trust in the office holder”

My bio,  thanks to Margaret,  for several articles, interviews and TV appearances: 
“Frances worked with the Institute for Responsible Technology in 2021, on drafting 
and sharing legislative reports, on the challenges of regulating Gene Edited Micro-
organisms. Her research included the biosafety and health challenges of Gain of 
Function, Gene Drives, Biological Weapons, Green Technologies, Carbon Capture 
and Storage, gene edited Ingredients in food and Agriculture, GE Mosquitoes, GM 
Trees. The risks of even one modified microorganism persisting in Nature and 
inadvertently editing the fungal, bacterial and viral microbiomes on which life depend 
were found to be very high. The main challenge to regulation was Intellectual 
Property privacy, to protect military and trade value, while making public or 
independent risk assessment impossible. Governments had been lobbied, by the 
Pharmaceutical and Biotech Industry to grant exemptions from risk assessing 
genetically engineered organisms as invasive species. Environmental protection 
agencies were told to use old chemical contamination protocols instead, which do 
not take into account the spread of living organisms. Infant genetic engineering 
technologies, including CRISPR and micro-injection were promoted as natural and 
non-GMO.”

importance of establishing credibility: 
“Richard Claproth  received a PhD in Earth Science from the University of 
Wollongong, Australia . He also completed a Post-graduate Fellowship at the John

26th November - Update on bad news and good news in regard to the release and 
criminal charges: 
 
The police got our telephone numbers off us on some pretext, which allowed them to 
investigate and trace our work but did not do anything about investigating the 
foreign-funded and therefore illegal mass mosquito release. 
 
The scientists at any of the meetings did not attempt to answer the due diligence 
questions about the comparison between the trials and the Bali release.  
They have all received them though. Their only answer was their results were a 
‘promising’ success and that our concerns were invalid by rejecting our claim that 
gene editing is in fact Genetic Modification and Wolbachia IP Technology is in fact a 
monitoring system that they did not disclose.  

 
The majority of the questions do not depend on proving they are GMO or not. No 
one has been able to answer any of the 86 questions, all equally critical to any safety 
analysis of such a release. 
 
Richard met with WMP scientists and shared information in videos about 11 
additional diseases injected into eggs and the routine spike in the Encephalitis-
carrying Culex species, after releases of Wolbachia-Infected Aedes Aegypyti. And 
how authorities had tried to mandate a vaccine then for children for Japanese 
Encephalitis. That was after a release of 40,000. Bali had two cities faced with 200 
million breeding mosquitoes each. 
We saw the parallel for all disease spreading by the WHO, followed by vaccine 
mandating that will happen if the WHO come into world power. 
 
Then postponement was confirmed but no confiscation of the eggs, despite all 
departments being informed that it was likely they would release the eggs anyway, or 
move them or sell them if they were not seized for our own analysis.  
 
Unclosed releases are indeed what seems to have happened and it was confirmed 
that our Intelligence minister and Culture minister facilitated the import of this highly-
invasive species, despite strict rules on any other small import of non-native plant 
seeds, even. 
 
The Spiritual sanction for our work and case 
Bali Solidarity raised money to buy supplies for 40 families and Margaret brought 
them and us to Basaki Temple. It raised great hope when the Mangkus unanimously 
supported us and sent a formal letter to WMP and the government saying no to the 
mosquitoes or GMOs of any sort on Bali, saying that it was the ‘Island of the Gods, 
not the island where they could play God”. Furthermore the Mangkus received a 
message from the gods during our visit, that our intention to protect Bali and 
Indonesia was specifically blessed and would be successful. The three Gods of 
these temples, Bhrahma of Creation, Vishnu Sustenance and Shiva Transformation, 
destruction and rebirth let it be know that, as long as we apologized for allowing 
these instruments of destruction in to destroy Nature and as long as we acted in time 
to protect Nature from the upcoming disrespectful rule of the World Health 
Organization, it was promised that we would be successful, safe and all previous 
damage to our bodies and environment would be transmuted and returned to their 
structural integrity - which is why I made the Appeal to the Swiss Federal Supreme 
Court to decide that all territories and jurisdictions should be returned to their organic 
status and the administrative, economic and military bodies be dismantled and their 
assets seized for compensation (Appeal Filed by hand on 10th April 2024). 
 
26th November 2023 
Draft Letter to Indonesia’s President asking him to Reject the International Health 
Regulation Amendments, as Head of State 
Urgent 
President Joko Widodo, 
ADDRESS 
 
Dear President Widodo, 

We call upon you, as Head of State, to exercise your authority under Article 61 of the 
International Health Regulations (IHR) to send an official notice to REJECT THE 
AMENDMENTS that significantly shorten the time period the Indonesian government 
will have, to reject the next batch of amendments, and the next, into the future. They 
were adopted at the 75th World Health Assembly on May 27, 2022, which was 18 
months ago. The International Health Regulations gave countries 18 months to reject 
the Amendments, so now you have less than two weeks, until 1st December 2023, 
to take immediate action - we have attached a template to help carry out this crucial 
decision as eleven other countries have recently done. 
Were you aware that last May, the Health Minister went to the Geneva World Health 
Assembly and recommended adopting these Health Regulation Amendments as a 
business strategy? 
(https://www.un.org/en/about-us/member-states/indonesia). Did the Health Minister 
have approval from you? Have the many changes to the International Health 
Regulations and WHO Agreement been passed by the Coordination Department, as 
these will drastically limit other departments and decision-making after the 
December1st 2023? 
You have recent experience of this, as the Ministry of Health approved the World 
Mosquito Program as a health strategy, without informing the Coordination 
Department (breach of 2017 legislation) or the country, which has created an uproar 
and a split. If you do not reject these amendments in time, then there will be no 
opportunity to do due diligence on the efficacy, safety, national security or financial 
vested interests, of any future health strategies implemented by the foreign, 
unelected body, the WHO. Indonesia’s own governance will lose all choice as 
everything that the Health Minister has agreed with the World Health Organization 
and United Nations will become legally binding. 
The Police Special Intelligence committed to destroying the mosquito eggs, when 
charges were filed that they contained surveillance-technology. Wolbachia IP 
Technology coupled with Microsoft CNN AI was mentioned in the Ministry of Health’s 
Scale Up report, but the mosquitoes had been falsely publicized as completely 
‘natural’. We are in danger of blindly walking into a massive proliferation, deployment 
and threat of biotechnology. 
You have the authority, as Head of State, to make this decision, simply by sending a 
formal notice to the Director General of the WHO and the President of the United 
Nations, as did Belarus, Bolivia, Cuba, North Korea, Eritrea, Iran, Nicaragua, Russia, 
Syria, Venezuela and Zimbabwe recently, having realized the ramifications. Although 
Indonesia was one of the first countries to sign up, you as President have the power 
to stop it. There are questions that can be answered afterwards about the legitimacy 
and legality of the International Health Regulations themselves. 
We implore you to take the action that is needed right now and please take another 
bold step to protect Indonesian people, environment, economy and sovereignty. 
Respectfully,  
 
BEFORE the deadline of December 1, 2023.

Wolbachia-Infected Mosquitoes and Military Involvement (1): 
Urgent: WHO's Protracted Crisis Website 
I discovered a WHO/Armed Forces website repeatedly noting Save The Children 
Fund as coordinators involved in policing protracted crises. 
Sent to our lawyer to prove militarization and weaponisation of Health: 
“I was looking for offices of the navy army and airforce as their power will be 
superseded too. And that's when I found a WHO Indonesian Armed Forces website, 
with many unpopulated pages but 5 or 6 went to Save The Children Fund - who we 
filed police charges against in Bali. 
https://extranet.who.int/emt/principle-options/organization-complies-
principle?page=26 
 
It connected Slovakia, Japan, and by today more pages seem to have been 
populated. with other countries. 
 
Richard did a preliminary analysis which I also attach explaining how the website 
seems to be the infrastructure for WHO to implement protracted crises and 
emergency measures. Where each page claimed that the principle has been agreed 
with a lesser official, some of whom Richard knew... Today, I didn't see so many 
emails and names of these lesser officials, who claim they have the authority to 
make this agreement ,but at the top of each page it now says instead the 
organization name and then 'complies with this principle' 
 
Then Richard found this article showing an OUM (official undertaking memorandum? 
) Then he found the agreement between the defence and health ministers and WHO 

director general. https://www.who.int/indonesia/news/detail/15-11-2022-the-republic-
of-indonesia-and-who-agree-to-strengthen-health-emergency-operational-readiness-
and-emergency-medical-teams-in-countries#:~:text=Bali 
Then I found a question mark over the legitimacy of the Defence minister 
https://thediplomat.com/2021/06/assessing-prabowo-subiantos-defense-diplomacy/ 
Can lawyers assess whether this is proof that the WHO do intend to decide 
protracted crises and emergency health measures and decisions never return to the 
individual countries because it is such a good market. Can they assess standing of 
their health ministers and defence ministers? Can anybody get this concern out? 
 
"The vaccination turned out to be the greatest blessing for the money and world's 
elites, for the pharmaceutical industry and politics. They could pursue their own 
interests, under the common slogan "Everything for public health", "everything for 
the well-being of the general public". To achieve this goal, they created the WHO. 
This non-democratically elected people, basically a private association that is in the 
process of gaining power over the healthcare system in the 190 Member States"

I put this quote to connect to the mosquitoes which are another market boom that is 
for 'public health' by not for profits'  
 
Thank you for asking for my bioweapons reports. I attach my Bioweapons weapons 
presentation for when I was speaker at the first Gladiator Bangsa webinar and my

 WHO treaty draft. sustainability = sustaining WHO funding for pandemic 
preparedness which = the blatant proliferation of gene-edited bio agents either 
released into the environment or directly injected into us, all approved by the WHO, 
with no scientific study allowed as gene sequences will not be allowed in the public 
domain, and WHO 'recommendations' will soon be 'law'. 
I think this WCH article is the best summation of the project so far although I think 
there's a longer one that includes Professor Michael's symposium presentation.

Wolbachia-Infected Mosquitoes and Military Involvement (2): 
Analysis of WHO and TNI Relations 
By: Richard Claproth 
 
The World Health Organization (WHO) has released intriguing information on its 
website regarding the involvement of the Indonesian National Armed Forces (TNI). 
The  link to TNI information on the WHO site raises questions about the relationship 
between this global health organization and the Indonesian military. 
 
Information on the WHO Site: On April 7, 2019, the WHO site listed Indonesian 
military contacts, notably Colonel Tjahja Nurrobi, who served as the Chief of 
Cooperation and Medical Civic Mission Unit. This raises the question: why appoint 
military contacts to represent WHO, especially when they are not the primary 
decision-makers? Dr. RM Tjahja Nurrobi, leads the Integrated Health Services 
Division at the TNI Health Center with the rank of Navy Colonel and is also a 
permanent lecturer at the Indonesian Defense University (UNHAN). 
 
Another operational contact, Captain Soni Lasmana, from the Navy of the 
Indonesian Armed Forces Headquarters, serves as the Staff of the Surgeon General 
of the Indonesian Armed Forces. The WHO site also provides information on 
"protracted crises," highlighting incidents that are chemical, biological, radiological, 
or nuclear (CBRN) in nature. "Protracted crises" refer to difficult situations that 
persist or last for an extended period. In the WHO context, Captain Soni Lasmana is 
involved in protracted crises, including CBRN events, indicating a focus on incidents 
that may last a long time. 
 
This information may be related to international cooperation or sharing information 
related to medical and health activities. However, considering the cunning modus 
operandi of the World Mosquito Program (WMP), such as the operation in Bali to 
release 200 million mosquitoes, it needs to be monitored by the Indonesian 
Intelligence Agency (BAIS) and the National Intelligence Agency (BIN). The following 
is a thought simulation of a fasting scientist critically thinking about WHO information 
and its relationship with national intelligence agencies, and this information is of a 
simulated nature. 
 
In the context of a national security simulation related to biological threats, several 
possibilities can be considered: 
 
• 
Military Involvement in Health Emergencies: 
 
• 
Military contacts, such as Colonel Tjahja Nurrobi and Captain Soni 
Lasmana, in medical missions and civil citizenship contexts indicate the possibility of 
collaboration between the military and the health sector. This may aim to respond to 
health emergencies, including biological threats. 
 
• 
The question is, what is the TNI's stance on Wolbachia-infected 
mosquitoes? 
 
 
• 
Coordination of Preparedness and Response: 

 
• 
Military forces are often involved in national preparedness and 
response efforts, including those related to biosecurity. Their involvement may focus 
on coordinating medical missions, deploying personnel, and managing logistics in 
the face of biosecurity threats. 
 
• 
The question is, why is the TNI silent? 
 
 
• 
Interagency Collaboration: 
 
• 
Collaboration between the military and health organizations, as 
indicated by contacts on the WHO site, may reflect efforts to enhance interagency 
collaboration. This is crucial to responding to biosecurity threats by leveraging the 
strengths and resources of different sectors. 
 
• 
The question is, why was this information not anticipated, especially 
when BAIS and BIN were informed beforehand and remained silent? 
 
 
• 
Sharing Information for Global Health Security: 
 
• 
The presence of this information on the WHO site may indicate a 
commitment to transparency and international cooperation in the realm of global 
health security. Sharing details about key contacts and coordination points can 
facilitate a rapid and coordinated response to emerging health threats. 
 
• 
The question is, has the TNI examined genetically modified mosquitoes 
from the perspective of national defense and security? Why did the TNI not question 
BIN, which allowed the import of mosquito eggs from Australia? 
 
 
• 
Dual-Use Capability: 
 
• 
Military organizations often have dual-use capabilities, meaning they 
can contribute to both defense and civilian purposes. In the context of biosecurity, 
this may involve utilizing military infrastructure and expertise for public health 
purposes. 
 
• 
The question is, regarding Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes, why hasn't 
the TNI taken a stance? 
 
 
• 
Enhanced Monitoring and Supervision: 
 
• 
Military involvement in biosecurity includes enhanced monitoring and 
supervision capabilities. The military can play a role in monitoring and securing 
borders to prevent the spread of biological threats. 
 
• 
Given the dissemination of information about the release of Wolbachia 
mosquitoes without involving the TNI, what is the TNI's stance? 
 
Overall, the presence of military contacts in the biosecurity context can indicate a 
comprehensive and collaborative approach to addressing potential threats. This 
emphasizes the importance of coordinated efforts across various sectors to protect 
national security from biosecurity challenges. 
 
Additional questions arise: Why does the military remain silent in the release of 
Wolbachia mosquitoes? Is it because there is an order from the WHO to remain 
silent? These questions involve policy aspects and may be related to specific 
contexts. However, in many cases, government decisions or health institutions' 
decisions to involve or not involve the military in health initiatives, such as the 
release of Wolbachia mosquitoes, may be influenced by specific considerations. 
Some factors that can influence these decisions include: 

 
• 
Public Health Expertise and Involvement: 
 
• 
Health initiatives are often managed by departments or public health 
institutions with specialized expertise in the field. The military may not always be the 
most suitable body to handle specific health issues. If yes, how prepared is the TNI 
to face bioweapon threats? 
 
 
• 
Utilization of Military Resources: 
 
• 
Careful consideration of military resource utilization. In the context of 
releasing Wolbachia mosquitoes, if the military has the capability or resources that 
can help, they may be involved. However, this decision will depend on national 
strategy and health policies. The situation is urgent because mosquitoes have 
already been released. Why hasn't the TNI taken a stance? 
 
 
• 
Coordination between the Health Sector and Military: 
 
• 
Coordination between the health sector and the military can be a 
crucial factor. In some cases, health initiatives may involve cooperation and 
coordination between different institutions. Has this coordination been done with the 
Minister of Health, Minister of Manpower, Minister of Tourism, Minister of 
Environment, Minister of National Development Planning (Bappenas), Minister of 
Defense, BAIS, and BIN? The leadership of the new TNI leaders is being tested 
here. 
 
 
• 
Approval and Legal Regulations: 
 
• 
Approval and legal regulations may govern the military's role in public 
health activities. The decision to involve or not involve the military may be influenced 
by the applicable legal framework. Why hasn't the TNI used this right? 
 
 
• 
Consultation with International Organizations: 
 
• 
In some cases, governments may consult with international 
organizations such as the WHO to seek guidance or approval before involving the 
military in public health activities. If this is done, our country's sovereignty has 
already been taken over by the WHO. Did the TNI let that happen? 
 
 
• 
Public Perception: 
 
• 
Public perception of the military's role in health initiatives can also play 
a role. The government may consider public response to the military's presence in 
the health context. However, the people are eagerly awaiting a firm stance from the 
TNI. When will that firmness be announced to the public? 
 
Although orders or guidance from the WHO may be a crucial factor in decision-
making, this is not a reason for the TNI Commander to remain silent. Why? 
 
The country is in a critical situation! 
 
1st December 2023 
 
Original plan to Ireland’s Finance Minister to establish public banks. Now it has been 
put to the Federal Supreme Court to expel the WEF and other defendants from 
Switzerland and pay the Compensation directly to the people through public banks. 
The ministers, Paschal Donohoe and Leo Varadka treasonously sold Ireland’s water 

resource to the central bank for a poultry 8 billion instead. Within 2 weeks of my 
proposal to make Ireland’s plentiful water the golden peg and standard for public 
banks.  
 
This proposal was written in consultation with monetary reform expert and retired US 
Treasury Analyst, Richard C. Cook. (Author of a six part series: “Credit As A Public 
Utility” and the book: We Hold These Truths, The Hope of Monetary Reform). He 
wrote a UBI implementation policy for America’s Green Party 10 years ago, called 
The Cook Plan.  
  
Mr. Cook has developed the following plan adapted to Ireland, on request from 
Frances Micklem at Harmony Hall Think Tank, with whom he has been able to 
explore all the existing economic, agricultural, social and pandemic-related 
challenges here in Ireland and assess the risks and benefits of using existing 
infrastructure, benefits system and banking institutions.  
  
He found that theUBI must be implemented through a new Public Bank, and we have 
outlined how that bank can be capitalized, immediately and going forwards, to 
restore local economies, rather than increasing the national debt.  
  
Capitalizing The Bank, building trust in green economics and illustrating the benefits 
to all of green policies. 
  
We propose three initial ways to capitalize the public bank/community bank or what 
we have called the Sustainability Bank. The first two sources are front-running Green 
Party proposals already. In addition to capitalization, initial administrative costs 
would be met from the state budget. 
  
1) The Carbon Tax 
 Firstly, the ring-fenced carbon tax. The benefit and necessity of a bank structure, to 
this proposal, is that a bank, by definition, can lend multiple times more money than 
it has in reserve.A reserve ratio of six to one to eight to one is recommended. If the 
carbon tax were put into the Sustainability Bank, it would effectively multiply the 
bank’s spending and lending power to the community. As its loans are repaid in full 
the actual reserves of the bank remain stable. 
  
By using a portion of the reserve for administrative costs, once the bank is 
established, interest-free loans could be offered to sustainable initiatives starting up 
again or new. This would include sustainable farming serving local markets. In 
Germany, for example, the commercial banks have only 12% of the market. Here in 
Ireland, 99% of mortgages and 95% of small business loans are with our five 
commercial banks. An estimated 40% of the cost of European goods is to pay 
interest to banks and other parts of the global financial system. Implementation of a 
public Sustainability Bank would cut out the expenses of bank interest for small 
farms/growers/services and local market economies. Building local communities 
would reduce destructive emissions from transporting, while also building food 
security and monitoring bigger polluters. Customers of this bank would have this 
monitoring and responsibility function, as they would all have invested in the 
Sustainability Charter and would be keen to expose industry emissions non-
compliance. 

  
Government must detail further toxic and wasteful activities to which the carbon tax 
will soon apply. For example, use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, manufacture 
and sale of products containing microplastics, excessive use or contamination of 
fresh water and automation in large food plants – I refer to Pasta Concepts that I 
know of but it is commonplace – that produce over a tonne of pasta every lunch time 
that is wasted as they leave the machines running but all take a lunch break 
simultaneously. Also limitation of run-off from intensive farms, if accounted for, would 
encourage a reduction in herd numbers and exploitation.  
  
In addition to taxation, there must be a clear ban on the import of products by 
supermarkets, which have been produced using substances banned here in Ireland 
or our farmers will continue not to stand a chance of selling their harvested crops.  
  
Re. the Carbon Dividend Policy: Meat exporters should not have their carbon tax 
rebated as soon as they have a customer receipt outside the state (The Carbon 
Dividend Policy currently suggests this in a foot note on the first page.), as it is 
promoting export which the party is trying to stop. Only individuals should be 
considered for concessions and rebates, not businesses. Businesses and 
corporations will pass on their extra carbon costs to the consumer anyway. If the tax 
works and emissions are reduced, the bank structure will ensure that the public 
Sustainability Bank is still making money, through its other functions and because 
dividends aren’t reduced as less carbon tax becomes payable. 
  
2) Welfare and Covid-19 Emergency Payments 
The second way of capitalizing the public Sustainability Bank is by the welfare and 
emergency payments. To shift them into a UBI payment, they should be paid, from 
the start, to recipients throughthe public bank. This would ensure another large 
investment; several hundred thousand passing through the new bank each week. All 
payments should stand at €350 a week across the board. This guarantees a 
massively positive association in people’s minds that the Green Party’s UBI and 
carbon tax plan succeeded in substantially raising their benefits and quality of life.  
  
The UBI can then actually be described and seen asthe dividend that government 
has talked of that every citizen will receive. Not a little bit here and there, but the 
Green Party will have facilitated a reliable unconditional basic income, considerably 
greater than current Job Seekers allowance and valuing all citizens equally, while 
giving them the chance to build self-sufficiency, subsistence and community-living, 
care and service into their post-Covid working lives. 
  
So first, we must get legislation in place for the public Sustainability Bank. There is 
no time to waste, as many experts believe the economic recession resulting from the 
pandemic will have severe and long-lasting effects on all nations, including the EU 
and US. To meet an uncertain future without plunging into massive debt and 
mortgaging its future for decades, Ireland needs the public Sustainability Bank, the 
UBI, and food and water security to be in place immediately.  
  
Nor will the Irish taxpayer have to bail out the five “pillar banks” again, from whom we 
will otherwise have had to borrow 3 billion at high interest rates, as has been 
proposed as a recovery plan. We also explain how quantitative easing is still a 

version of commercial banking (as is the State-owned Corporate Strategic Bank 
started in 2015) and how massive borrowing in the global commercial marketplace 
will devastate Ireland’s future. In fact, Ireland is facing national bankruptcy if we must 
mortgage our future to the global financial system just to get over the pandemic.  
  
Additionally, the public Sustainability Bank will quickly have the ability to aid 
sustainable projects to recover and finance new enterprises for people, unable to 
return to the workforce, with a basic income. This will also allow Ireland to move 
toward food self-sufficiency, with a target of 75%. 
  
A public Sustainability Bank doesn’t depend on pure credit, lending and interest but 
is rooted in Ireland’s real resources of land and water. The bank charter would 
include how loan decisions should be based on preservation, food security, 
sustainable production facilities, services and skills. Therefore it will support 
productivity and/or reduction in harmful activities/materials.  
  
3) Water, land and skilled labour as reserve basis for the Sustainability Bank. 
A crucial proposition we have made is to include water as a reserve basis for the 
Sustainability Bank. It plays across the broad macro economics of food supply, 
within which access to clean sustainable water supply is recognized as a crucial 
resource dependence. In leveraging this theme to the maximum, we have started to 
articulate how a public Sustainability Bank would leverage water as a collateral / 
asset base in the proposal, for coastal, rural and city dwellers.  
  
Thus there will be less and less need for people or the government to borrow from 
commercial banks and increase our debt, thereby risking Ireland’s future for 
generations to come.   
  
Please do not hesitate to ask any questions or to arrange a meeting with Mr. Cook. 
He is willing to work with us every step of the way, in understanding all aspects of 
the plan and any concerns. He would help build an understanding of how it fits in to 
the current economic situation here in Ireland and how it can be implemented, 
without directly interfering with the work of the main banks and industries which can 
continue business as usual as best they can.  
  
This will be a bailout for the people and the system change we need, based on 
Ireland’s real resources. The Sustainability Bank and UBI also offer a commitment to 
helping the recovery from the pandemic, without pushing our financial and climate 
change difficulties down the road by increasing our national debt.  
  
1st December 2023  
First Notice served on Tedros Ghebreyesus, head of the WHO  
Forwarded to the lead lawyer who is holding the WHO to account in Switzerland and 
helping many others, with a consideration of the lawful jurisdiction held by men and 
women. 
 
Dear Philip,  
I am a friend of Peter Ganze and I thank you both for the formal letter you composed 
for Indonesia to alert Heads of State to their opportunity and need to reject the 
International Health Regulation Amendments. It was sent to over 1000 ministers.  

 
Yesterday, I also served notice on Tedros Ghebreyesus. I hope my scientific due 
diligence questions will be another strand to your legal case. It was sent to about 460 
officials and all the scientists at the WHO office in Geneva, who I looked up, as 
member states would expect to receive our answers from them. The head scientist is 
Sir Jeremy Farrah, Wellcome Trust who gave Oxitec Mosquitoes 6.8 million during 
the lockdown, 2021.  
 
The precedent I used was the criminal charges filed against the Mosquito Program 
and Save The Children Fund here in Bali, so I sent it to the local stake holders of that 
program too, as well as the Indonesia's National Defence, Health and Presidential 
ministry officials, plus all the Heads of State in other countries, to whom I had sent 
earlier recommendations to withdraw from the WHO. I also sent it to government 
ministers and MEPs, from all over the world, many from Ireland, where I lived in 
private in my off-grid, bioarchitecture, vegan organic-registered think tank and 
energy centre.  
 
I corrected my status to living woman in 2021, signing Harmony Hall off the national 
land registry and submitting my own Deeds of Allodial Rights to public record. I also 
signed off the voting register, in recognition that men and women stand above public 
servants in the Constitution. This means, as you will know, that it  wouldn't be right 
for me to attend court when this case is heard and decided. I will happily make a 
statement, especially if it is outlined what exactly would be most useful. Furthermore, 
Margaret Denmead and the Bali Solidarity group who researched and are fighting for 
justice against the Bali Mosquito release, wider threats of mass releases and the 
WHO,  are very keen to help you and the 12 MEPs in any way they can. It was this 
group that got your letter to a list of 1600 ministers and ambassadors to alert them of 
the IHR rejection deadline. 
 
I will cc this message to Professor Richard Claproth, richardclaproth@gmail.com, 
(whose background includes posts as Deputy Coordinating Minister for Economics, 
Finance and Industry, serving as Secretary to the Minister for State-Owned 
Enterprises and member of the State Defense Institute Economics Team) who, with 
Gladiator Bangsa, filed the criminal case with the police, in Bali. He is prepared and 
determined with the scientific, social, and political knowledge to give evidence and or 
bring a legal challenge ourselves.  
 
Centrally, i think we can prove that the WHO Treaty breaches the International 
Treaty on The Non Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction. Anthony Ruggerio, 
in  America was head of EPA, then head of Non-proliferation of Bioweapons and 
then head of the Counter Proliferation of Bioweapons, demonstrating how regulatory 
approvals and justifications have now come to allow massive research and factory 
facilities to house colonies of hundreds of millions of stabilized organisms, ready to 
deploy as eggs and drugs.  
 
It may be easier to argue that even biotechnology that is researched for the benefit 
of world health carries incalculable counter-indications with other technologies and 
our microbiome. This means that all the technologies in agriculture, food, 
conservation, climate action, pharmacueticals and communications have already 
triggered mass destruction in nature. The independent scientists, you might need, 

work with Jeffrey Smith, Institute For Responsible Technology, on their 25 year' 
GMO and Gene-editing protection campaign. The international expert on wifi and 
EMF technology's degradation on human health and the environment is Diarmaid 
Mulcahy diarmaid51@gmail.com (Whose background involves Government reform, 
international marine, agricultural organic inputs, water resources, further focus on 
refugee/humanitarian needs, environmental issues,  international development and 
social justice, main focus Africa and EU, Green Party Pollicy Council Chairman and 
MEP candidate against unregulated 5G).   
 
Wishing you the very best of luck,                                                        
 
3 Notices served on the WHO and WEF et al 
Notice 1) to Reject the Amendments and discard the Treaty, unless the following 
questions can be adequately answered: 
 
Appellant versus the defendants: In earlier instance: 
Notice 1) Conditional Acceptance served on the WHO, WEF and all Implementers: 
Due Diligence questions on the Scientific Foundation. 30th November 2023 
Notice 2) Cease and Desist Retaliation and other penalties deployed in response to 
our Achieving a Postponement of the mass release: 6th December 2023 
Notice 3) Personal liability and Intention to Prosecute 13th-22nd March 2024 
Notice to Reject the Amendments and discard the Treaty, unless the following 
questions can be adequately answered and specifically the question: 
Do the Pandemic Treaty’s Prevention, Preparedness and Response Principles of 
researching, producing and scaling up technologies contravene the International 
Treaty Prohibiting the Non-Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction. 
We write in honour as men and women of the WHO Member States to the man, 
Tedros Ghebreyesus, acting as Director General of the World Health Organization, 
the world authority on international health. We respectfully ask you to share the 
scientific foundation of the WHO Treaty and IHR Amendments. 
The format of these questions is to establish: 
The ways in which the Science behind the Pandemic Treaty, is the same as the 
science with which the World Health Organization carefully handled the Covid 19 
Pandemic. 
Furthermore, we request the most rigorous scientific papers that substantiate WHO’s 
safety and efficacy claims and approvals. We ask that they be issued to the 
individual men and women who will be responsible in governments mandating 
community uptake and medicine adherence, and those who work in health care, 
administering mandated pharmaceutical products, including vaccines? We also ask 
that this complete and exhaustive presentation be made to the NGO’s that are 
implementing WHO health strategies without any grasp of the risks and ramifications 
of proposed measures such as boosters, lockdowns, social distancing, masks, PCR 
testing, mass mosquito releases, aerosol and smart technologies, and artificial 
technology monitoring, modelling and mapping, and to which parties data will be 
available to? The NGO implementers are already providing a human shield for WHO 
delegate and WHO strategies. 
Is it only each country’s health minister who will be directly able to attend discussions 
or vote at the World Health Assembly? 
Is it through this one delegate that all public money and pandemic fund will be 
dedicated to supporting the implementation of the WHO Treaty, and possibly away 

from other beneficial infrastructure? 
Why have the military been enlisted to police ‘protracted crises’ and receive training 
in this? the corporate social responsibility of producers for the WHO’s supply chain, 
critical links to correction processes, like compensating countries when the WHO 
does harm and liability? First of all, are both pharmaceutical producers and the 
World Health Assembly fully indemnified if there is wide scale damage to the 
environment or loss of life? Will governments be able to use Pandemic Fund money 
to address damages? 
There are competent authorities in all member states who want to grasp the scientific 
detail of the WHO’s One Health security technologies and biotechnologies and their 
interaction. We are becoming aware that this analysis of the interaction between 
several technologies is in fact impossible. We the people are concerned that many 
individual elements of technological innovation have already been produced and 
utilised in medical, food, agriculture, conservation, military and surveillance contexts, 
in good faith, but as dangerous interactions emerge, as with chemicals, the 
pandemic prevention, preparedness and response technologies may later be 
recognised as multiple elements of one weapon of mass destruction that has 
unintentionally been launched. 
All these technologies, including green technologies, are beyond human 
understanding, and therefore should be renamed red technologies, as warnings 
about unforeseeable counter-indications, as they start to affect our breathing, vision, 
heart and other functions. We humbly ask the WHO to comment on the body of 
knowledge that makes up these concerns linking GMOs to the degradation of health 
and harmony, and to commit to the cautionary principle in approving the introduction 
of more. 
You will understand, at once, that all responsible governments will need to justify 
WHO emergency measures, including losses of freedom to make a living, travel, or 
look after their dependents and justify the over-ruling of rights to bodily integrity and 
existing health protections and medical models, with the WHO’s inclusion of 
biotechnology in mandated injections for Health Certification, or the mass release of 
mosquitoes. 
Unfortunately there has already been criminal charges brought against two charities, 
World Mosquito Program and Save The Children fund, the implementers of a WHO- 
approved deployment of Wolbachia Mosquito eggs in Bali. The investigation by 
Police, National Security and Immigration span misleading and false advertising, by 
the World Mosquito Program, as a government program using a natural mosquito, 
when it turned out to be 100% foreign-funded, with considerable payments paid to 
stake holders to allow the release. Furthermore it was admitted that the mosquitoes 
are gene-edited to include patented Wolbachia IP Technology which will pass to all 
future generations, which make their release a gene drive technology, an 
infringement of privacy, a bio attack to introduce undisclosed artificial intelligence 
capacity and a Gain of Function by the micro injection of a bacteria that the species 
released does not naturally carry. Finally, senior World Mosquito Program 
researchers admitted that following the release of Wolbachia Aedes Aegypti, there 
was a huge spike in another species Culex which transmitted up to 11 new viruses 
including Japanese Encephalitis, which children then contracted and an immediate 
vaccine of all children under 15 was proposed. The scientists knew this, but did not 
declare it, which is a cause for concern when risks of fatalities, associated with a 
health strategy are recorded but not declared.  
 

 Member states would be encouraged if they were able to read the WHO’s review of 
its advice to Member States. Finally to meet the scientists in both the constructing of 
the Pandemic Prevention, Preparedness, and response plan, and also the scientists, 
sociologists, bioethics experts who make up the Independent arm of the World 
Health Organization who will conduct future Risk Analyses on health strategies that 
are to be made law. Would they like to provide assurance that independent studies 
will be welcomed and open science practiced? 
“GMO Regulatory and Legislative Outlook REPORT" 
https://protectnaturenow.com/pdfviewer/legislative-report/ 
 Further questions 
A. Vaccination 
Do mRNA vaccines require gene editing? 
Does Gain of Function research require Gene Editing? 
Does the study of Potential Pandemic Pathogens require gene editing 
Are gene edited products regulated differently to genetically modified organism? 
Why? Is gene editing considered more safe, natural, precise or predictable? 
“Genetically Modified Microbes: Technological and Legislative Challenges and 
National Security Implications” https://protectnaturenow.com/pdfviewer/gmm-
executive-summary/ 
How does the WHO’s safety testing and approval rules of gene edited bacteria and 
other microbes, which can spread, differ from the testing of chemicals, which 
containment are possible? 
Please share the WHO’s policies on clinical trials using animals in vivisection, human 
trials ad open air trials of agricultural and climate action ‘green’ technologies? 
Does the WHO plan to implement more than one technology at the same time, for 
example Wi-Fi technology for biosecurity and a national vaccination program, as a 
pandemic preparedness or emergency measure? 
How have the WHO’s scientists tested the interactions between different 
technologies for counter-indications to human health? 
Has the definition of a vaccine been changed? 
Does it now include a gene therapy that generates an immune response? 
During the Covid 18 pandemic emergency response did the WHO record any risks 
associated with the vaccines’ interaction with the human body? 
Could these all be attributed to underlying issues? 
Were some previously healthy people affected in different ages groups? 
How did the WHO’s researchers decide when to recommend vaccination for different 
age groups? 
Have the WHO identified ways to reduce adverse events in future national and 
international vaccine roll outs? Please include the mitigation of risks. 
What is the process that national governments can enter into, to stop a national 
health measure being implemented, following an unexpected harmful consequence? 
 
 We didn’t have a chance to prevent the Covid 19 pandemic. What new strategies 
does the WHO Treaty propose in order to prevent a future pandemic? Please share 
the science these are based on? Will Potential pandemic pathogens be created in 
labs in order to look at diseases that could happen in nature? 
“Gain of Function Research And The Risk Of The Next Pandemic” 
https://protectnaturenow.com/pdfviewer/gain-of-function-research-executive- 
summary/ 
Will Potential pandemic pathogens be created in labs in order to look at diseases 

that could happen in nature? 
These are known as gain of function research, aren’t they? 
Does this means that scientists use gene editing to give an existing pathogen either 
higher transmissibility or make them more lethal? 
How does the WHO decide whether to make a disease more transmissible or more 
lethal or sometimes both? 
Please can you show the WHO’s criteria for which research to sponsor for pandemic 
preparedness? 
Is research assessed and proposed by the WHO or are research projects proposed 
by researchers? 
What is your biosafety standard for laboratories? 
Will the WHO continue to open fund research projects in universities? 
Whose idea were mass releases of mosquitoes? 
B. National Biosafety 
How do university laboratories contain gene-edited microbes and larger organisms? 
How will bio-containment/contamination/gene transfer/unexpected interactions in the 
microbiome a) human body b) environment be monitored by WHO Member States’ 
own laboratories? 
Monitored by health and environmental protection agencies? 
Will all gene sequences, active ingredients and technological mechanisms be in the 
public domain, to facilitate independent testing and scrutiny by national planning 
authorities and hospitals for follow up? 
How will this be affected by a) trade patents - for technologies released on 
experimental permits 
Or b) WHO-conducted military biosecurity - protecting information on bio agents that 
could unintentionally or intentionally become a weapon of mass destruction? 
“Bioweapons Draft Paper covering Treaties and Definitions” https:// 
healingbyfranc.blogspot.com/2023/11/weapons-of-mass-destruction-do-who.html 
Does the WHO consider all research facilities a risk of the intentional or unintentional 
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction? 
Is that why the WHO Treaty outlines that only products from the WHO’s own supply 
chain will be approved for certification for travel and inclusion in the digital 
passports? 
Which manufacturers have you chosen for inclusion in your logistics supply chain? 
How has the WHO evaluated the bigger pharmaceutical companies, with mixed 
violation track records against smaller research projects which do not use genetic 
engineering in the medical models they study? 
What percentage of research projects are funded to assess the safety and efficacy of 
WHO technologies to be implemented? Member states need to be aware of the risks 
being taken and know what negative impacts to monitor for and report on. 
 
 In the WHO’s review of the Covid 19 pandemic, what processes and tools are the 
WHO using to evaluate the choices, cost, safety efficacy, success, failings, adverse 
events and continued monitoring of short medium longterm effects and 
effectiveness? 
How many years will the effect of the vaccines and lockdowns be monitored for? 
Again, in the Bali investigation it was found that only a few people died of Dengue, a 
fraction of those who died by accident or died by suicide. How will the WHO address 
this tragic phenomenon? 
Were the many interactions between the human body and mRNA and other vaccines 

recorded? 
Will the WHO guarantee that the active ingredients of future vaccines and biotech 
products will be shared with municipal water management schemes so that they can 
use those parameters to test and filter for its appearance in the environment? “Green 
Technologies: Many Elements Interact As One Unintentional Weapon of Mass 
Destruction” 
https://healingbyfranc.blogspot.com/2023/11/one-big-weapon-of-mass- 
destruction.html 
The case of the World Mosquito Program contradicts the biotech industry’s premise 
that gene-edited organisms and microorganisms are precise, safe and predictable. 
Scientists could not directly answer whether the Wolbachia was passed through 
inherited gene transfer or describe how they mitigated risks of all the other 
pathogens present in mosquito eggs and larvae, at birth. “Mosquitoes From A 
Microbial Perspective” https://healingbyfranc.blogspot.com/2023/11/gmo-
mosquitoes-from-microbial.html What science underpins the WHO’s policy to treat 
whole countries that are not yet sick or asymptomatic? 
Can the WHO advisors show the critical papers that explain the term ‘asymptomatic? 
Please share the reasoning to trust PCR test results at various resolutions above the 
empirically experienced health of the population? 
How are potential pandemic pathogens stored? 
How are research facilities supposed to manage their waste and water, to prevent a 
release of initial research failures and stocks of stabilised enhanced pathogens? 
Does this help with preparing a vaccine to be ready to respond to an outbreak? 
Using the Wolbachia-mosquito research, the public were told it took thousands of 
attempts at microinjection of Wolbachia Bacteria before the Aedes aegypti accepted 
the bacteria and started to pass it to their off-spring. 
Were the earliest failures studied? 
Were any off or on-site mutations found? 
Did the disrupted genomes of eggs and sperm of the mosquitoes seek to repair 
itself? 
How were the failures disposed of? 
We don’t know the details, what protocols done? 
We remember social distancing which called for a 2 metre gap between us? Can the 
WHO share the scientific basis for this? 
What evidence for masks stopping the transmission of the virus? 
What samples did the WHO have or share of the Sars 19 virus and the strains of the 
pathogen that followed? 
What drove the weaker and stronger variants of the disease? 
When the WHO vaccinate in the middle of the pandemic, did your data suggest that 
vaccinating in the middle of a pandemic drove stronger variants? 
 
 What data was taken to assess the success? 
Why were ivermectin, Hydroxychloriquine, zinc, Vitamin D and Vitamin C not 
advised? 
Will doctors be able to prescribe or advise their patients to take simpler medicines 
food supplements instead of stronger pharmaceutical treatments advised by the 
WHO? 
Why was Mullion leaf taken off the shelves in the pandemic when well known to help 
respiratory disorders 
Why was Abate detergent taken off the shelves when Aedes aegypti mosquitoes 

were set to be released the next week, when Abate was the only detergent strong 
enough to kills the eggs? 
Why are Merck, producers of the HPV vaccine donating a million doses of 
ivermectin, an anti parasitic drug to treat Filarial Disease, caused by Wolbachia, at 
the same time as releasing Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes? 
Does a vaccine work if it is created to develop antibodies to the one strain produced 
as a Potential Pandemic Pathogens but it is used to address a slightly different 
mutation of a disease in Nature that actually caused the outbreak? 
If it is the same strain as the PPP that is engineered, will that show where the 
research was done? 
Will that point to a biosafety leak rather than a pandemic risk? 
Would it be a more consistent prevention to ban genetic research into 
pharmaceuticals, food, agriculture, CCS and other biotech? 
 
 
Notice 2) When one country is endangered by the WHO's biotechnologies, they put 
all Member States at risk 
- for example AUKUS US, UK, Australia Nuclear Submarines partnership destined to 
make Indonesia a target by sailing around in their waters. 
Stop The Retaliatory Deployment by AI of Mosquitoes, bombs and unlawful civil 
decision-making involvement.  
WHO's Thin Veneer of Health Strategy Turns To Beat Into Submission 
Please help stop the WHO’s Violent Retaliation In Their War Against Humanity 
 
Stand together or be taken out by the silent killers of the World Health Organization's 
Design 
 
The day Bali won the postponement of the mass release, an Indonesian Hospital in 
Palestine was bombed. There are no coincidences in this life. Countries have to stick 
together and recognise en masse what the UN and WHO intend and how they 
behave when they're asked even some basic house-keeping questions. Since 
artificial Intelligence was designed and utilised by the military, Israel proudly 
announced it can identify 100 civilian targets a day, and bomb 50 of them, limited 
only by ammunition. Before AI, only 50 civilian targets a year could be identified. 
There is no human oversight as to the legitimacy of the targets. The AI identifies any 
sort of ‘signature group’ - which is just everyone who may be objecting to the 
bombing, or objecting to any other deployment of military technology in 
pharmaceuticals or other engineered biological organisms such as mosquitoes. 
 
Do not accept the COP28 Conference of the Partiies - Look At What They're Calling 
‘Health’ and How We Will Be Financing This Totalitarian Nightmare  
 
The Health Minister should have answered questions of Criminal Ministerial 
Responsibility in Parliament, last Thursday. It would have brought Indonesia's whole 
acceptance of the WHO's regulatory approvals, let alone international mandates into 
doubt (Case Against the Health Minister attached) 
 
Now we need international intervention to even stop the mosquitoes 
The research into Wolbachia Mosquitoes as a Health Strategy was already a 
scandal - A gene drive of a disease vector with a gain of function, undisclosed 

inclusion of IP Technology, and the absence of credible risk analysis. 
https://healingbyfranc.blogspot.com/2023/12/mosquito-safety-and-efficacy-trials.html 
 
Indonesia's Minister of Health has violated the law by allowing a high impact 
experimental project without agreement by Indonesia's Coordination Committee. He 
should help Indonesia's authorities understand the money that changed hands and 
help to explain military engagement with the WHO. 
https://healingbyfranc.blogspot.com/2023/12/analysis-of-who-and-military-
relations.html 
 
Instead of answering difficult questions in front of the ix Commission, 
https://healingbyfranc.blogspot.com/2023/12/due-diligence-qus-nations-must-unite-
to.html 
Scott O'Neill, patent holder of the Wolbachia Technology and founder of World 
Mosquito Program, was invited to defend the health minister at the hearing (despite 
the criminal investigation into his World Mosquito Program filed in Bali). 
 
In a scandalous turn around, the parliament threw its support behind the WMP, 
despite vehement protests from the public where more than 60,000 had signed a 
petition asking for a postponement of the release: 
https://healingbyfranc.blogspot.com/2023/12/mosquito-due-diligence-petition-
that.html 
 
And despite the Governor's explicit statement to halt the mosquito release plan in 
Bali. 
https://healingbyfranc.blogspot.com/2023/12/balis-governor-president-at-first.html 
In what can only be called a frightening act of retaliation, the Health Minister is 
resuming releases, even making Bali a new headquarters for the World Mosquito 
Program and now introducing children's vaccines. 
https://healingbyfranc.blogspot.com/2023/12/who-retaliation-childrens-vaccine-
for.html 
 
There is already evidence of releases without any permission, releases on armed 
forces, and mass drops of adult mosquitoes on festivals. 
 
Two days ago I served notice on the Director General of the WHO, demanding the 
WHO's scientists support their pandemic preparedness and emergency response 
treaty with a solid foundation in science (Notice 1 above) 
 
Now I do not believe they intend to. The WHO hope that the treaty comes in using 
their “silent process”, where nations that fail to actively withdraw, will find their 
government’s own policies fully entangled in a web of self-destruction. 
 
What are your health ministers doing in your country? To your people?  
 
This is the only moment of choice Member States have and Indonesia already needs 
support.  
 
Please communicate between Defence Departments. Ask them to make the 
statement that when one country is endangered by the WHO's biotechnologies, they 

put all Member States at risk. 
 
Can Nations unite to STOP The WHO? 
 
I appeal to the Defence Departments in all UN member states to find unity, while our 
countries face the same biosecurity threat: The World Health Organization. 
 
Eleven countries withdrew from the WHO Treaty in September.  
Several more have rejected the International Health Regulations in the last week, 
coming up to the WHO's silence 1st December deadline. 
We need these brave nations to share as many of their reports as possible, detailing 
their reasons for walking away from the major Pandemic Fund payments. 
How did scientists convince their governments at last that gene edited organisms are 
NOT substantially equivalent to organisms that have evolved over 300 billion years? 
 
Did they see through the science, and realize that even biotechnology that is 
"researched for the benefit of world health" carries incalculable counter-indications, 
with other technologies and our microbiome? 
 
Did they raise the alarm that even the interaction between all the technologies in 
agriculture, food, conservation, climate action, pharmaceuticals and communications 
have already triggered mass destruction.  
Or did they find irrefutable evidence that the health measures that the World Health 
Organization propose are intended to harm? 
 
This intention to cause harm is the scandal that we discovered in Bali. We asked 
about the risks of releasing 200 million male and female mosquito eggs here. We 
asked about the safety of a gene drive that carries one bacteria on purpose but 
transmits 11 new diseases; We asked why the mosquitoes will carry IP Technology; 
and why did the WHO use a Microsoft modeling program to do a risk assessment, 
instead of doing a proper one? 
 
Did they answer our questions? NO 
Do they intend to punish Indonesia? Yes  
In a defiant act of retaliation, the World Mosquito Program plan to move their Head 
Quarters to Bali and resume their mosquito releases all over Asia, Mexico, Brazil and 
Africa. 
 
This is even though the health minister knows there is going to be a loss of life. 
Already a child dead from Japanese Encephalitis, never before seen here. And the 
following day? All children under 15 must take a vaccine.  
 
The response is indicative of what will happen with every lockdown and protracted 
crisis the WHO have planned. They will offer vector or vaccine. An Impossible choice 
and, in reality, no choice at all.  
 
Like the MEP's court case challenging the legality and legitimacy of the WHO, many 
in Indonesia, from Bali and Jakarta, from holy Mangku to General are committed to 
refusing their dangerous technologies. 
 

Please find a way to stand side by side with our General Komjen. Pol. Drs. Dharma 
Pongrekun, S.H. M.M., M.H., and so with Indonesia. Then we will stand with you and 
honour the spirit of your nations, and help your land and people recover. 
 
Just today, another child vaccine, this time for Dengue, is being rolled out on 
Kalimantan - the new WHO-controlled Smart capital city of Indonesia and yet original 
land of Indonesia's most longstanding traditional medicine and... of course some 
gold, uranium and other precious resources that presumably they have their eye on 
as well. 
 
The WHO start with strategic attack and inflict only tragedy. 
 
Please stop, thank you, Frances 
On behalf of humanity 
 
Attached:  Civil Case against the Health Minister 
“Number INV/2023/NW/1 
Subject: Application for Administrative Objection to the action of disseminating 
disease-causing biological agents that have the potential to cause outbreaks and 
epidemics (Wolbachia Mosquitoes) 
Dear. Mr. Budi Gunadi Sadikin, 
Minister of Health of the Republic of Indonesia  
Those who sign the attachment "petition participants", hereinafter referred to as "the 
applicants", in this case request the Honorable Mr. Budi Gunadi Sadikin, as Minister 
of Health of the Republic of Indonesia, to immediately revoke the Decree of the 
Minister of Health Number HK.01.07/ MENKES/1341/ 2022 and stop (temporarily) all 
actions to disseminate disease-causing biological agents that have the potential to 
cause outbreaks and epidemics, especially mosquitoes modified with Wolbachia 
bacteria (hereinafter referred to as "Wolbachia Mosquitoes") or other modified/ 
engineered living creatures. 
1. Factual Basis 
Specifically regarding the Wolbachia Mosquito program, the applicants have 
identified the following factual problems and deficiencies: 
- There is no AMDAL (Environmental Impact Analysis) and related permits for the 
Wolbachia Mosquito program, while AMDAL and related permits are legally required 
for "activities whose results can affect the natural environment, the built environment, 
as well as the social and cultural environment;" and/or “introduction of types of 
plants, animals and microorganisms;” 
- The Minister of Health does not have the authority to permit or order activities that 
impact the environment/ecosystem - Local research in a small area in Yogyakarta 
has become the basis for the national Wolbachia Mosquito program. Research 
conducted by the University of Jember (Genetic Variation of Aedes Aegypti (Diptera: 
Culicidae) 
based on DNA Polymorphism) for example shows the high level of genetic diversity 
in the Aedes Aegypti population, meaning that the results of research in one small 
area cannot necessarily be compared to the results in other areas, research results 
in Yogyakarta, its validity must first be proven in Aedes aegypti populations in other 
target areas. 
- Manipulated and incomplete Risk Assessments, potential negative impacts on 
health and the environment were insufficiently researched and excluded - 

Various studies that have formed the basis for the Wolbachia Mosquito program 
were published in Journals that were not recognized (even banned) by BRIN 
Jakarta, December 8 2023 
- The Ministry of Health sides with groups with an interest in the Wolbachia Mosquito 
program rather than being neutral - 
Unilateral invitation from Commission IX of the DPR to the Minister of Health which 
includes Scott O'Neill, Director of WMP who plans to spread 200 million Wolbachia 
infected mosquitoes, in Bali 
- Correlation is not causation, dengue fever decreases in Yogyakarta (77%) which 
claimed to be "due to" the Wolbachia Mosquito program could have occurred due to 
other causes such as conventional mosquito control methods, climate or other 
natural cycles. For example, in Bali dengue fever has also decreased/varied 
drastically, similar to Yogyakarta, without the presence of Wolbachia mosquitoes: 
- Results abroad are not clear, for example in Sri Lanka the dengue fever rate has 
tripled since the Wolbachia Mosquito program was introduced, in Singapore (a very 
extensive Wolbachia mosquito program) the dengue fever rate has also increased 
and the NEA (National Environment Agency) admits that the program is still in 
progress. the experimental phase with many challenges although it started in 2016. 
NEA Singapore has also noticed changes in the phenotype of the dengue virus 
during trials which may be caused by the presence of the Wolbachia mosquito - A 
comprehensive study on the 
issue of evolution (Wolbachia versus dengue: Evolutionary predictions) came to the 
conclusion that the short-term benefits of the wolbachia method are promising, but 
the long- term impacts and risks are unknown: “our analysis suggests that the 
possible benefits of this technology outweigh the negative impacts, but the true risks 
are largely unknown” 
- A study (Reduced competitiveness of Wolbachia infected Aedes aegypti larvae in 
intra- and inter-specific immature interactions) has found that Aedes aegypti infected 
with Wolbachia is weakened thereby reducing their competition with other species, 
such as Aedes albopictus which is also a vector for dengue fever and various viruses 
others, which can lead to an increase in other mosquito populations. 
- A study (Wolbachia Enhances West Nile Virus (WNV) Infection in the Mosquito 
Culex tarsalis) has found that infection with Wolbachia bacteria increases the level of 
West Nile virus infection in Culex tarsalis mosquitoes. The same/similar risks have 
not been studied enough in the Wolbachia-borne Aedes aegypti mosquito program in 
Indonesia 
- The Ministry of Health ignores the community's substantial and well-founded 
objections and concerns 
- Undue and unreasonable foreign influence, for example World Mosquito 
Programs funded by various controversial entities such as Bill & Melinda Gates 
Foundation 
- Import of Wolbachia mosquito eggs from Australia is suspected without permits and 
procedures applicable biosecurity (LARTAS) 
- Violation of the basic principles of informed consent (consent based on complete 
information), risks are hidden by the Ministry of Health and only benefits are 
promoted to the public 
- There is no clear responsibility and provisions regarding compensation for damage/ 
losses caused by the Wolbachia Mosquito program - Violation of regional autonomy 
for the environment and tourism, negative impact on tourism - Many or even most 
people reject the Wolbachia Mosquito program or feel unsafe and/or comfortable 

with the presence of the Wolbachia Mosquito, this fact has become clear from the 
national and international reaction to the Wolbachia Mosquito program. Local 
residents have no choice if the Wolbachia Mosquito is released without their consent 
in their area, however national and international tourists can and will choose to avoid 
the area which will cause (significant) harm to the tourism industry in the area.

I hereby give all parties notice to cease and desist and step down from holding 
office. 
This is my third and final notice for misguiding the public, in regards to safety and 
efficacy, and avoiding liability. 
This requires a response within 10 days of receiving this notice, latest 15th April 
2024. 
This is the third time I have formally served you notice for crimes against humanity, 
the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and abuse of the Nuremburg Code. 
These crimes are the offensive and allegedly defensive use of biological, 
radiological, chemical and nuclear armaments against men and women, directly and 
through mismanagement of the public purse, under the headings ‘deterrent’ and 
‘preparedness’. 
All Member States have been registered as corporations, but now there has been 
both domestic and foreign attacks upon nations through these corporations,.We 
hereby inform you that therefore we are enacting national emergency laws. These 
are distinct from the emergency measures that the UN and WHO themselves 
propose to declare at a moments’ notice. As you declare Health Emergencies of 
International Concern that require the extraction of national assets, we the people 
declare an international emergency of your fraudulent self-appointment and require 
that you step down before May 2024. What is happening now, is a transfer of power 
back to men and women. All the above parties are corporations and are defacto, and 
not de jure. This is because authority has been assumed without oaths of office. 
These oaths would acknowledge that the positions are those of public servants, with 
liability for acting in the public interest. 
The employment of technologies, the consequences of which are beyond human 
understanding, can never be considered to have received informed consent. Parties 

have sought experimental permits instead of attempting regulation. Parties have 
argued that gains of function and engineered mosquitoes are substantially equivalent 
to natural pathogens and insects, instead of attempting to monitor the outcomes of 
these experiments. 
 
In line with the Common Law Jurisdiction of the Land and Soil, my first notice was a 
Conditional Acceptance of the Program and Treaty. The conditions were that we 
must receive satisfactory answers to financial and operational due diligence 
questions and the question of liability. Although given ample opportunity, including 
parliamentary hearings, stakeholder meetings, written and in-person requests from 
National Security, lawyers and even Heads of State, not one direct answer was 
received from any of the defendants. Although 157 of 194 UN Member States 
rejected the Amendments or placed reservations in time; before the 1st December 
2023, not one of these official notices has been acknowledged. These notices were 
formally sent from multiple strata of society; governments, nations, lawyers, doctors, 
men and women and groups. Inevitably, as Common Law and Trust Law were never 
taught, any mistakes in these notices you have received, should have been 
overlooked, and the key concerns addressed. 
 
The second notice identified multiple points of law upon which the IHR, IHR 
Amendments, Treaty, and COP28 financing and negotiations were found to be 
illegitimate. The notice identified massive over-extension of jurisdiction and powers 
that were never formally agreed or adopted. Not only is there no oversight of the 
World Health Organisation and United Nations but all the parties served here are 
unwilling to be challenged, even if their proposed measures are clearly proven and 
intended to harm. The parties have a sinister protocol of retaliation in place, whereby 
undisclosed releases and the sterilisation of whole populations is carried out. 
Retaliation is the only response men and women and whole nations have received, 
when they refuse the products on health, safety or sovereignty grounds. Member 
states have no recourse to remedy. They have essentially been writing to a hostile 
corporate occupation of their nation. Actions have been taken. Member states have 
withdrawn, rejected and made formal reservations. More importantly millions of men 
and women have notified the parties of injuries and deaths. Parties have received 
notices from surviving men and women of our corrected political status, who have 
taken on the task of bearing witness. 
We are in Propria Persona Sui Juris (of one’s own right). In Proprio Solo (In the soil 
on one’s own land) and in Proprio Heredes (heirs of our own property) and we are 
exercising all our rights at this time and at all points on time. We are stewards of the 
animals including all the natural predators of the mosquito. We do not consent to any 
genetic modification. We do not recognise your authority, and all your technology 
must now be removed, on account of it being trespass. We claim the usury slavery 
system tantamount to aggravated burglary, causing grievous bodily harm. Failure to 
understand our interaction with the environment will not be considered justification of 
damage done or impacting life from a distance, with chemical deposits, engineered 
contamination or military artificial intelligence. 
The parties charged have a long history of programs that are neither safe nor 
effective. A Grand Jury of the People has already determined that there is sufficient 
evidence to indict every government official, corporate entity, philanthropist, or 
anyone else involved, for trying to bring fraud, treason and genocide into 
international law. 

The parties are also charged with a crime of omission, which is their silent process. 
This means that laws and amendments are considered adopted, if member states do 
not actively reject them. Today, we have a situation where member states have not 
acquiesced, they have actively rejected them. So now the parties are implementing 
programs without consent. As per the Nuremburg Code, the continuation of an 
experiment after the participants have suffered and called for its cessation is an act 
violence. 
We are determined that our counter presentations will now be heard in the 
International Criminal Court, where a first major case against the parties has been 
accepted. These counter presentations re-direct all pandemic fund money and other 
assets in to safe avenues for sovereign redress to men and women. We are the 
body sovereign and the parties are the body politic. We the people direct the public 
servants and will correct this systemic dishonourable conduct. 
 
Therefore, we demand the men and women of the parties acting in bad faith to 
resign and apologize, and 
your prompt response by no later than 22nd March 2024 to inform us of your 
intentions regarding our demands. 
We are escalating this matter in spiritual unity with all nations. We do not consent 
and we will not comply. 
Use of our data is illegal. Ref. GDPR and Data Protection Act, Article 22. 
 
Contracts Void 
The charges of fraud, genocide and use of bioweapons that the parties are faced 
with, in the International Criminal Court, renders all contracts, agreed due to this 
misrepresentation, as void. The parties have not provided proof of their legitimate 
authority or any financial or operational due diligence. The conflicts of interest 
demonstrate a monopoly, and AI-Driven Conflict upon humanity. As a precedent for 
this charge, Microsoft were sued by the USA for Monopoly in 2003. This time though 
we don’t want him to simply repackage his business and launder his money through 
philanthropies. The parties assets must be seized. 
 
 Men and women have made no contract with the parties. We have seen no Deeds 
of Assignment or active ingredients to allow independent testing. In fact, we have 
seen no supporting evidence for the scientific foundation for pandemic 
preparedness, and no justification or apology for the adverse events following each 
recommendation by the WHO during the pandemic and dating back 60 years. This 
confirms complicity with a larger program of pre-meditated harms, engineered 
enslavement of the rightful heirs of the land, and hopes of world domination. 
For myself, I am accepting of all and any mistakes made in this notice and reserve 
all rights. In addition, ORDINANCE NUMBER IRM/8266-ADIR04/I.RM28- G.WAC77- 
NWA0002, which is an irrevocable and non-negotiable document, in full force and 
effect issues men and women with honourable diplomatic immunity 
as HONOURABLE DIPLOMATS and PEACE AMBASSADORS. 
Lord Coke, the draftsman of the Petition of Right, stated clearly: 
“In many cases, the common law will control Acts of Parliament, and sometimes 
adjudge them to be utterly void: for when an Act of Parliament is against common 
right and reason, or repugnant, or impossible to be performed, the common law will 
control it and adjudge such an Act to be void.” 
page4image127695488 

Failure to comply with these demands will force us to hold you personably liable 
through the International Criminal Courts at The Hague, to protect people, animals 
and the environment. This notice to cease and desist specifically prohibits you from 
producing, transporting, deploying or releasing any modified vectors, administering 
any experimental vaccines or building any biological laboratories. In relation to the 
parties with fiscal responsibilities, they are hereby prohibited from trafficking men 
and women, extortion through the creating of bonds for minor violations and crippling 
economies through alleged national debts. 
As outlined in Common Law, men and women should be paid $10,000 Federal Gold- 
backed, American dollars (and not Fiat Money) per hour of unlawful capture. The 
Indonesian Jural Assembly judges that the parties charged should facilitate 
payments to all Indonesian men and women, with immediate effect. This is an 
appropriate first remedy and redress for the treasonous capture of the population, 
through the parties’ lockdown mechanism. Compensation would acknowledge the 
severity of the Health Minister of Indonesia’s impositions upon the population, the 
punishing length of the lockdown’s duration, and callous prevention of access to 
basic needs and complete lack of financial provision made for the people. There 
must be another fee paid for the hostile deployment of engineered mosquitoes, and 
another for the injection of experimental vaccines on children, and another for the 
attempted coup of creating smart Cities using artificial Intelligence, for which the 
parties will exclusively own the equipment and data garnered. We are holding an 
account of our individual fee schedules and holding the parties to account to pay 
them. 
You are hereby served notice that it is my intention to lay information in a Private 
Criminal Prosecution against the parties charged, alleging that the following 
trespasses and crimes have been committed against the people, in the Common 
Law jurisdiction of land and soil. 
Criminal Charges Below 
Social conflict arises from a struggle for agency. Now, men and women have taken 
on the risk of self-governance because the options seem very unappealing. The 
parties charged will not be allowed to take our freedoms or our lives. They must 
consider themselves served and likely to be found guilty. 
In the World Mosquito Program risk assessment, generated by an arm of the World 
Health Organization, using AI, they identified 54 potential risks. Their calculation find 
all the risks negligible. The assessment concludes that a program must be stopped if 
the risks are shown to be higher. Contained in the following chapters of this book of 
evidence are the 100 notices, reports and formal letters that demonstrate 
dangerously high risks on all accounts. The continuing of the deployments now, after 
they have been refused, sets a precedent for all the unwelcome Biolabs proposed. 
The multiple class actions amount to a world-wide veto on the activities of the parties 
charged. They 
page5image126982656 page5image126982864 
provide grounds for their consequential punishment and full personal liability. Cease 
and desist. 
Notice to be presented, with the investigation file, to all court cases and hearings 
emerging from this landmark Proliferation of Bioweapons case, and made available 
for other nations to support related cases: STPL/1263/X1/2023/ SPKT/Polda Bali 
I, Frances, of Gladiator Bangsa, am writing to the man, Mohamed of the Ali family, 
sometimes acting as Police Officer in Kepolisiian Negara Republik Bali. I have 
chosen to write in honour to a natural man, who we spoke to personally. I am also 

cautious of addressing this notice to a more senior police officer, as the Bali Police 
are implicated as well, as named stakeholders of the mosquito program. In addition, 
when we attended the police station to file charges we were told at first that the 
Police `intelligence and Health Officer did not know about the release and then they 
disclosed that they already had an open file and investigation. As stakeholders have 
been in receipt of 40 million Australian Dollars to allow the private Australian release, 
of Wolbachia IP Technology-infected Mosuquitoes, some police may already be in 
receipt of bribery money. 
We were grateful to meet you,Mohamed, after meeting the Head of Intelligence, 
Head of Health and several other officers in the police station. In future, you may be 
asked to bear witness to how the risks presented by the mass mosquito release 
were taken very seriously at the police station. You will remember how promises 
were made that the threats would be immediately be brought to the attention of the 
Biohazard Containment Department. You will recall how it was promised that the 
eggs would be confiscated and instruction be given for the safe decommissioning of 
the Denpasar laboratory and factory. You may be asked to confirm that the police did 
not afterwards order that action and you may be asked why. Please confirm that this 
affidavit will be added to the file and its contents be studied as part of the 
investigation. 
 
When the case is finally heard in the National and International Criminal Courts, we 
intend to use the precedent Case and Contract law from the closing of a laboratory 
on biosafety grounds, by the Ministry of Health in 2008. https:// www.cidrap.umn.edu/ 
avian-influenza-bird-flu/supari-accuses-rich-nations- creating-viruses-profit You will 
read that the former health ministers concerns were brought to realisation by the 
parties charged. 
I hereby submit this affidavit to provide the Facts, Legal Basis and Evidence of the 
crimes and victims of the parties’ premeditated and sustained biological attack on the 
people. The program was allowed through Fraudulent Misrepresentation (23 
accounts of Untrue Public Information) 13 pages of which is to follow in the Annex. 
There was widespread bribery of Bali’s local government and regulators by the 
private foreign funders, private families, and undisclosed contracts. We the people 
have now elevated the charge of Criminal Ministerial Misconduct to premeditated 
Grievous Bodily Harm, 
through the aforementioned parties contriving Emergency Measures. The release of 
foreign, experimental, and novel vectors and vaccines are technically the release of 
Gain of Function Potential Pandemic Pathogens. Genetic Engineering Experiments 
being tested on healthy populations is contrary to the Nuremberg Code, prohibiting 
Human Experimentation without Informed Consent. 
 
I was invited to join the Gladiator Bangsa leadership group to categorically 
demonstrate that all gene edited organisms and microorganisms carry the same high 
risks for people and the environment. Misrepresented as therapeutic, conservation, 
and surveillance measures, the biotech all generates the same profits and political 
power for pharmaceutical industry and military. I was prepared to accept that; once 
the risks of genetic engineering medicines, ‘green’ and wifi technologies, were 
understood, the deployment of Wolbachia bacteria-infected mosquitoes would be 
stopped and the eggs safely destroyed. To accomplish this, I prepared several 
papers for the Health Minister and Defense departments. I presented and discussed 
the bioweapons threat at a webinar, and wrote to the Bali stakeholders. I also gave 

notice to all the Member States Heads of State and Defense Departments that 
national security for their nations was about to pass to the WHO, through their IHR 
and Treaty. Only the National Security responded. They had not even been informed 
of the program. Simultaneously, the relationship between Save The Children Fund, 
Indonesia’s Armed Forces, and the WHO, orchestrated with the Minister of Defense 
and Minister of Health, will raise the profile of this case and for other Ministers and 
Plenipotentiary Ambassadors in related cases, to charges of Treason. (Ref WHO, 
Save The Children Fund and the Indonesian Armed Forces Report by Gladiator 
Bangsa. WHO Website: https:// extranet.who.int/emt/content/indonesian-armed- 
forces: Putting the policing of fabricated ‘protracted crises’ under the control of 
foreign military technology and armaments. 
 
Once our Class Action succeeded in getting the the Bali release postponed, we 
alerted Indonesia’s President, Indonesia’s WHO ‘Working Group’ as co-chairs with 
the US, and all the other UN Member States, about the International Health 
Regulation Amendments. In particular, I highlighted that Health Ministers may not be 
informing even their Heads of State, National Planning or Security departments 
about the WHO’s High Impact Pandemic Preparedness Treaty. Governments around 
the world have been lobbied to think that the building of bio-labs for pathogens, 
human DNA, pharmaceuticals and vectors would lead to some sort of ‘equity’ in 
terms of access to medical supplies (Ref: Gladiator Bangsa Report on 
Misrepresentation of Equity). To the contrary, biotechnology laboratories are 
impossible to regulate or maintain biosafety hav. They have already led to intentional 
and unintentional releases of toxic agents. Worse again, the IHR and Pandemic 
Treaty both relinquish responsibility for each country’s national security to the WHO. 
The WHO, UN and WEF are already proven to have major conflicts of interest and 
influence from their private funders (Ref: COI Report) In addition, the spread of 
biological contamination is unpredictable and irreversible. When biotech is coupled 
to military artificial intelligence, smart infrastructure (cities), disease vectors, 
pathogens themselves, and even men and women are controlled by foreign 
technology, 
with unknown capacity and unknowable consequences (reference Patents on the 
computerisation of the human body against every human rights principle). 
I identiied the UN Member States’ health ministers, as they are also delegates to the 
World Health Assembly. I warned about the public funds, natural resources and the 
Pandemic Fund that delegates will control after International Health Regulation 
Amendments, Pandemic Treaty and Sustainability Goal mandates come into law. 
Indonesia’s Health Minister, who is a business man rather than a doctor, described 
the Treaty as “a huge business opportunity.” (Reference: 75th World Health 
Assembly). The IHR, WHO implementation of radiation-causing technologies and 
infrastructure nor the mass releases of mosquitoes have not been discussed by 
Bappenas, the National Development and Planning Agency and Coordination 
Committee. This is against Guideline Number 11 of 2017 Guidelines for Healthy 
Living Community (Ref: Salmon-Peraturan-Menteri-PPN-11-Tahun-2017) 
 
The parties charged with Fraudulent Misrepresentation: In funding, researching, 
producing, approving, mandating, selling, policing and deploying weaponised 
biotech, with intention to harm. The Fraudulent misrepresation is the perpetrating of 
the above crimes, under the pretexts of “Health Strategies” and contrived “Health 
Emergencies of international Concern” The outcomes are now clear, and the victims 

of these crimes all look to Indonesia and Bali in particular to use this case STPL/ 
1263/X1/2023/SPKT/Polda Bali as the precedent for many cases and proving 
personal liability of the parties. 
The Bali Case STPL/1263/X1/2023/SPKT/Polda Bali could be the Police 
Investigation, Government Negotiation and Class Action that could save Indonesia 
and the other Member States from this genocide and biological disaster. So many 
authorities, levels of government, education and universities, are complicit through 
their jobs and their research, that it might be wise to offer an amnesty for these 
witnesses to give testimony for this Public Interest Case. 
Health Minister had not even informed the Coordination ministers or National 
Security about the mass mosquito releases. He has still been unwilling to disclose 
the capacity of the Wolbachia IP Technology coupled with Microsoft CNN AI in the 
 
 mosquitoes. It is a foreign artificial intelligence biotech, with a patent on it that claims 
exclusive rights to the digital equipment and data arising from it. The Internet 
Protocol technology and AI are connected by US’ Microsoft-designed 5G networks 
and MMWave foreign smart infrastructure and cities, with undisclosed military 
capacity. Similar situations are faced in every member state, for example live 
parasite GMO vaccines for children in Africa, 20 years of engineered insects in the 
Kingdom of Hawaii. The undisclosed objectives are to seize control of and exploit 
nations, people, natural resources and extract wealth from the people, animals, land 
and marine environment. 
In support of such an amnesty (Reference Gladiator Bangsa report of Open Science 
Manifesto) I was prepared to accept that individual research projects were 
undertaken in the belief that they were producing something beneficial. 
 
Once it was understood that many technologies being implemented at once could 
interact and inadvertently impact life, as a weapon of mass destruction, it should 
have been stopped. I served notice on all the parties charged, with this information, 
in the form of over 80 Due Diligence Questions. 
Social Conflict is defined as ‘the struggle to retain agency’, and involves the 
Constitutional right men and women have to make decisions and have control over 
their own lives, bodies, environment and work. Save The Children Fund were 
unqualified to implement the release, especially for a foreign agent when the charity 
are simultaneously deeply involved in implementing Indonesia’s military partnership 
with the WHO. The World Mosquito Program have been allowed to distribute 
mosquito eggs carrying Wolbachia IP technology, patented to the CEO Scott O’Neill. 
Furthermore, the IP Technology is coupled with artificial Intelligence, patented and 
controlled by Bill Gates, and it follows a military retaliatory protocol. This is seen in its 
use by Israel and retaliations on Bali after the first postponement (ref; Second Notice 
to the Charged Parties. The first social conflict was a major rift between Indonesian 
national defence and politics. The first man under investigation for these charges 
was unexpectedly invited to support the Indonesian Health Minister when he was 
called to defend his actions in front of the ix Commission. A copy of this notification 
has also been sent to the Senate for the plenary hearing, to question Indonesia’s 
current Health Minister (Ref Somasi Menkes and Official Statement to Exit the WHO 
endorsed by the Senate). The handling of this case so far indicates that national 
decision-making for the public good is already under threat, if not lost. 
 
In regard to the International Decision making by the UN and WHO, there is undue 

financial influence at play. The former Health Minister claimed that the US and the 
WHO were collecting deadly Bird Flu pathogen samples, conspiring to profit from 
H5N1 vaccines. Even then, in 2008, it was clear that the WHO intended to produce a 
biological weapon with the H5N1 virus. https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza- 
bird-flu/supari-accuses-rich- nations-creating-viruses-profit. Now we see Jeremy 
Farrar manoeuvred into position as Head Scientist at the WHO. Also in 2008, 
Jeremy Farrar was running a Tropical Diseases unit in Vietnam connected to Oxford 
University, realising his concept of GMO mosquitoes. He taught both Oxitec and 
World Mosquito Program scientists. Simultaneously in 2008, he was developing a 
‘universal Avian Flu’ Vaccine. In 2013 he was involved in the Gain of Function 
research that made H5N1 transmissible to mammals. During the pandemic, as Head 
of Wellcome Trust he allocated 7 million pounds Stirling to Oxitec. Now in January 
2024, Jeremy Farrar made an announcement that the next pandemic will be an 
Avian Flu and said we must rush funds to develop a vaccine, before the disease 
evolves to infect humans. He already knows that pathogen has been created. He is 
now in a position to declare a pandemic, reject national responses, and mandate his 
patented vaccine for profit, across all member states. This is high treason. During the 
Covid debacle, we have already seen evidence that developed countries are 
creating new viruses as a means of building new markets for vaccines, exactly as 
former health minister, Dr Siti Fadilah Supari forecast. 
This prosecution is now urgent because the WHO Treaty and IHR Amendments 
could still pass into International Law in May 2024, despite unanimous refusal. 
Therefore I request a SP2HP Update on the 23 Charges of Untrue Public Information 
Filed Against Save The Children Fund and the World Mosquito Program on 8.11.23

Chapter One Book of Evidence, Frances 
inspired by The Peace Intention by Freya Lawton 

https://www.amazon.co.uk/Peace-Intention-Handbook-StillFlow-Way/dp/0957512740 
The UK, US and Israel have been charged with war crimes. The parties served 
notice here have been charged with Genocide and the Proliferation of Biological and 
radiological weapons and Genocide for the Covid 19 ‘vaccines’, in the International 
Criminal court. However, my objective is peace; which I believe can only be achieved 
by withdrawing from the WHO and UN Treaties. In addition, artificial intelligence 
must be disarmed, dismantled and then banned by stopping the rollout of 5G. Their 
interaction is no more and no less than a weapon of mass destruction, following a 
retaliatory military protocol. AI is an abuse of our privacy and humanity, through its 
corruption of humane decision- making. AI may be compelling and coherent, but it is 
devoid of affinity and empathy. Therefore it has no place in a just society, or in 
honourable international relations. The AUKUS nuclear partnership, between the US 
and UK to buy 8 nuclear submarines for Australia must be blocked, as a gross 
misuse of public money, or a privately-funded proliferation of nuclear weapons. 
AUKUS members are actively encouraged to befriend the President of Indonesia, 
“whoever is elected”. This can only be to maintain the presumed permission the US, 
UK and Australia will claim; to secretly sail the submarines all year-around, in 
Indonesian waters; exploit Indonesia’s nuclear resources and commandeer a 
strategic military position. 
 
My understanding is that if the WHO-approved production and deployment of 
hundreds of millions of biting, breeding mosquitoes is judged to be a hostile 
biological attack, by foreign agencies, the mosquitoes will be seen as weapons 
deployed offensively, by UN and American military, using Indonesia as a remote 
battle ground. It is my intention that this criminal case will provide a precedent to help 
Indonesia reject the IHR, the WHO’s other health strategies and the proposed 
proliferation of biolabs. These contravene the Biological Weapons Convention 
(BWC). Thirdly, if it is agreed that the experimental permits are a way for vaccines, 
vectors, fogging and other biotech to avoid meaningful regulation, future open-air 
trials can be refused. Pharmaceuticals and mosquito eggs have been exempt from 
import and export protocols. Intellectual property rights have protected the charged 
parties from all independent safety and efficacy testing. The parties being registered 
in Switzerland has led to indemnity. Those parties that do not have diplomatic 
immunity themselves have been offered legal protection by Microsoft. Despite 
350,000 signatures calling for a moratorium to be placed on gene drive research, the 
charged parties are now just denying that the releases are gene drives. 
This cease and desist notice is now being served on all producers of gene edited 
ingredients, in military, health, food agriculture and conservation. When I write notice 
to principal is notice to agent and notice to agent is notice to principal, it means that 
all agents are being made personally responsible too. These agents are complicit 
parties such as government ministers and Extraordinary Plenipotentiary 
Ambassadors who have misused their executive powers. 
The criminal charges filed at Bali Police Station, in Denpasar are important for 
Indonesia, to compensate cities that have already suffered a mass release. A jury’s 
decision would protect the human population, allowing nature, natural mosquito 
predators and all biodiversity to recover. In national and International presentations, I 
have proposed Indonesia as a suitable ‘control group’ for the One Health 
experiment. This would involve the rejection of all genetically engineered or other 
new technologies. This is what the Mangkus decreed as the only appropriate 
outcome (Ref. Statement, signed by 23 Mangkus sent directly to the WMP laboratory 

in Denpasar. 
 
The case is internationally important because African nations are facing an 
experimental Malaria ‘vaccine’ containing engineered live plasmodium parasites of 
the worst strain of Malaria. Maui and Hawaii are facing a 20-year litany of abuse. 
 
 Their own ministers have approved mass releases of multiple engineered insect 
species, in numbers over a billion. Great Britain has approved the rollout of 
neurotoxin Flouride in the water. There is promotion of experimental genetically 
modified cancer drugs and MMWave surveillance 5G networks. In each Member 
State, the bribery to obtain approvals are now being charged as treasonous. 
Definitely, many more parties will be dismissed for criminal ministerial conduct. 
The only way to stop the spread of a biological contamination is to scorch the earth. 
This has already happened in Maui. It is a matter of great concern that there is a 
pattern to intentionally render many paradise islands, and indeed the African 
continent and Palestine, as uninhabitable. This makes way for the extraction of 
wealth, when natural resources are claimed on a’ sustainability’ pretext by the UN 
and remaining populations moved into smart cities, as planned. 
194 member states are affected by the WHO’s Pandemic Preparedness Treaty but 
the WHO has already taken risk assessments out of the public domain. Therefore, 
these criminal cases must set a precedent and make them liable. WHO risk 
assessments are generated by AI. The Wolbachia Mosquitoes were studied at an 
Indonesian University to manufacture consent. The researchers were informed that 
they did not need to carry out a risk assessment process or review the one provided 
by the WHO. Truth-testing is when risks are assessed in open air trials. However, in 
the Yogyakarta Wolbachia Mosquito trials, none of the 54 risks were assessed. Only 
PCR testing was used to assess the presence of Dengue in the city after release, 
plus an archaic “capture and release” system to assess the spread of Wolbachia 
bacteria. The AI risk assessment concluded that all the risks were “negligible”. if any 
risk rose above “negligible”, the risk assessment document did promise that the 
program must be reviewed. Even when the trials were conducted the risks were 
already shown to be much higher. There was Social Conflict. Over a hundred people 
in the community formally opposed the releases. There was also a Class Action 
court case to try and stop the trials. This means that the risk of Social Conflict and 
Class Action, numbers 53 and 54 on the Risk Assessment were in fact very high. 
The following documents prove that there has been intense opposition, social conflict 
and class actions taken against all the parties charged. There has still been no 
review of the program and no direct answers to basic due diligence questions. For 
example: Why does the WMP call their mosquito program in Sri Lanka a success, 
when the cities who agreed the mass deployment of eggs in 2021, now have a world 
record level of Dengue Cases and a larvae crisis. The people are being further 
punished by the president of Sri Lanka mobilising their armed forces to track 
mosquito eggs and fine home owners for providing a breeding ground. 
 
Men and women have a Constitutional right to self determination and bodily integrity. 
No high impact project should happen in Indonesia without a meeting and consensus 
between the Coordination Committee, Bappenas. The World Mosquito Program 
should not have been enshrined in law. The GE mosquito program and GE 
‘vaccines’ constitute premeditated harms. This has been proved repeatedly. In 
particular, WMP scientists admitted that the laboratory- bred mosquitoes carry 11 

other diseases in addition to Wolbachia infection. WMP confirmed that other disease 
vector species massively increased and caused an outbreak of Japanese 
Encephalitis as a result of the Yogyakarta trials. WMP literature disclosed that the 
Wolbachia Bacteria has been engineered to carry a Technology patented by the 
founder of WMP, who will therefore directly profit. The WMP Scale Up report states 
that this is an Internet Protocol Technology. This means it is coupled to Microsoft 
CNN Artificial Intelligence, intended to deliver data and possibly instructions, via 5G 
and 6G networks. 5G itself is a foreign-controlled wireless network being built in to 
Indonesia’s new capital city. This smart infrastructure is known to irreversibly 
degrade human and environmental health. 
What would bring peace, specifically? Complete disarmament and apology, followed 
by redress and remedy. 
 
10th April Case to Stop The WHA, WHO, WEF, UN and Agents thereof and claim 
remedy through public banks 
I added: 
Visionary Financial Team Assembled 
We have assembled a team capable of establishing public banks and overseeing the 
financial due diligence of a compensation dispersement. 
It starts with Professor Richard Claproth who filed the criminal charges and has 
experience in bank management as well as still being in the government planning 
office. Also Dr Kun, expert in the dangers of AI and leading advocate for the workers 
union. Siti Fadilah Supari, Jendral Dharma Pongrekun - Indonesia’s chief of police, 
and all of Gladiator Bangsa will coordinate a better financial future. 
I also anticipate Pascal Najadi will participate (through his stop GMO group) and will 
bring discernment as to the extent that the old system is being dismantled, in his 
action to 1) ensure the arrest of the WEF, 2) widen the international pressure to stop 
the diplomatic immunity of the WHO and 3) help us in Indonesia, to structure the 
public banks, into which allegedly indebted member states can deposit and distribute 
their compensation, when the time comes. 
We have invited Harald Felzen of Sparkasse Public Bank's International 
Coorperation arm, with whom I was a government party working on the introduction 
of public banks in Ireland. 
Richard C Cook, who is a major champion for the end of Usury in the United States 
as well as being the man who presented evidence that blocked the weaponization of 
space in the past; 
Pierre Larrouturou, the MEP who went on hunger strike during the plandemic to 
insist that financial institutions pay even 0.01% tax on transactions. This was 
because all small businesses were being forced to invest in credit card machines to 
operate at all; 
Diarmaid Mulcahy chairman of MABs, money advice for men and women in personal 
debt, in the West of Ireland, who is another proponent of public banking and also EU 
candidate calling for a moratorium on 5G, on account of childhood cancers and other 
repercussions. 
Everyone in this group has additional extensive experience in health and connection 
and will extend an offer to work with and support families ruined by the death of the 
provider, to address damage done by the GMO jabs, or by the adverse effects of the 
lockdowns. 
I believe we have to tackle the alleged debts to the International Monetary Fund and 
other banking bodies, to help UN member states extricate themselves from the WHO 

Treaty. 
 
All the cases attached have capable lawyers who would be willing to give testimony 
on the invalidity and bioweapons aspects. The Treaty demands a great financial 
commitment and a commitment of member states' other resources. This is ten times 
what has been asked for in the past. Once we have thought of a new financial 
trajectory to actually incentivize local self sufficiency and environmental protection, 
we have the willing support of two groups of lawyers and the World Council For 
Health in building the cases. 
I served notice on the WHO before the 1st December 2023 deadline to reject the 
IHR, demanding due diligence in regard to their Gain Of Function and gene drive 
creation of Potential Pandemic Pathogens. Then I put the WHO on notice again for 
retaliating when Bali managed to get a postponement of the GM mosquitoes, that 
are being released. There is a great wave of resistance from many countries but 
countries that have withdrawn, rejected or expressed reservations about the 
Pandemic and SDG declarations have yet to be acknowledged at all by the WHO. 
Thank you,

Prevalence and Distribution of Dengue Virus in Aedes aegypti in Yogyakarta City 
before Deployment of Wolbachia Infected Aedes aegypti 
 
• 
We explored whether there was a temporal correlation between the 
prevalence of DENV infected Aedes aegypti and notified dengue cases reported by 
district health office (Figure 4). Twelve cases (IR 0.27/10,000) were reported from 
Yogyakarta City District Health Office during December 2015, and an increasing 
number were reported later. In January 2016, 89 cases were reported (IR 
2.15/10,000), 102 cases (IR 2.46/10,000), 132 cases (IR 3.19/10,000), 121 cases (IR

This study may act as important baseline data of circulating dengue virus serotypes 
in Yogyakarta City before the implementation of Wolbachia technology. ( 
As a promising candidate for dengue transmission control, Wolbachia-
infected Aedes aegypti may have an impact on the pattern of circulating dengue 
virus serotypes. Future study needs to address the role of environmental dynamics 
and dengue virus in areas dominated with Wolbachia-infected Aedes aegypti. 
 

https://ugm.ac.id/en/news/15142-dengue-fever-cases-in-yogyakarta-are-declining/ 
Dengue fever cases in Yogyakarta during 2017 experiences a significant decrease. 
There were 1,705 cases where 13 of them led to mortality in the previous year, while 
this October, there are 383 cases where 2 of them caused mortality. The decrease of 
those cases is mainly caused by the program of spreading Wolbachia mosquitoes 
which are implemented in 12 regions in Yogyakarta City since the middle of this 
year. The spreading of Wolbachia mosquitoes is still running until the end of 2019. 
 
Dengue Fever Cases in Yogyakarta are Declining? 
 
• 
However, the Head of Disease Control and Environmental  Health 
Yogyakarta, Yudiria Amelia, has yet to conclude that the decrease of dengue fever is 
caused by Eliminate Dengue Project (EDP) programme. According to Yudiria, the 
decrease of dengue fever cases is also influenced by the weather factor due to the 
uneven rainfall during the season. “We have yet to be able to conclude the cause of 
the decrease of the dengue fever cases, because this research has not finished yet. 
If we consider the uneven rainfall which is different from the previous years, I think it 
might be the factor that causes the decrease of the cases,” said Yudiria Amelia at 
UGM campus on Thursday (25/9).

Experimental Permits and the Nuremburg Code 
Frances’Analysis 
Contrary to Nuremburg Code 
Following the criminal behaviour of the Nazis during and leading up to WW2, a code 
of conduct was adopted and applies to the mosquito programs and WHO Treaty: 
 As a group of men and women bringing these charges to the police, we should not 
be expected to actually defend Indonesia against massive deployments of 
unregulated, genetically engineered biological agents, with intention to harm. We 
also should not have to warn the National Security department about allowing 
American AI technology to manage the infrastructure for the new capital.  
 
Nonetheless, this is my written evidence to do exactly that. We are being used as 
human experimentation subjects so the Nuremberg Code must be followed. 
Secondly, I will show that the production and release of toxic mosquitoes fits the 
United Nations’ own definition (1969) of weapons of mass destruction.   
 
The ten points of the code were given in the section of the verdict entitled 
"Permissible Medical Experiments": 
1. The voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential. 
Communities, Heads of local communities, government ministers and planning 
departments were not informed, consulted or consensus reached. Both WMP and 
WHO only pretend they have the “community acceptance” and “consensus” they 
need to proceed. Only promotional material was delivered by the WMP, in formal 
presentations and to home owners and other facilitators they wanted to to recruit. 
The hidden technology, risks, experimental permit, and dangerous failures of the 

trials and other releases were not disclosed.    
 
2. The experiment should be such as to yield fruitful results for the good of society, 
unprocurable by other methods or means of study, and not random and unnecessary 
in 
nature. 
 
Dengue cases were dropping anyway, without foreign biotechnology 
intervention. Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever was always very rare. Many increases in 
quality of life, screens for windows, water management, traditional medicines, and 
education for all, as to how to identify and dispose of mosquito eggs. To the contrary, 
two weeks before the release, the government withdrew Abate from the shops. 
Abate was the only detergent strong enough to kill the eggs of the Aedes Aegypti. 
The Ministry of Health shared the WHO narrative that the people have a choice 
between vectors or vaccines, and vectors are cheaper. This is a pharmaceutical 
industry business plan, not a strategy. 
 
The WMP were supported, trained, funded and their products approved by the 
WHO”s Chief Scientist and funder of Oxitec’s Genetically Modified Mosquitoes. 
Singapore manages mosquito breeding grounds by strict rules against uncovered 
water on people’s property. Two years after massive mosquito releases in Sri Lanka, 
there is a world record number of Dengue cases and a larvae crisis. The President 
has recently ordered the army to tackle the “protracted crisis”, track the eggs with 
drones and prosecute and fine the people in whose homes the eggs are found. Save 
The Children Fund UK are the main partners with Indonesia’s Armed Forces, 
responsible for the United Nation’s and World Health Organization’s response to 
‘protracted crises’ and Health Emergencies of International Concern.   
 
3. The experiment should be so designed and based on a knowledge of the natural 
history of the disease or other problem 
under study that the anticipated results will justify the performance of the experiment. 
Vector-borne diseases spread as female mosquitoes bite and feed on human blood 
to breed. There is no natural history of laboratory-made diseases. Gain of function 
research, adding a greater transmissibility or a more lethal strain, using genetic 
engineering, creates pathogens that could NOT have happened in nature. Wolbachia 
bacteria was not found in the Aedes Aegypti for the last 360 billion years (natural 
history of evolution) but the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and WMP smuggled 
nano surveillance technology into the bacteria, designed to transmit and receive 
information using wireless networks. This was done using gene editing. Then, they 
partnered with Yogyakarta, informing it was a natural and harmless strain, unrelated 
to Wolbachia in human Filarial disease, water-borne disease and fish and bird 
parasitic Wolbachia. Using thousands of automated micro-injections, another form of 
genetic engineering, WMP forced the bacteria, into the egg and sperm of the adult 
mosquitoes - possibly in  antibiotic resistant culture, until the mosquitoes survived 
and were able to breed and pass on the bacteria. They achieved manufactured 
consent in Indonesia through their funding of the University research but In Bali, the 
eggs were brought from Australia for breeding. In describing the ‘anticipated results’, 
WMP only claim that they have ‘promising’ results. They only used pop up clinics, 
PCR tests and ‘capture and release’ of a small number of mosquitoes, in the 
Yogyakarta trial of effectiveness. The risk assessment for the safety of releases was 
done exclusively by the WHO, using Microsoft artificial intelligence, in place of actual 
study and knowledge of the problem, and ignoring the short history of lab-produced 

organisms and microorganisms and the impossibility of regulating them as invasive 
species, or stopping the spread of contamination or the gene transfer to the human 
microbiome.    
 
4. The experiment should be so conducted as to avoid all unnecessary physical and 
mental 
suffering and injury. 
The increase in mosquito bites lowers people immune system function. This is 
intentional as the Gates Foundation research goal is for mosquitoes to deliberately 
deliver vaccines at the site of bites, straight into the bloodstream. This is stated in 
their 2003International health Goals, for which they opened open funding to the 
university in Yogyakarta. Human blood is the food nosqutoes need before producing 
eggs. They produce eggs three times in their lifetime, 100 each time. Even one 
mosquito can make it impossible to sleep  or relax and they can bite many times. 
The only way to avoid unnecessary suffering is to make sure they are not released at 
all.  The only recovery proposal from damage done already with biotech, is the 
organic farm system. Where land lies fallow and no experimental products are used 
for 6 years. By then land has been shown to recover and all traces gone. The mental 
anguish and physical effort of the men and women who found out about the 
mosquitoes just six week from the release date and the struggle for agency - social 
conflict in order to protect Bali and their own lives and livelihoods.  
 
5. No experiment should be conducted where there is an apriori reason to believe 
that 
death or disabling injury will occur; except, perhaps, in those experiments where the 
experimental physicians also serve as subjects. 
The WMP scientists admitted the mosquito eggs carried 11 other diseases in 
addition to the Wolbachia bacteria infection. They showed graphs and admitted they 
had known there was a spike in other dangerous mosquito species; the Culex and 
Anopheles, after the release of Aedes Aegypti. They admitted that, after the trials, 
the Culex species had caused an outbreak of Japanese Encephalitis, killing at least 
one child and life-threatening disabling injuries to at least four others. In response, 
the ministry of health immediately planned to administer a Japanese Encephalitis 
vaccine - another experimental biotech product - but thankfully it was stopped. 
Another a priori reason is that there is already a world-wide concern about gene 
drives and an agreement until recently that there should never be an open air 
release. Even a moratorium on gene drive research was demanded by conservation, 
food and health groups. Another A priori reason to believe that mass mosquito 
releases will cause death, is the Artificial Intelligence, which is a technology that has 
been programmed to the military protocol of retaliation. Furthermore, it is 
programmed to identify signature groups rather than legitimate targets and has 
raised the. Like the mosquitoes, AI is an indiscriminate weapon of war. The UN will 
know already that the 5G and 6G infrastructure is what is used to deliver data and 
that the data is ours but now it is the private property of someone else,  who carries 
an exclusive claim and patent.  
 
6. The degree of risk to be taken should never exceed that determined by the 
humanitarian 
importance of the problem to be solved by the experiment. 
The only problem being solved is how to strip developing countries of their natural 

resources. First the biotech undermines the health of the nation, then countries are 
coerced into exploiting their environment and handing the resources over as part-
payment of alleged national debts and to cover new financial obligations to the 
WHO.  Infant technologies including mRNA and live GMO parasite ‘vaccines, 
Internet Protocol Wolbachia method mosuitoes, IP Technology and wireless 
technologies rolled out simultaneously to surveillance and smart infrastructure are 
acting as one big weapon of mass destruction. The experimental permits are not 
awarded so that an experiment can be conducted. There are no placebos, there are 
no control groups that are not being subjected to the assault. As per the Nuremberg 
Code, a medical intervention can be charged as an assault, unless it is done with 
informed consent. Neither the WMP or SCF claim there will be any monitoring 
following their  ‘experiment’, let alone anyone taking any responsibility for damages. 
In Bali’s foreign-funded program the mosquitoes contain IP Technology which can 
see where the mosquitoes are and who they bite. No hospital or environmental 
protection agency will be given a sample of the mosquitoes, so that they can monitor 
its spread or appearance in public water or other species. An experimental permit is 
a legal instrument that now serves instead of meaningful regulation. Genetic 
engineering causes damage to the genome, and in its efforts to repair itself, it 
generates mutations, horizontal and inherited vertical gene transfer and 
unpredictable, unintended side effects. Even the basic import and export regulations, 
including no releases within 500 metres from a water course. In Indonesia, the 
Intelligence service have allowed in hundreds of millions of mosquito eggs, 500 eggs 
per small slip of paper.. Eggs that remain viable for over a year. There is no 
migration of mosquitoes due to climate change. The WHO and its funders are 
intentionally releasing them with impunity.   
 
7. Proper preparations should be made and adequate facilities provided to protect 
the 
experimental subject against even remote possibilities of injury, disability, or death. 
As with the WHO Treaty, there are no mechanisms for finishing the experiment and 
establishing its success. The WMP Risk Assessment and the WHO Treaty claim that 
if their products and recommendations do not achieve full acceptance by the 
community, or if any of the risks increase from ‘negligible’ the experiment must be 
stopped at work. Instead, there are no preparations in place. If Wolbachia-caused 
Elephantitis, River Blindness or Filarial disease become a problem, we will not be 
able to stop the mosquitoes on their breeding gene drive. When the IP Technology 
interacts with the new wifi frequencies, smart cities and other networks, an increase 
in radiating heat and widespread sickness follows. No research is being pursued in 
relation to the safety and efficacy of these interactions between new technologies 
and yet we feel them. People taking their own lives, arrhythmia of the heart, a 
diminishment of the microbiome of the eyes, migraines.  We do not consent to being 
experimental subjects. The Health Minister, WMP, are SCF are not even thinking of 
protecting life - they are philanthropic front for acts of war, genocide, and intend to 
render Bali uninhabitable. We have identified that the ‘new fogging solution’ which is 
also Australian in partnership with Indonesia’s government is biotech, with a 
biological action, and constitutes a poison that can be smoked into people’s home. 
There is the threat of curfews, so people stay inside away from mosquitoes. And the 
threat of mosquito-delivered vaccines, with no traceability. 
 
8. The experiment should be conducted only by scientifically qualified persons.The 

highest degree of skill and care should be required through all stages of the 
experiment of those who conduct or engage in the experiment. 
Save the Children Fund call themselves ‘the implementers’ of the program. WMP 
and Ministry of Health confirm that ‘the implementers’ are the organization that are 
formally liable for the mass mosquito releases and their consequences for human 
health, environment, water quality and loss of livelihoods and biodiversity. Save the 
Children Fund’s Chairman and Co-chairperson admitted they had no scientific 
qualification or even understanding of biotechnology or health. Save The Children 
Fund also do not have any military skill  
 
9. During the course of the experiment the human subject should be at liberty to 
bring the 
experiment to an end if he has reached the physical or mental state where 
continuation 
of the experiment seems to him to be impossible. 
Even massive conflict between National defence and politicians has not been able to 
bring the experiment to an end. Even when children died of Japanese Encephalitis 
as a result of the trial, it was not stopped. Even when communities have made 
petitions to local government begging them to stop the mosquito program, it was 
totally ignored.  
10.During the course of the experiment the scientist in charge must be prepared to 
terminate 
the experiment at any stage, if he has probable cause to believe, in the exercise of 
the good faith, superior skill and careful judgment required of him that a continuation 
of the experiment is likely to result in injury, disability, or death to the experimental 
subject. 
A release of biological organisms cannot be stopped, mosquitoes cannot be recalled. 
Gene drives are biotech that are designed to persist, by over-riding Mendelian 
Inheritance Laws of nature and passing even fatal traits to all offspring. Judgement 
of any trials or other releases show the parasites and symbiotic bacteria mutate and 
differentiate into dangerous variants of disease but WMP and Save The Children 
Fund determined to Scale Up the releases. 
 
While there is a risk, the Nuremburg Code states it would be a crime to impose upon 
an individual and their children against their will. 
In the 10th point specifically, it is a demonstrable crime that the WHO scientists have 
continued with these experimental releases at all. 
The Hippocratic Oath demands: First do no harm.

Critical Evaluation of Wolbachia Infection Study in Aedes aegypti in Yogyakarta 
By: Richard Claproth 
 
The preliminary study on Wolbachia infection in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in 
Yogyakarta, published in a journal that has been banned by BRIN due to perceived 
doubts, is titled "Prevalence and Distribution of Dengue Virus in Aedes aegypti in 
Yogyakarta City before Deployment of Wolbachia-Infected Aedes aegypti," which 
can be downloaded here. 
 

It should be understood that this research serves as the basis for spreading 
Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes in Indonesia. 
 
The critical opinions below not only focus on the research methodology but also 
extend to the overall project's aspects, given its serious implications for ecosystems 
and public health. Policymakers are urged to halt the spread of millions infected with 
Wolbachia in Indonesia. 
 
1. Methodological Limitations: 
 
• 
The study relies on the One-Step Multiplex Real-Time PCR method for 
dengue virus detection. The sustainability and validity of these results need further 
evaluation using additional methods and verification techniques. 
 
• 
One-Step Multiplex Real-Time PCR Method: This method has 
limitations in sensitivity and specificity. The study solely relies on one method for 
detecting dengue virus in mosquitoes. The use of additional methods, such as virus 
culture or alternative molecular methods, is needed to verify results and enhance 
confidence in the generated data. Due to method limitations, the sustainability of this 
study's results needs questioning. The addition of more valid methods and 
diversified detection techniques can provide a more accurate and reliable picture. 
This method is not sensitive enough to the genetic variations of the dengue virus that 
can affect detection results. The use of more advanced molecular techniques can 
address this uncertainty. Method limitations can trigger potential biases in result 
analysis. The addition of extra methods and verification techniques can help identify 
and reduce potential biases that may occur. 
 
2. Limited Sample Representation: 
 
• 
The taken samples may not adequately represent the environmental 
and condition variations throughout Yogyakarta City, which can influence result 
applicability at the national level. 
 
• 
The number of samples taken over five months does not cover 
sufficient variations in environmental and geographical conditions across the 
research area. The selection of locations and sample collection periods should 
reflect the diversity of conditions that may affect dengue transmission. 
 
3. Limited Duration: 
 
• 
Lack of Seasonal Variation Coverage: Five months is a short period to 
observe seasonal variations in dengue transmission and mosquito activity. This 
limited time overlooks fluctuations that can occur during the rainy and dry seasons, 
significantly impacting the reproduction and activity of Aedes aegypti. 
 
• 
Lack of Mosquito Life Cycle Coverage: The mosquito life cycle involves 
larval, pupal, and adult stages. Five months may not cover the entire life cycle, 
resulting in an inadequate understanding of how seasonal factors affect the 
reproduction and survival of Aedes aegypti. 
 
• 
Unobserved Variability in Mosquito Populations: The short study period 
may fail to capture changes in mosquito populations that can occur significantly over 
a longer period. Fluctuations in mosquito numbers can directly impact dengue virus 
prevalence. 
 
• 
Lack of Long-Term Pattern Identification: A five-month study does not 
provide a complete picture of the long-term patterns of dengue transmission. The 
long-term effects of environmental, climatic, and dengue transmission sustainability 

factors may not be fully revealed. 
 
• 
Inadequate Assessment of Epidemiological Dynamics: The limited 
duration does not allow for a comprehensive analysis of dengue epidemiological 
dynamics, including identifying long-term trends, transmission cycles, and evolving 
risk factors over time. 
 
• 
Inadequate Assessment of Epidemiological Dynamics: The limited 
duration does not allow for a comprehensive analysis of dengue epidemiological 
dynamics, including identifying long-term trends, transmission cycles, and evolving 
risk factors over time. 
 
4. Focus on Aedes aegypti: 
 
• 
The study focuses on Aedes aegypti, while Aedes albopictus can also 
be a potential vector. A comprehensive evaluation of the role of Aedes albopictus in 
dengue spread should also be considered. 
 
• 
Neglect of Aedes albopictus: The study exclusively focuses on Aedes 
aegypti, overlooking the potential role of Aedes albopictus as a dengue vector. 
Aedes albopictus is known as an alternative vector and can significantly contribute to 
dengue virus transmission. 
 
• 
Potential Inaccuracy of Information: Neglecting Aedes albopictus can 
lead to inaccuracies in understanding the dynamics of dengue transmission. 
Comprehensive information about both mosquito species is essential for planning 
and implementing effective control strategies. 
 
• 
Limited Impact on Dengue Control: The study's focus only on Aedes 
aegypti may limit the relevance of findings to overall dengue control efforts. Aedes 
albopictus should be comprehensively evaluated to understand the complete picture 
of dengue transmission risk. 
 
• 
Need for Evaluation of Aedes albopictus Role: A comprehensive 
evaluation of the role of Aedes albopictus in dengue spread should be the focus of 
further studies. Continued research should include identification, monitoring, and 
analysis of Aedes albopictus's contribution to dengue virus transmission. 
 
• 
Importance of a Multivector Approach: To fully understand the 
dynamics of dengue transmission, it is crucial to adopt a multivector approach that 
considers the relative contributions of both Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. 
Focusing only on one vector may overlook the actual variability and complexity in the 
dengue transmission ecosystem. 
 
5. Lack of Epidemiological Analysis: 
 
• 
The study has not provided a sufficiently in-depth epidemiological 
analysis regarding the correlation between dengue virus infection in mosquitoes and 
the number of dengue cases in humans. 
 
• 
Lack of Correlation Analysis: The study fails to provide adequate 
epidemiological analysis to explain the correlation between dengue virus infection in 
mosquitoes and the number of dengue cases in humans. This inability diminishes 
the understanding of the relationship between mosquitoes as vectors and the burden 
of dengue disease in the human population. 
 
• 
Limitations in Epidemiological Information: The lack of epidemiological 
analysis results in limitations in providing in-depth insights into the impact of dengue 
virus infection in mosquitoes on the occurrence of dengue disease in humans. This 
information is crucial for the development of control and mitigation strategies. 
 
• 
Lack of Presentation of Epidemiological Data: The study does not 

provide adequate presentation of epidemiological data, such as dengue incidence 
trends, seasonal patterns, and other epidemiological characteristics. This hinders the 
ability to make significant epidemiological inferences. 
 
• 
Absence of Risk Factor Analysis: More in-depth epidemiological 
analysis typically includes the identification of risk factors contributing to increased 
dengue cases. The study lacks information regarding these risk factors. 
 
• 
Unclear Implications for Control: Without adequate epidemiological 
analysis, the implications and relevance of the study's findings for dengue control 
and risk mitigation strategies become unclear. Effective control strategies require a 
comprehensive understanding of the epidemiological dynamics of the disease. 
 
6. Lack of Ecosystem Impact Assessment: 
 
• 
The ecological impact of spreading millions of Wolbachia-infected 
mosquitoes has not been adequately evaluated. Risks to the ecosystem and 
biodiversity need further analysis. 
 
• 
Unevaluated Ecological Impact: This study does not provide a sufficient 
evaluation of the ecological impact of spreading millions of Wolbachia-infected 
mosquitoes. This creates uncertainty about the long-term consequences of this 
large-scale intervention on the local ecosystem. 
 
• 
Uncertainty Regarding Ecosystem Risks: Potential risks to the 
ecosystem and biodiversity, both arising from the introduction of Wolbachia-infected 
mosquitoes and their impact on non-target organisms, have not been analyzed in 
detail. The lack of this assessment creates uncertainty about potential ecosystem 
impacts. 
 
• 
Need for In-Depth Risk Analysis: A more in-depth risk analysis is 
required to evaluate possible side effects on other organisms in the ecosystem. 
Comprehensive ecological studies can provide a better understanding of the 
complexity of Wolbachia's impact on ecosystem balance. 
 
• 
Sustainability and Ecological Monitoring: The lack of emphasis on 
sustainability and ecological monitoring indicates a deficiency in study planning. 
Ecosystem impact assessments should involve long-term monitoring to capture 
effects over a sufficiently extended period. 
 
• 
Local Ecological Knowledge Limitations: This study inadequately 
considers local ecological knowledge that could enrich the understanding of the 
ecosystem where Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes are introduced. Involvement of 
local ecological experts could be an added value. 
 
7. Lack of Inclusion of Environmental Factors: 
 
• 
The study may not have comprehensively included environmental 
factors, such as housing conditions, sanitation, and human population density, which 
can affect dengue virus spread. 
 
• 
Limitations in Understanding Environmental Factors: This study does 
not provide a comprehensive overview of environmental factors that can affect 
dengue virus spread. Limited understanding of housing conditions, sanitation, and 
human population density can hinder the interpretation of research results. 
 
• 
Limitations in Explaining Ecosystem-Human Interactions: Not including 
environmental factors comprehensively can limit the study's ability to explain the 
complex interactions between the ecosystem, vector mosquitoes, and the human 
population. This can inhibit a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of 
dengue virus spread. 

 
• 
Lack of Multivariable Analysis: Limitations in including environmental 
factors also affect the study's ability to perform adequate multivariable analysis. 
More complex analyses can provide better insights into the relative contribution of 
environmental factors to dengue virus spread. 
 
• 
Need for Integration of Environmental Data: This study needs to benefit 
from the integration of more detailed environmental data, including variables such as 
housing cleanliness, sanitation patterns, and population density. Integrating this data 
can result in a deeper understanding of the environmental context. 
 
8. Lack of Community Involvement: 
 
• 
Community involvement in the planning and implementation of this 
project may not be adequately represented. Community participation should be the 
main focus to achieve sustainability. 
 
• 
Suboptimal Community Involvement: This study does not emphasize 
community involvement sufficiently in the planning and implementation of the project. 
Lack of involvement can harm the sustainability of the project and the effectiveness 
of implementation in the field. 
 
• 
Lack of Clear Community Involvement Plan: The absence of a clear 
plan on how the community is involved in the project can lead to a lack of support, 
understanding, and acceptance from involved parties. A more structured community 
involvement plan can enhance project effectiveness. 
 
• 
Perception and Community Needs Gap: Not taking into account the 
gap between community perceptions and needs with the project plan can result in an 
imbalance in implementation. Optimal community involvement should reflect local 
aspirations and needs. 
 
• 
Limitations in Addressing Local Challenges: Without involving the 
community comprehensively, the project struggles to identify and address local 
challenges that may arise during implementation. Community involvement can 
provide crucial insights into local dynamics. 
 
Recommendations: 
 
• 
Further and Longer Studies: 
 
• 
Conduct further studies with a more comprehensive design and longer 
duration to understand the long-term effectiveness and impacts of the project. 
 
• 
Ecosystem and Biodiversity Analysis: 
 
• 
Investigate the ecological impacts and potential threats to biodiversity 
alongside the spread of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes. 
 
• 
In-Depth Epidemiological Analysis: 
 
• 
Conduct a more in-depth epidemiological analysis to understand the 
relationship between mosquito infection and dengue cases in humans. 
 
• 
Expansion to Aedes albopictus: 
 
• 
Evaluate the role of Aedes albopictus as a potential vector, expanding 
the understanding of dengue spread comprehensively. 
 
• 
Comprehensive Environmental Assessment: 
 
• 
Include a more comprehensive environmental assessment, 
incorporating factors such as housing and human population density. 
 
• 
Participatory Community Planning: 
 
• 
Involve the community more actively in project planning and 
implementation, providing better education to them. 
 
• 
Health and Safety Risk Analysis: 

 
• 
Perform a comprehensive health and safety risk analysis related to 
human interaction with Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes. 
 
• 
Independent Evaluation: 
 
• 
Conduct an independent evaluation by experts not involved in the 
project to ensure the integrity and validity of the study results. 
 
6th December 2023 
Following up the intuition that the United States should use its power of VETO over 
the United Nations and stop the agenda. 
Beginning another strategy of conducting a hearing in the Planning Department 
rather than wait for a court hearing: 
 
To the Children’s Health Defense lawyers in the US. 
“Good luck fighting the proliferation of unregulated cell towers/energy weapons and 
the Bill H.R. 3557. Attached is my friend, Diarmaid Mulcahy’s presentation to the EU 
against 5G (particularly around schools) when he was nominated as an MEP a few 
years ago. 
 
On the wider power grab, I notice that the US amongst others can VETO the United 
Nations on sovereignty grounds. 
 
'In that time, only one veto has been cast with a clear reference to the permanent 
member’s own security or sovereignty.  
Instead, vetoes have mostly been cast to protect allies or to limit how much the UN 
can get involved in other states internal affairs.'  
 
 If you would like to partner with lawyer Philip Kruse who is representing 11 Members 
of the European Parliament in claiming the illegitimacy and illegality of the IHR and 
Treaty, please.get in touch with him kruse@kruse-law-ch and us in Indonesia 
blocking GM mosquitoes, experimental vaccines  and digital passports while at the 
same time finding out that indonesia submitted and welcomed most of the things 
from the United Nations/WHO, in the first place  
https://stopillegitimatevetoes.org/about-the-veto/how-is-the-veto-used/  
 
We have an upcoming opportunity to meet with Indonsia's health minister and 
maybe ambassador,  to the United Nations (based in NY) in front of the Coordination 
Committee and military, who are both on our side as they were not asked about the 
introduction of hundreds of millions of mosquitoes engineered to carry Wolbachia IP 
Technology and the biosecurity risk. After being offered this meeting, I revisited my 
legal strategy and noticed "a charge of treason or of any offence against the security 
of the state brought against ministers needs the initiative of one quarter of the 
members of the Corordination Dept and military and the approval of the majority 
thereof. I realized that this would be a day when lawyers working on this could attend 
and manage it like a court and explore the range of criminal, civil and treasonous 
charges levelled against them. If it worked, these could be applied to Health 
ministers (WHO delegates) and United Natoins representatives and the big funders 
and bodies actually, a few at a time and not only stop the UN and all the heinous 
initiatives but also claim compenation for the people in each country from the 
Pandemic Treaty. I wondered if Russia used this right to VETO yet when they 
withdrew and helped 10 others 

 
Many thanks for your interest. Recently, I served notice on the director general of the 
WHO, demanding answers to due diligence questions (inspired by my time at 
Institute For Responsible Technology) and also appealed to countries who have 
withdrawn from the WHO to help others who have or are trying to, as the retaliations 
have already started  here in Bali. I will forward those emails.  
 
Thank you for your interest,  
Kind regards,” 
 
6th December  
More on the plan for establishing Charges of Treason against the Security of the 
State 
by bringing together all Coordination ministers, including Health and Defence 
Ministers: 
I think we have the opportunity to consider charges of treason in a formal setting 
without involving a court. Have you been invited to (or even heard of) this public 
meeting being set up with the Health Minister? I think we should make sure 
Arrmanatha Nasir - Indonesia's UN ambassador. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrmanatha_Nasir is there too, and the Defense minister 
to share their understanding of the agreements they have made on behalf of 
Indonesia.  
 
It should be held by the full Coordination Committee and Military; Navy, Army, 
Airforce, and Police Generals.  
 
This is because Richard said that the Planning Minister is very keen to challenge the 
WHO and for this to happen, the Health Minister has to be charged and now we 
know that the Defense Minister must be charged as well, with at least Ministerial 
Criminal Responsibility. This was a term I explored when developing an early legal 
strategy (which I probably sent to you) For example, in the Indonesian Second Book 
of Crimes, V11 cover crimes against the safety of other persons and property. 
 
We need a bigger case that can be transferred to other countries and charges of 
treason against the security of the state need the initiative of one quarter of the 
members of the Corordination Dept and Military and the approval of the majority 
thereof. These exact people will be at the meeting.  
 
I have invited the lawyers from World Council For Health, who can be there in the 
background so it can take place mainly in Bahasa Indonesia as such a meeting 
usually would but because it is a public meeting, it will be streamed and or the full 
transcript made public.  
 
I will send you my WHO Treaty Due Diligence Questions so that they can be 
translated and used in the meeting and then also maybe the lawyers can propose 
some questions and they can be translated in readiness as well. The meeting will 
take place and then all the lawyers and other interested parties can use the 
information gathered to stop the mosquitoes and the WHO and, indeed the United 
Nations. 
 

It is this serious because I gather the Partnership between the US and UK who want 
to get a nuclear submarine for Australia (and probably require Indonesia's uranium) 
have taken an interest and offered the meeting. We need our whole people there.  
 
I also found out that China, UK, France, Russia and America can VETO the WHO 
and I think it might be the American lawyers who can bring that possibility to 
realization. 
 
8th December 2023 - I find out about the AUKUS Nuclear Submarine partnership 
and knowing what that means for Indonesia 
Coordination Committee (Bappenas) with lawyers present to hold UN and WHO 
ambassadors to account 
The following is the public meeting proposed in the confidential group which I think 
would be much better facilitated as a Coordination Committee Meeting, to formally 
invite Minister of health, Minister of Defense and Ambassador to the UN to discuss 
the WHO Treaty and the UN COP28 (link below: surveillance and climate action 
going through). Lawyers from Children's Health Defense Africa and  World Council 
for Health lawyers against the WHO have been invited to contribute and be there, in 
the foreground or background. It can be conducted on Zoom and the objective is 
specifically to gather evidence on record that shows treason against the security of 
the state. The military must be there as well, because charges of Treason must be 
agreed by a small percentage of the Coordination Committee and a small 
percentage of the military. It doesn't need to be anything like a court, just a justified 
meeting called, which those three officials know more about than the rest of the 
Coordination Committee ministers. Then the transcript is translated and made 
available to all the lawyers to use in the countries where they are representing 
ministers and others against the WHO/UN  
This was the meeting being set up in a way that sounded many alarm calls to me as 
he was so over-familiar about everyone. 
"Another important topic, I was asked in my today's meeting: Do we want to officially 
challenge the Ministry of Health in a discussion. 
"Believe it or not, we can possibly setup a public Meeting with the MoH to answer 
our questions. Do we want that? Yes/No ?”   
Blessed morning everyone, currently discussing the scope/goals of the meeting 
(local, national, international …), list of participants and who is inviting whom. Stay 
tuned! 
I asked: Thanks, are you working with Deva to set up the meeting? 
"No" 
A few messages later in conversation with Michael: 
"For the moment, I can only say, that we made a lot noise, and that this meeting will 
be now ordered top down. The meeting with StC etc. was bottom up on a local level. 
Now it became a matter of national security. Let's see ..." 
The aim is now, to send a strong message to the world that Bali will be safe and 
WMP will be expelled from the island. This will weaken the propaganda by the 
Australian Tourism Ministry, which always aims to stop Aussies from coming to Bali. 
A mosquito plague would achieve exactly this and is for sure part of their Agenda! 
That was also part of the discussion yesterday. Good luck with getting a neutral 
article out into the Australian news! I never saw one until today. 
Since the last AUSMIN meeting in July, where AUKUS members strengthened their 
military ties to counter superpower China, I have become more confident that we will 

publish a positive article there and not in Australia. It's ridiculous." 
 
I have no idea what this conversation above means but I looked up AUKUS and just 
noticed that in my screenshot it had above it that “Arkus members must maintain 
warm ties with Indonesia regardless of who wins the Presidential election!” 
 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AUKUS - partnership between UK, US to help Australia 
get nuclear submarines. 
 
This is the treason, to commit Indonesia to a treaty that will mean it is forced to 
exploit its resources at its own expense to provide fuel and weapons for Australia's 
nuclear submarines - that sail 365 a year regardless of war or peace as its too 
dangerous to turn them on or off. They want Indonesia's resources and force their 
extraction on climate action grounds. Hence all the military involvement but token 
characters, not the senior officials who actually care or understand biosafety and 
protecting Indonesia from misuse. 
 
This is the plan that Biden made with the president: The Semi-conductor eco system!

Court can only intervene where a State is unable or unwilling to genuinely carry out 
the investigation and prosecute the perpetrators.

through a change to the Rome Statute, to make defining oneself as a biological man

18th December 2023 - Attempts to Stop Elon Musk’s 180 day permit. 
Richard C Cook, Treasurer who intends to end usury was, before that, the whistle 
blower on the Challenger Disaster in 1985, which meant that nuclear weapons were 
not put in space. I asked him if he would again try and block the weaponisation of 
space, this time by Elon Musk in his Star Link project.  
“I was wondering if you have the energy for another whistle blowing case. Elon Musk 
has just been given a 180 day permit to radiate us with his 5G but it coincides with 
his data collection mission for his DOJO AI project. SImultaneously, the founder of 
the WEF's son wants to expel the WEF from Geneva so that they can't all enjoy 
diplomatic immunity and keep funding the biotech that he and his Mum are dying 
from. We have offered to heal him so that he can see his vision come true. I would 
like for us all to set up a bank so when the UN and the WEF and friends/funders do 
come to account, that money can be shared between everyone. The Arkus 
partnership is a deal betweeen US UK and Australia where the first two will buy 
Australia 8 nuclear submarines. The UN will then insist Indonesia exploits its nuclear 
resources to arm and run it. they will say they need the resources on clean energy !! 
‘Climate action’ grounds. It is deep stuff but I need  you to help me put together a 
case against the WEF and the weaponization of space again. thanks so much, 
Frances 
 
18th December to Professor Richard Claproth, on the assembling of Public Banks 
I would like your help in setting up public banks so that when we seize the assets of 
Elon Musk, Gates and that Pandemic Fund, we can distribute it safely. The team are 
all healers and include you, me, Dr Kun (on AI), Richard C Cooke (US Usury expert) 
Diarmaid Mulcahy (Public Banking and stop 5G MEP candidate (I sent you his 5G 
presentation), the WEF member, the MEP (Pierre Larrouturou) who went on hunger 
strike for 30 days to try and persuade the rest of the European economic 
commission to get financial institutions to agree to pay a 0.01% tax during the 

pandemic as they were making so much money on making everyone use their cards, 
rather than cash. These are the only responsible adults I can think of so far that 
should be in charge of money when this is all over! It has been upsetting me since I 
heard that Indonesian's make an average of 3000 dollars a year and Australians 
make an average of 45,000 dollars! 
  
The following are papers that were sent privately to me but I've decided you are my 
main hope of ever bringing banks like this to realization, for the Indonesian provinces 
and all the other UN member states.  I will forward the other link Harald Felzen 
(Head of the International Cooperative Arm of the big German Sparkassen Bank) 
sent to me so that between us all we can communicate and hatch a plan so we are 
ready to level the playing field and protect Bali's waterways and Ireland's and 
everyone else's ecology and food security too, by starting public banks with a golden 
peg of water and subsistence farm land. 
 
Harald's email is below. I will send the other names and contact details. 
 
I am going to say we will help this man and his Mum heal (he describes himself and 
her as ‘dying from their vaccine injuries’). He is the son of the founder of the WEF 
and wants to expel the WEF and the WHO/UN from Geneva so they can face arrest.  
He has filed criminal charges on the Swiss Prime Minister to expel them. Jane 
informed me that Donald Trump put legislation in place for seizing assets of people 
who try and swing elections, so we can use this instrument to sue the funders and 
authorities who are seeking election through this WHO/UN power grab. 
 
Firstly, we need to demand that the FCC  (the US technology certification authority) 
withdraw Elon Musk's 180 day experimental permit to radiate us all and collect huge 
amounts of data for his DOJO AI  computer project - He and T Mobile - the devices 
producer he is partnering with, have over a billion dollars paid already in lawsuits for 
their legal and compliance violations.  
 
If we write something about it, we can give it to the Congressmen who are listening 
to us already - Dan Fernandez and his team. Congress is over the FCC in authority!!

Subject: Can You Stop the Spread of Wolbachia Mosquitoes? 
 
Happy 75th National Defense Day! 
Yours faithfully, 
We invite the respected Chairperson of the DPR-RI to take the time to carefully 

evaluate all aspects related to the Wolbachia Mosquito Spreading program. 
Together with this email, we present information as a reference for knowledge about 
the Wolbachia Mosquito and its technological developments which can be mastered 
just by studying each link that we include. 
We want to ensure that the policies taken are in the interests of society as a whole. 
Nation's Gladiator Petition 
More than 5000 Indonesians signed the petition stating that they want a due 
diligence process to be carried out. 
In this Petition, quite comprehensive information is provided as a reference for 
knowledge about the Wolbachia Mosquito and biotechnology which is commonly 
used by foreign militaries by utilizing nanotechnology. 
Nanotechnology 
We hope that this email can provide complete and clear information so that you, as 
Chair of the Indonesian People's Representative Council, will have enough 
references to make the best decisions for the Indonesian 
nation. 
 
The Mangkus said it is not an appropriate and respectful response to any 
health or environmental problem. Jro Mangku Gusti made a 
statement rejecting the Wolbachia Mosquito-spreading program and all GMOs 
applied to any health action strategies and WHO scenarios. 
He said “Bali is the island of the Gods, not a place to play God” 
 
The government's program to tackle Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) by breeding 
hundreds of millions of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes has become a controversial topic 
and has reaped pros and cons in society. WMP (World Mosquito Program) requires 
90% approval from the community before they can carry out the distribution of 
Wolbachia mosquito eggs, which they did not get in Indonesia. 
The reason there has been resistance to the program recently is 
because they did not ask for approval from the community. Only on September 15 
2023, they made an announcement via an Instagram post: 
https://www.instagram.com/p/CxNITlcr9py/ 
Denpasar Mayor I Gusti Ngurah Jaya Negara stated that the Denpasar Bali City 
Government plans to carry out mass distribution of Aides aegypti mosquito eggs 
exposed to Wolbachia bacteria as an effort to optimize prevention of the 
spread of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) starting on the 13th November 2023 
It is not a coincidence that the Mayor referred to dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), 
which is a more serious and rare type of dengue fever. When 
dengue fever is common, the same parties - Bill Gates, Minister for health, WHO and 
pharmaceutical industry manufacturers would then prescribe the use of an 
experimental vaccine funded by the same people. 
An example is the incident in Kalimantan, where mosquitoes were distributed and 
then dengue fever vaccines to children. At the same time, Gates and the WHO say 
there is no successful vaccine for Dengue yet. 
INFORMATION ON THE RELEASE OF 200 MILLION MOSQUITOES IN BALI 
 
Evolutionary pressure after the release of Wolbachia mosquito eggs can make the 
DB virus more virulent. This principle states that in environments with selection 
pressures, species tend to evolve to develop characteristics that make them more 
resistant or hardy to those pressures. 

Evolutionary Pressure in the Context of the Wolbachia Mosquito: By introducing the 
Wolbachia Mosquito into the Aides aegypti 
mosquito population, a new environment is created that allows for evolutionary 
pressure, which can 
lead to more serious types of DB such as dengue hemorrhagic fever. This is 
because the DB virus and other pathogens will adapt to survive. 
Wolbachia works by infecting and altering the reproductive and immune systems of 
mosquitoes. The mosquitoes 
and diseases that do survive will likely have a selective advantage and make them 
endemic where they were not before. 
Zika was considered a harmless disease until a mass release of mosquitoes was 
carried out in Brazil. 
Link to Frances’ white paper: “Mosquitoes From a Microbial Perspective” 
 
The resource person present was Frances Micklem, who was involved in 
researching, writing and editing the white paper for the Institute for Responsible 
Technology. Their focus is on raising awareness about the dangers of microbial 
gene editing because unlike chemical contamination, microbes spread and mutate. 
This technology is now widely used by society and is planned by WHO and the UN 
for use in the pharmaceutical industry, green technology, pesticides, agriculture, food 
industry and national security.

The first urgent Zoom meeting called by Professor Richard Claproth was also 
attended by Prof. Adi Utarini and Pak Warsito as Wolbachia researchers from UGM, 
and Tjok Gde Kerthyasa, a practitioner who specializes in hemopathy and has 
studied the problem of dengue fever. 
Apart from the speakers, the Zoom Meeting included participants from the Ministry of 
Health, BAPPENAS and other 
government institutions. 
Many foreigners who have lived in Bali for a long time 
attended because of their concerns about the program to 
spread mosquito eggs infected with Wolbachia which is scheduled to be distributed 
on November 13, 2023.

evidence has been unlawfully deleted.  
 
In relation to the Cartagena Protocol and Protocol Nagoya, Wolbachia Mosquito 
distribution program raises concerns; 
1 Wolbachia is IP Protected whose intellectual property rights are patented and 
enjoy local environmental protection and 
doctors will not be allowed to test the effects of these mosquitoes. 
2 Mosquito eggs are exempt from import and export regulations so they can pass 
without any security inspection. 
3 mosquito species are being used and utilized in military technology, to expand 
surveillance capacity. 
4 Security testing is carried out with the Microsoft AI program. 5 No field trials have 
been conducted 
previously for gene drives because they cannot be returned to their 
original state.  

6 The Wolbachia Mosquito Program lacks coordination 
with departments related to national interests. 
7 There is no person responsible if there is an impact or 
negative outcome of the program. The Implementers, scientists and MoH deny 
liability. 
8 Ethical principles such as permission from the community 
Prior to this, information must be provided explaining the advantages and 
disadvantages, benefits and dangers, weaknesses and 
shortcomings of the Wolbachia Mosquito distribution program. There has been no 
informed consent. 
9 Research into the environmental impact of trials in Jogjakarta was not measured. 
10 Social awareness of the program is very minimal. 
11 The economic impact of fewer tourists and foreign workers is not considered. 
12 Consultation and coordination with the Ministry 
Defense and Security and the Ministry of Environment and Forestry, even with 
BAPPENAS, have not taken place, even though this mosquito program is mass- 
producing biological agents to be released in Indonesia which will have a wide 
impact and have the potential to be detrimental and even dangerous, intentionally or 
unintentionally. 
13 Security is covered by an American agency, namely DARPA, which is 
recommended by WHO, and has a diplomatic immunity in Geneva, which is funded 
privately by a family in Australia. 
14 Worst of all, we discovered that Wolbachia mosquitoes contain Internet Protocol 
Technology, which the health minister knew about, from information disclosed by 
program researchers.

15 Risk of moderate endemic and early childhood. Short, medium and long term 
risks 
of the Wolbachia Mosquito egg dispersal program are unpredictable. 
Fortunately, on November 5 2023, the Acting Governor of Bali sent representatives 
from the Bali Health Service to meet with Gladiator Nation, the Bali community and 
Bali Solidarity at the "Car Free Day" event in front of the Bajra Sandhi Monument to 
inform them that there would be coordination 
with the Bali Health Office regarding the program release of Wolbachia mosquitoes. 
And it would be postponed. 
We were invited to an emergency meeting regarding the mosquito program in the 
coming days. I sent an email to all the attendees representing several stakeholders 
so they were informed and aware of our concerns. 
The following is a list of stakeholders listed in the meeting invitation regarding the 
mosquito program planned for Bali. 
During this meeting, it was revealed that the mass release of Wolbachia mosquitoes 
in Bali (Denpasar and Buleleng) was not a program from 
the central government, but rather a program implemented by Save the Children and 
WMP (World Mosquito Program) without a formal legal basis with the 
Bali government. It was also revealed that stakeholders had received money in 
exchange for allowing the release of mosquitoes. 
You might be interested to know whether the same stakeholders are informed in 
other cities as well? 
Bali is lucky to know that the implementation of the Wolbachia Mosquito program is 
illegal so it can be stopped, while other cities should still be 

able to stop the program even though it is a program from the central government. 
 
Is the same information also given in other cities? 
Has it been shared that there are now questions about safety or efficacy, and there 
are now criminal investigations into the implementers, WMP and Save the Children? 
Professor Richard Claproth, accompanied by Dewa Putu 
Sudarsana, submitted a report about illegal activities and spreading fake news 
carried out by WMP and Save The Children to the Police Station in Bali. 
The health and monitoring programs implemented by the Minister of Health are 
based on WHO instructions, without coordinating with the Ministry of 
Defense and Security and the Ministry of Environment and Forestry and without 
coordinating with BAPPENAS. 
Link to Law 32 of 2009 (PPLH) 
Furthermore, WMP avoids all important questions regarding the spread of Wolbachia 
bacteria (Gene Drive) with the claim that laboratory-created mosquitoes are 
completely natural - False. 
Gene Drive is a technology; Wolbachia IP is a technology; and the final 
microinjection of the new gene sequence also involves genetic engineering 
technology. This made us realize that weak technologies are being used and justified 
for these high-impact projects, just as pharmaceutical companies are calling gene 
edited  therapies “vaccines”. 
Still part of the police investigation, WMP scientists met with Professor Richard 
Claproth. 
Graphs from the scientists show a large unexplained increase in the Culex mosquito 
species, which carries Japanese Encephalitis (JE) in Kulon Progo 
- Yogyakarta, where there have never been cases of JE before. 
 
Richard notes his other concerning findings here: But this evidence has been 
intentionally destroyed by the Indonesian Authorities too. 
There are claims that Wolbachia mosquitoes can reduce the spread of dengue fever 
by 70-90%, however testing methods are very limited 
and rely on people being able to attend express clinics and reliance on the dubious 
use of PCR tests. 
In addition, there is no socialization or even transparency regarding the need for this 
potentially detrimental new law. 
WMP did not provide an explanation for the situation in Sri Lanka, after mass 
releases there, where there is still a spike 
in dengue fever outbreaks. With 64,109 cases since January 2023, eight high-risk 
districts recorded 23,222 cases till May. Similar to the 2017 outbreak, immediate 
action is needed. WHO reported 62,783 cases as of September 8. 
See: Sri Lanka: Dengue Outbreak - May 2023 
Singapore, which has implemented the Wolbachia Mosquito program 
since 2016, is still experiencing a fourfold increase in dengue fever cases. 
Maybe you will be surprised to learn that there are irregularities because the 
Wolbachia Mosquito program has been included in the Decree of the Minister of 
Health No. 1341 of 2022 concerning the Implementation of a Dengue Control Pilot 
Project through Wolbachia as an innovation for controlling DHF 
which will be implemented in 5 cities, namely Semarang, West Jakarta, Bandung, 
Kupang and Bontang.

This was made without any regulatory basis. But later on, Minister of Health 
Regulation Number 2 of 2023 was issued. 
Link to Minister of Health Regulation Number 2 of 2023 
The Acting Governor of Bali wrote this letter after we reported to the Police Station 
stating that mosquito releases must be stopped until Due Diligence is 
carried out, and the President of Indonesia supports his decision. 
The PJ Governor thanked the Gladiator Nation, Bali Solidarity, Aspect, and SIS 
communities for notifying them of this grave danger in a timely manner. 
Furthermore, an online petition was created against the spread of the Wolbachia 
mosquito by the SFS Foundation, ASPEK Indonesia and Gladiator Nation.

Which received support from the foreign community who care about Bali and they 
also created an online petition in English.

• The release of Wolbachia mosquitoes, as biological agents, must be approached 
with caution and careful consideration. Articles 399 and 445 of the new Health Law 
(UU 17/2023) classify the release of biological agents that have the potential to 
cause disease as a criminal 
offence, underscoring the need for research and transparency before implementation 
• Because the Wolbachia Mosquito release program is based on the instructions of 
the Minister of Health, in our opinion, it is best to 
report and investigate the Minister by the Police. In the police investigation process, 
all data and facts will be revealed, and it can be determined whether the Minister has 
committed a violation of the law. 
• If the Minister of Health cannot provide evidence that all risks mentioned in this 
article have been fully researched, addressed and ruled out, then the provisions of 
"potentially causing an outbreak" in the criminal article are fulfilled. Everyone has the 
right to file a criminal complaint with the police, and this may contain sufficient 
evidence to support the filing of the report. 
• Article 399: "Everyone is prohibited from: 
a. distributing materials that contain causes of disease and health problems that 
have the potential to cause outbreaks; and/or 
b. spread disease-causing biological agents that have the potential to cause 
outbreaks and epidemics." 
• Article 445: "Any person who carries out activities that distribute materials that 
contain disease-causing and/or biological agents 
that cause disease and health problems that have the potential to cause outbreaks 
and epidemics as intended in Article 399 may be sentenced to imprisonment for a 
maximum of 12 (twelve) years or a maximum fine of IDR 5,000,000,000 (five billion 
rupiah)."

parallel, in an effort to stop the spread of Wolbachia mosquitoes, namely by 
submitting a SOMASI demanding that the Minister of Health immediately 
revoke the Decree of the Minister of Health Number HK.01.07/MENKES/ 1341/2022 
and stop all actions to spread the biological agent that causes disease and that can 
cause disease. 
Potential to cause outbreaks and epidemics, especially mosquitoes modified with 
Wolbachia bacteria and other modified or engineered living organisms. 
Link to Minister of Health's summons 
In conclusion, we strongly disagree with the method and approach for the mass 
release of Wolbachia Mosquitoes. 
The denial by the Minister of Health, the World Mosquito Program, and 
the World Health Organization of the Wolbachia IP artificial intelligence technology 
and the genetic engineering associated with it shows a lack 
of interest in human life and even indicates an unsavoury and unannounced hidden 
purpose for its inclusion. 
We also firmly believe that this program is a waste of money and could provide a 
much better alternative approach. 
It will be realized that mosquitoes were the first of the UN and WHO's unplanned, 
unsafe and health measures that Indonesia could not refuse. 
Bandung became the first city of the 5 cities designated for the trial so it refuses to 
be used as a trial city for the spread of the Wolbachia Mosquito. 
 
We apologize for including so many scientific terms in this information, but my 
knowledge of this is the only way to protect Indonesia from the silent infiltration of the 
use of this experimental technology. We would also like to remind you of the risk of 
new international legislation that may require Indonesia to exploit its nickel resources 
for electric vehicle batteries in allegedly ‘environmentally friendly’ technologies and 
exploit Indonesia’s nuclear resources 
to power and arm submarines for the Arkus partnership 
We have high hopes for this request to stop the program to spread Wolbachia 
mosquito eggs. 
For the consideration and wisdom of the Honorable Madam Chair of the House of 
Representatives of the Republic of Indonesia, we express our gratitude. 
Warm regards, 
Micklem, Frances

Invited the public banking experts to an initial meeting but just a few turned out for 
the zoom 
 
January 1st 2024 
Economic Injustice: We are Heading into the Same Storm but We are not all in the 
Same Boat. 

Article to raise awareness for Indonesian authorities and sent to all Kodim and all 
parliamentarians. 
 
Indonesia is one ‘member state’ of the United Nations. There are more than 190 
other countries. Indonesian men and women have incomes equivalent to between 
3,000 and 9,000 US dollars a year. Australians receive about $45,000. The US 
average is more like $75,000 and the average UK citizen earns the equivalent of 
$40,000. However, the majority of people in every country have very little at all. Like 
many in Indonesia, people everywhere are living in extreme poverty and only just 
surviving. Let’s consider these few countries though because we already share goals 
and partnerships, and soon - in April 2024 - we will share the same budget: A 
Pandemic Preparedness Fund. Readers might hope that this money has been 
collected to share out between people, to buy what they need, if there’s another 
lockdown, but this is not the plan. There is a big chance that the money has all been 
delegated for smart technologies. 
This means that the candidates competing for a place in government face a heroic 
task of constant research into new innovations. Most genetic engineering and 
artificial intelligence are completely beyond human understanding, assessment and 
control. Nonetheless, here in early 2024, cautious decisions must be made and 
experimental permits must be refused, when the proposed research is likely to cause 
more problems than it solves. One risk is that the introduction of many new 
technologies will degrade health when they interact, like chemicals that only become 
explosive or toxic when they are mixed. 
 
The President has done his best to protect Indonesia from falling into great debt by 
not being persuaded to mine the seabed for precious marine resources, in the past. 
This year, however, the Nation might be put under new pressure to do so. In the 
upcoming election debates, it will be a chance to hear what the government intends 
to do to resist these man-made threats; economic, biological, digital, electro 
magnetic and environmental. The continued pressure to accept massive releases of 
mosquitoes, must surely be on the agenda for the discussion. Also the question of 
whether a foreign agency can really improve the Economy and quality of life for 
Indonesians. It would be unifying for the people to hear the vision that elected 
candidates have of what they would do, if Indonesia could get out from its alleged 
debt and keep control of the budget? 
 
But there is no threat of a pandemic is there? What is so different about this year? 
Well, actually, it is not the government who will be in charge. It is the World Health 
Organization, one of the United Nations’ departments. They are based in 
Switzerland, where they have a system called “diplomatic immunity”. This means 
that, even if the World Health Organization recommends a vaccine that causes harm 
and even death, or the World Economic Forum requires Indonesia’s nuclear 
resources as repayment of a national debt and that causes economic and 
environmental collapse, no-one is accountable or financially liable. One light on the 
horizon is that there is the beginning of a movement calling for these influential 
global leaders to relinquish their diplomatic immunity so they can take responsibility 
for the outcomes of their decisions. 
  
Let us ask the election candidates to address this real life situation as a case study: 
The lead scientist of the World Health Organization, Jeremy Farrar has just, in 

December 2023, forecast the next pandemic...”Prepare bird flu vaccines now before 
virus jumps to humans, top scientist warns”. But back in 2008 he had already 
designed a vaccine ”In the last few years, Farrar has focused on the pathophysiology 
and treatment of avian influenza. He is also exploring the cross-reactivity of memory 
T cell responses to influenza in hopes of creating a broadly protective vaccine for 
H5N1". He was also involved in the Gain of Function research that made the bird flu 
transmissible to mammals (and therefore humans) in 2015. The questions for debate 
are, can Indonesia’s Coordination Committee keep up with this high impact project 
and provide regulation? Can they even answer what is “pathophysiology”, or “the 
cross-reactivity T cell responses”, or a “broadly protective vaccine”? Or, instead, will 
ministers allow an unelected group, the WHO, with longterm financial vested 
interests and valuable patents, dictate Indonesia’s financing of research, purchase 
and then mandating of experimental vaccines to all ages, even children, regardless 
of efficacy or safety? Should Indonesia even accept communications and 
surveillance equipment, that is protected by patents held in other countries? Who will 
have access to personal data collected and national defence information? 
 
It has not reassured doctors investigating the WHO-approved mosquito releases that 
the same scientist conducted some of the first research into using GMO mosquitoes 
to address mosquito-born diseases, funded the genetically modified mosquitoes of 
Oxitec and taught many of the World Mosquito Program team. Many of you will be 
following the large question mark over the continued mass release of Aedes Aegypti, 
even after soaring Dengue cases, spikes in the Culex species and associated 
Japanese Encephalitis cases, after previous releases. 
 
Hopefully parliamentarians are investigating the exposure of the fact that foreign-
owned Internet Protocol Technology is in the Wolbachia bacteria, used to infect the 
mosquitoes, without any public explanation of what the Artificial Intelligence 
technology will be used for. Unfortunately we know they are not investigating the 
deployment of mosquito eggs, as their official email addresses remain unopened. In 
parallel, more than twenty countries have notified the World Health Organization that 
they are withdrawing from the Pandemic Treaty and thousands of notices have been 
sent to the WHO from groups of lawyers, doctors, and individual men and women. 
These have been ignored as well. With no formal acknowledgement, publication or 
detailed consideration by Indonesia’s full Coordination Committee, decision-making 
power could pass to the WHO as soon as the 27th January, when the silent deadline 
for rejecting 300 further amendments to the International health Regulations goes 
past. 
All regulatory authorities must pay continual attention to national and international 
news and be ready to show daring and courage in making decisions that will benefit 
the people. 
  
At Gladiator Bangsa, we are very wary of reducing one recordable problem, for 
example Dengue, by causing an infinite number of others that are less easy to 
identify. Therefore our commitment to you is to write every day, to illuminate the 
nature of the science and the risks of the biobanks planned - full of blood and 
pathogen samples, which we fought hard not to share in the past. 
 
We will explore how the WHO, UN, Sustainability Goals department and WEF new 
legal instruments could impact the day to day life, bodily integrity, privacy, freedom 

and safety. For example how the use of nuclear power is ‘maximised’ by the UN and 
their intention to use armed nuclear submarines in the pandemic response supply 
chain. On the brighter side, we will also explain the power of our sovereignty as a 
nation and as men and women. By using the art of our inner intention, decision-
making and vision it translates inter outer transformation. We hope to inspire 
independent thought and maybe even achieve personal and a sort of collective ‘mind 
control’ that can overcome the technological and esoteric mind control that has been 
used to dupe us. 
 
We have a moment of choice and we want to know the elected candidates realise 
what is at stake. If you also want any of these questions asked or answered, please 
feel free to write it as a comment on the petition. 
 
January 5th 2024 - Email to Factor GMO, and Pascal Naiad 
Dear Ivan and Nadya, I am very keen to contact Pascal Najadi, and invite him to a 
meeting in the next few days. Would you be able to forward this to him and also 
assess if we could support your Factor GMO project? 
I read that Pascal Najadi has advised international governments. We would like to 
support Pascal Najadi as well, in his action to 1) ensure the arrest of the WEF, 2) 
widen the international pressure to stop the diplomatic immunity of the WHO and 3)  
help us in Indonesia, to structure the public banks, into which indebted member 
states can deposit and distribute their compensation, when the time comes. 
 
Gladiator Bangsa conduct their meetings in English and hope very much to welcome 
you, as well as some others who have other parts of the expertise, to envision a 
good outcome, if the WEF and other protected organizations are finally held to 
account.  
 
We have invited Harald Felzen of Sparkasse Public Bank's International 
Coorperation arm, Richard C Cook, who is a major champion for the end of Usury in 
the States as well as being the man who presented evidence that blocked the 
weaponization of space in the past; Pierre Larrouturou, the MEP who went on 
hunger strike during the plandemic to insist that financial institutions pay even 0.01% 
tax on transactions as all small businesses were being forced to invest in credit card 
machines to operate at all; and also Diarmaid Mulcahy chairman of MABs, money 
advice for men and women in personal debt, in the West of Ireland, who is another 
proponent of public banking and also EU candidate calling for a moratorium on 5G, 
on account of childhood cancers and other repercussions. Everyone in this group 
has additional extensive experience in healing and would like to extend an offer to 
both you and your family to address damage done by the GMO jabs. 
 
The leader of the Indonesian movement is Siti Fadilah, ex health minister who was 
criminalized because she stood up to the WHO for taking blood and pathogen 
samples out of Indonesia, against her ministerial ruling. Professor Richard Claproth 
has senior management experience in banking and is still involved in government, in 
the National Planning department.  
 
I believe we have to tackle the alleged debts to the International Monetary Fund and 
other banking bodies, to help Indonesia, and then other UN member states, extricate 
themselves from the WHO Treaty. It will be possible to argue the invalidity and 

bioweapons aspects. The Treaty expects a great financial commitment and a 
commitment of member states' other resources. Once we have thought of a new 
financial trajectory to actually incentivize local self sufficiency and environmental 
protection, we have the willing support of two groups of lawyers and the World 
Council For Health in building the cases.  
 
A wide range of GMO introductions are being made in Indonesia, from child 
'vaccines', to food and surveillance and they must be stopped. Initially, however, 
Gladiator Bangsa would also welcome the opportunity to contribute to Factor GMO 
with our research to stop the mass mosquito releases, classified as pesticides, 
defended as 'natural' while containing Wolbachia IP Technology. It was encouraging 
to hear how Pascal Najadi filed charges to achieve the objective of insisting the WEF 
are expelled from Switzerland and held to account. Gladiator Bangsa also filed police 
charges, first against the World Mosquito Program and Save The Children Fund, and 
then a petition against the Health Minister. We believe there are parallels in each 
country of apparently not for profit groups implementing dangerous technologies on 
experimental permits.      
 
I served notice on the WHO before the 1st December 2023 deadline to reject the 
IHR, demanding due diligence in regard to their Gain Of Function and gene drive 
creation of Potential Pandemic Pathogens. Then I put the WHO on notice again for 
retaliating when Bali managed to get a postponement of the GM mosquitoes, that 
are being released. There is a great wave of resistance from many countries but 
countries that have withdrawn, rejected or expressed reservations about the 
Pandemic and SDG declarations have yet to be acknowledged at all by the WHO. 
 
Please let me know if you are able to forward this mesage to Pascal Najadi. Wishing 
you the best of luck with your campaign too. 
                                                                                    Most gratefully,

Nuclear Submarines manned and armed with AI, Why This Mustn’t Be Allowed. 
Article to raise awareness for Indonesian authorities and sent to all Kodim and all 
parliamentarians. 
 
“Unrecoverable Error” 
It’s hard to remember what the public used to to be told about nuclear power. We 
knew nuclear reactors were dangerous because the processes of fission and fusion 
require extreme compression and extreme heat; temperatures twice as hot as the 
core of the sun. Sometimes nuclear power stations would “melt-down”, releasing 
radioactive waste. We were told that nuclear waste never degrades. Hundreds of 
millions of cubic metres, of the toxic waste, sit in each country, including Indonesia, 
while ways to store it ‘for longer than expected’ are explored. Sometimes nuclear 
waste was piped to other countries, or dumped little-by-little into the sea. More 
recently, the nuclear industry were in negotiations with gas and oil companies to bury 
the waste in empty wells. In the past, most men and women associated nuclear 
power with war and inevitable mass destruction, by accident or by design. 
 
Then there was the danger of “a maniac” “pressing the button”, detonating a nuclear 

bomb. We hoped leaders would know of the “nuclear winter” that would follow, where 
nothing will grow and so much radiation in the air would make our hair fall out, and 
quickly humans, along with the other animal and plant life would wither and die. 
 
People imagined that military personnel would wait nervously for the leader of their 
country to give the command to fire. We hoped the threat of nuclear war would only 
ever escalate following many months and years of peace negotiations, and efforts to 
find other resolutions. If we had thought about using nuclear weapons logically, we 
would have remembered that there is only ever a “4-minute warning”. Four minutes 
is not enough time to ring the President, or even discuss with a colleague, so 
whoever is on duty must rely on the notification from that computer system and 
follow protocol. Military protocol requires immediate retaliation. 
This procedure, upon which the safety of the whole world rests, was eventually 
tested: A transmission came in, to an Early Warning data centre, that the US had 
launched six nuclear missiles on Russia. By great chance, a man by the name of 
Stanislav Petrov was on duty. Feeling the responsibility for the action he had to take, 
he recognised he still had a choice. “An erroneous retaliatory nuclear attack on the 
United States and its NATO allies could have wiped out half of the population”. But 
what else did he have, in addition to the computer reports and protocol? He had the 
depth of his experience; his reasoning; his observations of the political landscape; 
his care for life and trust in his own inner authority. Petrov made “a judgement call” 
and decided the reports must be a false alarm. “An investigation later confirmed that 
the satellite warning system had indeed malfunctioned”. 
 
In the upcoming election debate, candidates should discuss their understanding and 
stance on commercial and military nuclear power and how they will lead with 
discernment and concern for the cost to life. The cost to life is not just if there’s a war 
or disaster. The replacement Trident nuclear submarine for the UK cost the same as 
providing an upgraded National Health Service for free, for the whole population, for 
45 years. Somehow the decision to finance the submarine instead of the National 
Health Service, got passed in their parliament. 
 
Thankfully, President Joko Widodo already sent a clear message to the world that 
“the possession and use of nuclear weapons cannot be justified for any reason”, 
when he ratified the Treaty Prohibiting Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) in November 
2023. But was Indonesia informed by its “Plenipotentiary ambassadors” abroad 
(These are delegates to foreign countries who have independent, executive powers 
to act on behalf of Indonesia) about the Arkus Partnership between the UK, US and 
Australia; to arm Australia with eight nuclear submarines? China have called the plan 
“a return to a Cold War mentality”. France are calling it a “stab in the back”, as a 
French company was going to manufacture the submarines and Australia had to pay 
France 555 million euro compensation, just to get out of the deal. With that level of 
international bad feeling about the Arkus partnership, only formed in 2021, ministerial 
candidates must ask whether the submarines could make Indonesia more of a 
military target, than act as a ‘deterrent’ - which is what some governments are calling 
nuclear weapons now - and the UN say nuclear submarines are great to serve on 
the Pandemic Preparedness fast-response supply chain to international health and 
security crises, where the UN say they would like to maximise the use of nuclear 
submarines. Sadly now the president is no long the president and the WHO’s military 
connection is in charge. Furthermore, we were not able to get either nuclear power 

or the mass mosquito releases on to the election agenda for debate.  
 
Following recent agreements with the US and the upcoming WHO Pandemic Treaty, 
already signed, can Indonesia put the brakes on and say ‘No’ to nuclear weapons in 
Indonesian waters or the use of Indonesian resources to fuel and arm them? The 
submarines, like the other smart technologies, are to use artificial intelligence 
extensively in their operation. 
 
Gladiator Bangsa have also been considering, when did competent authorities, 
regulators and decision-makers start trusting technology and being “digitally-
assisted”, more than trusting our own experience and knowledge and trusting each 
other? 
 
 Most people have sat in front of a computer screen for a lot longer than four 
minutes, in frustration and powerlessness, unable to even verify their own identity to 
access their own accounts. In the past, a computer screen would often read 
‘Unrecoverable Error”. Imagine the artificial intelligence in these nuclear submarines, 
executing their programmed protocols without hesitation, while the Naval 
Commander frantically tries to get clearance to stop the ballistic missiles being fired. 
The computer may require a retina scan; facial recognition; a finger print, and maybe 
an OTP - a One Time Password. Picture all these being asked for at once in order to 
return the computer system to manual controls. Too late. “Unrecoverable error”.

10th January 2024 
Reservations are Forbidden by the WHO but it is important for sovereign nations to 
be able to make ‘Reservations’  to proposed agreements.  

Important Dates 
27th January 300 more IHR Amendments go through unless we reject them. 
Working Group process finishes and sticking point on samples and pathogens is 
obviously Siti Fadilah’s expertise. First of all it is too dangerous to be allowed - 
moving man-made deadly diseases around. Secondly, if Indonesia allows that the 
sharing of the Potential Pandemic Pathogens can be voluntary, then the rich 
pharmaceutical companies will not share them and they will be the only ones that 
create vaccines that will be approved on their supply chain. If they do allow 
developing countries to have PPPs it will be an excuse to show that they need high 
security laboratories - foreign managed. And also to set up developing countries to 
‘cause’ the next pandemics by allowing the release of whatever pathogen they 
choose. To pass on the responsibility and also to justify selling the vaccines and 
developing countries owing them more money.

The World Mosquito Program claim they do not release mosquitoes unless there is 
total acceptance by the communities. But still, amid total opposition, the program 
moves inexorably forwards. 
 
In the same way, the World Health Organization and United Nations continue as if 
they have reached a consensus with member states. 
 
But there is no consensus. In fact they have received formal communications from 
delegations from 157 of the 196 UN member states at least, indicating strong 
reservations, objections, rejection of the International Health Amendments and 
withdrawal from the WHO Pandemic Treaty. In addition, groups lf doctors and 
lawyers and individuals have said no. 
“Our delegations are convinced that this is no way to handle multilateral and 
intergovernmental negotiations on issues of great relevance for the international 
community, particularly for developing countries. Thus, we would like to put on 
record that we do not condone, nor accept, this practice, and that it does not set any 
precedent for the work of the United Nations and its General Assembly.” 
 
 “Our delegations oppose any attempt to pretend to formally adopt any of the draft 
outcome documents in question, during the meetings scheduled for 18, 20, 21 and 
22 September 2023, respectively. In addition, we reserve the right to take 
appropriate action upon the formal consideration of these four (04) draft outcome 
documents in the coming weeks, after the conclusion of the High-Level Segment of 
the 78th Session of the General Assembly, when they must all be considered by the 
General Assembly in accordance with its rules of procedures.”

(All have tried to stop the treaty so we don’t have to write more times, we need to 
ask for the correspondence received by the WHO to be transparently discussed) 
‘The negative impact of unilateral coercive measures (UCMs) is an existential one for 
our peoples. A third of the world’s population is affected by these illegal measures. 
There is ample evidence, including from UN sources, of the heavy toll caused by 
UCMs on targeted countries’ capacities to achieve sustainable development and to 
make further progress in protecting the right to health of their respective populations. 
Since the beginning of these processes, we have insisted on the need to include our 
concerns in these important political documents, on the basis of consensual 
language, as reflected in paragraph 30 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable 
Development. This request has been echoed by a large number of delegations, 
including from the Group of the 77 and China, and from the Group of Friends in 
Defense of the UN Charter, among others.” 
 
“The legitimate concerns of a large number of developing countries have been 
ignored.” 

and “forcing unfair practices which pretend to impose a kind of “veto” on certain 
issues, and pretending to even prevent their discussion within the framework of 
intergovernmental negotiations.” 
 
“For example, the draft outcome of the High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable 
Development under the auspices of the General Assembly – SDGs Summit, was 
reopened with the purpose of exclusively accommodating the priorities of a few 
delegations from developed countries, while, in this very same process, and in the 
three (03) health-related negotiations, nothing was done to reflect and accommodate 
the legitimate concerns of delegations from developing countries that, in addition had 
broken silence repeatedly, including the Group of 77 and China.”

By Meryl Nass: 
Questions could profitably be asked about the following: 
 
1.  The WHO is not an honest broker.  
 
a.  Its Director-General has repeatedly lied about the WHO's 2 proposed treaties:  
the pandemic treaty/agreement, and International Health Regulation (IHR) 
amendments, claiming they do not seize sovereignty, when there is no doubt they do 
precisely that.  See Why Does the WHO Make False Claims Regarding Proposals to 
Seize States' Sovereignty? by David Bell, MD, PhD and attorney Thi Thuy Van Dinh, 
PhD. 
b.  The WHO appears to have deceived the public about whether the amendments 
"approved" in May 2022 followed the legally required procedure of a full WHA vote. 
Twelve members of the European Parliament wrote to the WHO on November 28, 
2023 asking for evidence that the WHO actually conducted a vote of the entire World 

Health Assembly to pass several new amendments in May 2022, with a 48 hour 
deadline.  The WHO did not respond, and the twelve European parliament members 
declared the May 2022 amendments null and void last week. 
c.  The WHO's principal legal office, Steven Solomon, stated in early October that 
the IHR working group did not have to follow the required procedure (found in the 
existing 2005 version of the International Health Regulations) to make public the 
draft of new proposed amendments 4 months in advance of a vote.  Thus, we may 
not see the new amendments until after the WHO members have voted on them.  
https://merylnass.substack.com/p/the-who-will-ignore-its-own-rules 
2.  The WHO's proposed treaties are unconstitutional 
 
a.  They demand that nations perform surveillance of their citizens' social media 
footprints and censor them to prevent 'infodemics' (too much information, according 
to the WHO's definition), misinformation and disinformation, surveil 
b.  They say that nations should give up the intellectual property rights of their 
citizens. 
c.  There is no due process for the declaring or ending of public health emergencies 
of international concern, for which no standards exist. 
3.  In the Oct. 30 draft of the treaty, A new WHO Secretariat and Conference of 
Parties for pandemics are to be established in the future and will make their own 
rules.  Thus, agreeing to this means providing a blank check to the WHO to do 
whatever it wants at some later date. 
 
4.  The 2 proposed treaties ignore existing internal law prohibiting the proliferation of 
biological warfare agents (the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention and the 2004 
Security Council Memorandum 1540) and demand that nations search out new 
agents (a.k.a. "potential pandemic pathogens") and share them with the WHO, which 
will "share them globally."  The WHO has already established a BioHub for this 
purpose and a Pathogen Access and Benefits System. 
 
5.  The proposed treaty and amendments also demand that nations perform 2 
additional forms of surveillance of their citizens:  microbiological surveillance of their 
populations, animals and ecosystems for pathogens, and surveillance and sharing of 
medical and hospital records, both of which violate privacy protections. 
 
6.  The proposed amendments remove the guarantee of "Human rights, dignity and 
freedom of persons" that are found in the current international health regulations. 
 
7.  The two proposed treaties are both binding, whereas the earlier IHR were 
recommendations only, apart from minor requirements for notification of certain 
outbreaks to the WHO.  The two proposed documents would give the WHO and 
particularly its Director-General vast authority to manage healthcare globally.  The 
current Director-General is not a medical practitioner and instead has a PhD in 
Community Health. 
 
8.  The WHO lacks the personnel and expertise to manage international pandemics 
and other health concerns.  Any developed nation has within it much more capacity 
to understand and manage medical events within its borders, and likely international 
events as well. 
 

9.  The proposed treaty calls for rapidly produced vaccines and for nations to 
implement domestic legislation to permit the use of unlicensed medical products 
without manufacturer liability, instead "managing" the liability issues using existing 
models, such as the US' Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program, which has 
so far compensated 8 Americans for injuries related to EUA COVID products 
(primarily vaccines) from the 12,358 claims filed.  https://www.hrsa.gov/cicp/cicp-
data 
 
Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP) Data | HRSA 
HRSA’s CICP aggregate data for countermeasure injury claims for fiscal years 2010 
– 2023. 
 
10.  It is apparent that in the process of developing the “Pandemic Accord” and 
amendments to the IHR, WHO/WHA positioned itself in a combined law-
making/executive/expert/censorship role, which is a well-known path to usurpation of 
unrestrained power. It should not be surprising, therefore, that the proposed 
Amendments grant expressly such power to the WHO. 
 
11.  The WHO receives 85% of its funding from voluntary contributions, and only 
15% from dues paid by its 194 member nations.  Most of the voluntary contributions 
are earmarked for special projects that the WHO carries out.  When President Trump 
withheld US funding in 2020, Bill Gates became the WHO's top funder.  The 
(unelected) WHO serves many private masters, yet seeks to govern the world's 
population. 
 
12.  Virtually every recommendation the WHO made for managing the COVID 
pandemic was counterproductive.  Why would we give the WHO the power to 
enforce the same bad advice on the US and world?  
 
14th January 2024 
Analysing the polio vaccine recommendations, as requested and modified insects for 
vaccine delivery  
 Thank you for your question about whether I would recommend oral vaccine, 
injected vaccine or no vaccine for polio. 
1. Choices are good! This request is really exciting to me as it means that people are 
realising that they have choices to make about their health. That is very different 
from the new policies in the pandemic, of mandatory vaccines, where everyone was 
expected to take them and not ask questions or wait until the safety tests and active 
ingredients were published. This is going to be really important again soon as the 
World Health Organization are bringing in plans for a 100-day vaccine. I believe this 
is really dangerous because, in the past, a vaccine would not be available for at least 
12 years - to make sure it worked and was safe. 
2. You asked for my professional opinion! I am honoured that you have asked me, as 
a doctor that you know and trust from my time as Health Minister. I realise that 
asking me is very different from asking your own doctor, or child’s school, or a 
hospital, or researching on line, where information may be led by medical and 
pharmaceutical industry priorities. We know that so many health funds are dedicated 
to programs for industry reasons, not because of a particular health issue. 
We have seen this with the mosquito program in Bali, where a program was paid for 
by a private Australian family, and they gave an additional 40 million dollars to 

stakeholders in Denpasar, to let them deploy the hundreds of millions of mosquito 
eggs, without informing Bapenas. 
 
There was no rise in Dengue cases (until after the mass releases), so nobody knows 
why the Indonesian cities got the mosquitoes, or why bribery was needed, instead of 
real improvements to quality of life. 
 
I assure you again that my priorities are to share everything I know and my 
experience to empower the people to make independent choices that you sense will 
be best for your children. I hope more and more people will stand up to protect their 
families from the new health laws. 
 
3. OPV: I thought I would always recommend the Oral Polio Vaccine, which was 
often delivered on a sugar-cube. It was trusted by doctors around the world for many 
decades ( even though the doctor himself who invented the vaccine expressed 
concern that the wide production and use of the vaccine was keeping the disease 
alive). But still, the Oral vaccine was again effective when Polio re-emerged again 
recently in Indonesia. I want us all to pause for a moment and please do not think it 
is natural that Polio has come back. I think it is confusing. I am very concerned about 
it and I wonder how it got here. It makes me think again about the release of the 
Aedes Aegypti mosquitoes and how this has caused a major unexpected increase in 
the Culex species of mosquito, vector of the tragic disease Japanese Encephalitis. 
Keep in mind that mosquitoes live in water for two weeks as larvae and Polio is also 
transmitted through water. 
Before it is too late, we have to wake up to the fact that laboratory-created 
mosquitoes, pharmaceutical therapies and biotech experiments must be triggering or 
transmitting any amount of diseases into our water courses and immunity responses 
in our bodies. 
 
IPV: The Inactivated polio vaccine by injection was a new creation, which I was 
asked to recommend even though it was not effective, in my experience. Shortly 
after I said I would prefer to continue recommending the oral Polio vaccine, “new 
research” came out that the Oral Polio Vaccine carried other diseases. 
Again, I ask you to pause, and realise that could be just negative information or it 
could be that the Oral vaccine does now contain or trigger new diseases. 
The health ministry has very little regulatory oversight as to what ingredients go into 
vaccines. In fact, like the mosquitoes, we now know there has been a lot of 
undeclared IP Technology coupled with CNN Artificial Intelligence put into recent 
vaccines and the Wolbachia mosquitoes. We have to stand up and ask why? 
No vaccine: Finally, there is the option of being a strict ‘vaccine safety advocate’ and 
deciding to neither give your children nor take vaccines yourself, at all. I do 
understand this choice as there has been so many adverse effects from the Covid 
vaccines and boosters and it has been so difficult to report them, get help or get 
compensation. 
   
 When I think about what a vaccine is; taking a tiny amount of a pathogen to trigger 
antibodies which build up the body’s defences, I worry that we are all taking too 
many. We already have Mumps, Measles and Rubella all taken at the same time, in 
combination; then HPV and other teenage vaccines; and now Covid boosters, 
Dengue and even a Japanese Encephalitis vaccine was nearly given to children - all 

on experimental permits. 
I think of our immune systems jumping into action, generating anti-bodies and spike 
proteins. How can putting an MMR combination injection, into an infant, not create a 
contraindication of immune responses? The combinations must be contributing to 
the rise in auto- immune diseases as our systems can no longer work out what is a 
threat and what is nourishment. 
 
The fourth option: Mosquito vaccination: This might sound extraordinary but there 
has, for many years, been a plan to use mosquitoes to inject populations of people 
who oppose vaccinations; as a way of by-passing the consent of the people; or as a 
way of not needing to even tell governments what is being administered and why like 
happened in Bali. 
 
There is a lot of talk by the WHO and the UN about mosquitoes migrating for climate 
reasons when mosquitoes can only travel substantially when their eggs are 
transported by the millions, as their eggs are viablefor over a year, where as the 
mosquitoes themselves may only live 6 weeks. Actually I believe there is so much 
damage already done to our ecosystems, and our own microbiomes, by bio-
technology, that none of the mosquito predators survive to keep the balance. 
 
4 . Even worse, the World Health Organization had already started its collection of 
Potential Pandemic Pathogens. I want you to know what these are. This means the 
diseases are more fatal and more transmissible than natural diseases. Therefore, 
what are being offered now are not really vaccines. They are gene therapies, using 
man-made diseases in laboratories as their guide. 
Some of you may remember that I tried to stop the WHO taking a dangerous 
pathogen like this out of Indonesia. I hid it safely where only one other person knew. 
But then a few years later, I checked if it was still safe and it was GONE. It was 
tracked down to the Ukraine. 
Now, here in 2024, the World Health Organization are planning BioBanks in every 
country with a selection of these man-made diseases, as if they are some sort of 
asset. They are only an asset, if you plan to lock down a nation again and sell them 
a vaccine. I really don’t want that for our people again. There was so much 
unnecessary suffering, wasn’t there.! One day there will be an apology for the long, 
hard and punishing lockdowns where there was no provision of money or food made 
for families who could not leave their houses. But today, we must stand up and say 
no to theexperimental vaccines and mosquitoes they are unleashing. And no to the 
WHO Treaty and International Health Regulations Amendments. 
 
 5. In this time when research and drug industries and so much more powerful than 
health regulatory authorities, I am cautious about making a recommendation, in case 
it is used to undermine my professional opinion. I would definitely say that there are 
pros and cons to all the choices that parents can make. I want to represent the 
people. I want to represent logic, open science and wellbeing. I want to be on the 
panel when the WHO do at last answer the Due Diligence questions we asked and, 
indeed, if the World Mosquito Program and Health Minister ever answer the Due 
Diligence questions we asked them on safety and efficacy, in comparison to the 
small trial. 
 
All I can say is let’s thank the Gods we can still choose what is right for us. This year 

there is a major threat to the health of Indonesian people. It is so hard to say No! 
already: To the mosquitoes, or question the experimental Dengue vaccines on our 
children in Kilimantan, or insist on a moratorium on Gene Drives or 5G which so 
many scientists have called for. If the Pandemic Treaty goes ahead, we will have no 
choices. 
 
6. What would be more useful in 5) We should test and filter tap water for 
Polioviruses and other water-borne diseases like Wolbachia-caused River Blindness. 
If we don’t have the sample, and we don’t test, we can’t be sure what has been 
filtered out of drinking water. 
 
However, this is different from the two new sorts of surveillance being proposed. We 
don’t want Bill Gates’ computerisation of the human body. 
Simply, filtering water or boiling water will eliminate the threat of Polio. 
 
17th January 2024 
WHO will likely impose Sanctions, for any non compliance, report as requested 
I attended the World Council For Health Activists’ meeting Friday 12th January 2024 
-  
The first lawyer to answer was a Common Law Lawyer, reminding us that 
1) Mandates are not laws. It’s a Contract Law question, where someone (President, 
Siti Fadilah or Listyo Sigit Prabowo) from Indonesia can ask, in writing, to the 
WHO,”Are you going to take liability action, if Indonesia refuses to do what the WHO 
proposes, when the action would go against Indonesia’s Constitution?” 
 
We would slightly restructure the Open Letters  Siti’ Fadilah  and Listyo Sigit 
Prabowo as ‘notices’ and send them to both the WHO and the UN. Like the Somasi, 
we would give them 10 days to reply. And, like my due diligence notice to the WHO, 
it can’t be an open letter, it has to be man-to-man, without titles. So I wrote “To 
Tedros, from Frances”. 
 
2) The first thing to find out is Did Indonesian sign the Treaty as a Nation or as a 
Corporation? 
An agreement must be between people, and therefore is not valid if it is the 
corporation. 
If it was the Corporation, it would explain why so little of the financial support for 
people in the lockdown reached the people.  
 
3) The lawyer Shabnam Mohamed at the law group then answered our question: 
what will the consequences be if we don’t do what the WHO says? 
She said the majority of lawyers believe that the UN will be used to enforce the 
WHO’s dictates with sanctions and so on. 
But this will be unlawful because it follows a UN Political Declaration in September 
that was not agreed.  
A few hours after receiving the withdrawal notice, the UN director general reported 
that the political declaration had passed through with complete consensus and did 
not mention the notification by 11 countries, withdrawing. 
This formal letter from Russia plus the 10 other countries I sent to you a few days 
ago along with an analysis. That analysis article was by this same lawyer, Shabnam 
Mohamed. 

This is the lawyer who connects the Children’s Health Defence lawyers and the 
World Council For Health lawyer. Sidnam Mohamed is from South Africa and she 
organises both the Activists  meeting and the Lawyers Against the WHO meeting.  
 
Shabnam is very keen to meet Siti Fadilah and you, and ask her to speak at an 
Experts Forum.  
I think it would be better if she would help us structure lawsuits and notices, maybe 
with Ted, pointing out the Illegality and fraud of the whole IHR, Amendments, Treaty 
and UN Treaty coming up in September. I wonder if it would be good to facilitate a 
meeting between her, us and the Working Group or the Senate leader who Siti 
Fadilah is meeting.  
 
The activist meeting focused on citizen’s initiatives, and made me think of Siti 
Fadilah’s. 
Shabnam Mohamed finally said “a citizen’s enquiry is crucial and a national 
movement, as political movement does not equal socio-economic freedom”. 
I also attended a Peace Group Meeting and learnt about the Truth Commission and 
Peace Dialogues in Columbia, which are powerful processes. 
Attendees to the activist meeting were all asked whether we knew of mechanisms for 
a 1) petition 2) debate 3) referendum, or 4) inquiry. I said I didn’t think that Indonesia 
had a particular referendum mechanism…but maybe we could? 
We were asked, what does it mean to be free? 
 
4) The other punishments are lots of psychological manipulation through AI, media, 
shaming, blame for outbreaks. 
5) The retaliation, where biotech products are released/unleashed deployed without 
explanation or regulation or permit, to make the population sick and open the way for 
harsher measures to be implemented, or the nation to be isolated from trade, visitors 
and freedoms, rights, income etc and of course injections. 
 
People’s return to Natural status, Common Law, where men and women are the 
beneficiaries  of their lives, efforts and energy and free from Maritime law, where 
people are only persons and debtors. The Great Freeset, is an organization for more 
information.  
 
January 19th 2024: War, Water, AI and the United Nations 
War, Water, AI and The UN 
The unwillingness to provide (by regulation or by law) the gene sequences - of each 
biotech product given an experimental permit for use in Indonesia - would have 
massive consequences for Indonesia. The full list of active and inactive ingredients, 
including the exact gene sequences of microbial strains of diseases must be used as 
‘parameters’ to test and filter drinking water, the Subak, the Sawah and the coastal 
waters for qualitative and quantitative monitoring of the engineered products’ 
persistence in nature, and transference to other species, including the human 
microbiome.  
 
The refusal to share this information could be the Indonesian key to exposing the 
criminality of the WHO, UN and their funders and their intention to do harm and 
criminal damage. “Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation,…Gavi, the global vaccine 
organization that Gates helped to found to inoculate people in low-income nations, 

the Wellcome Trust, Sir Jeremy Farrah - now WHO’s Head Scientist- ran it, and the 
Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, or CEPI, all opposed government 
efforts to waive intellectual property rights, (share samples or exact information) a 
move that critics saw as protecting the interests of pharmaceutical giants over 
people living in poorer nations.” https://www.politico.com/news/2022/09/14/global-
covid-pandemic-response-bill-gates-partners-00053969  
 
The discussion of water exposes the danger of the bigger WHO plan of exchanging 
Potential Pandemic Pathogens internationally, and setting up Bio Labs to engineer 
and store them, as well as the dangers of releasing mosquitoes infected with water-
borne bacteria. The WMP and health minister have refused to share the ingredients 
of the mosquitoes produced, even though their recorded response to the well-known 
risks of Wolbachia in parasitical Filarial diseases was that the Wolbachia was a 
‘different’ strain and therefore harmless. No independent checking is possible when 
patents are allowed. 
 
All forecasters agree that water is the one thing that wars will be fought over in 
future, and Indonesia must be able to establish regulations that protect ours. The 
WHO and Indonesian Military have agreed to police the implementation of the WHO 
treaty but do not mention water: Clean fresh water for drinking and food, or marine 
protection for our oxygen supply and ecosystems. In addition to the official statement 
for the Senate, this statement could support a refusal by the Intergovernmental 
Working Group to continue, on the grounds of the threat to Indonesia’s water by non-
disclosed biotech, eg in fogging solutions, to which the mosquitoes are resistant but 
is causing widespread Stage One Dementia, while it is still produced in Australia and 
smoked directly into people’s homes in Indonesia. What has also not been disclosed 
is the Wolbachia IP Technology coupled with Microsoft’s CCN Artificial Intelligence. 
 
I feel that if Indonesia’s Senate could raise awareness of the militarization of AI, as it 
follows the military protocol of retaliation, rather than peace-building and how it is 
being used in mapping the deployment of bombs and mosquito eggs, the Senate 
could also call for a moratorium on AI - starting with the Wolbachia IP Technology, 
Elon Musk/T Mobile experimental permit and the flagrant use by super-powers in air 
strikes, on the grounds that AI constitutes a radiological weapon of mass destruction. 
If we don’t stop it now or get a postponement, AI will determine all future governance 
and decisions on military terms. Furthermore, Microsoft will protect its AI customers 
from legal responsibility, another layer of indemnity from the diplomatic immunity of 
the WHA and another support to the military arguments that no pathogens or digital 
information should be shared as it could be misused. Our statement should say that 
it is already being misused. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-
07/microsoft-says-it-will-protect-customers-from-ai-copyright-lawsuits 
 
This is a big claim but also heroic, and means Indonesia might be able to stop the 
bombing of Gaza and the Yemen, as well as the deployment of the mosquitoes in 
Asian and African countries, and North and South America. The examples for which 
there needs to be an enquiry, include an investigation into whether the AI being used 
to map the deployment of mosquitoes eggs in Bali triggered the retaliation by the 
bombing of an Indonesian Hospital in Gaza, when the deployment was blocked on 
safety and efficacy grounds. Also, an investigation is needed into whether the same 
AI mapping is being used for the deployment of bombs by Israel, UK and US in Gaza 

and that the AI has increased civilian targets from 50 a year that could be identified 
by human means, to 100 targets a day, 50 of which are being bombed - as has been 
reported. This also relates to the shift in American military strategy, where President 
Obama approved the bombing of “Signature Groups” rather than actual terrorist 
threats. Signature groups include anyone related to someone who has been killed or 
maimed in conflict. UK “Government officials are using artificial intelligence (AI) and 
complex algorithms to help decide everything from who gets benefits to who should 
have their marriage licence approved, according to a Guardian investigation.23 Oct 
2023 https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/oct/23/uk-officials-use-ai-to-
decide-on-issues-from-benefits-to-marriage-
licences#:~:text=Government%20officials%20are%20using%20artificial,according%
20to%20a%20Guardian%20investigation 
 
This would contribute to world peace in general and perhaps provide an opportunity 
to claim compensation, if the Senate endorse the statement that AI and all the Smart 
Technologies need to be postponed.  https://www.hlp.city/smart-governance-a-
hybrid-of-civic-technology-iot-and-local-

This is not a health treaty it is war game and AI is a military tool, created, funded, 
produced and protected by the eugenicist (someone who believes that the world 
population must be diminished) technology, Microsoft and Bill Gates. 
 
Water Testing 
 https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/12/1/bali-the-tropical-indonesian-island-that-
is-running-out-of-water  
Indonesia’s statement that can be used in every other member state after: 
 
My experience was registering as an organic farmer in Ireland and finding out that 
my water could not be tested for AMPA and Glyphosate in Ireland, even though 
Round Up with these active ingredients, is the most common farm spray. This means 
drinking water isn’t tested or filtered for it either. 
 
Our statement must say that the sharing of a continually-updated list of new testing 
parameters and the recording of their appearance in the water is crucial to ensure 
the safety of incoming biotech, for both health and environmental products - 
vaccines, mosquitoes and fogging solutions, as well as marine and Carbon Capture 
and Storage. 
 
Professor Suriyadarma, in Tabanan, teaches botany in Bali as well as Jogyakarta. 
He spoke at our Bali Solidarity flier handout and meeting with the Governor's office in 
the Denpasar park on 5th November.  He also is head of the Indonesian Botanic 
Gardens on Hawaii. He said he would communicate with the Irrigation company on 
Maui who were stake holders in the mosquito releases there and ask if they actually 
released the mosquitoes into the waterways or what details of the release/program 
and gene sequence, the irrigation company were given and their role. Maui is 
important (maybe not for the official statement but as an example of Gene-edited 
organisms and micro-organisms contamination, where only deep scorching of the 
ground can stop the contamination from spreading.  

 
So I think that a sentence or paragraph about genetic engineering and water testing 
parameters from your professional view? We could also point out that that monitoring 
could have been done by AI but instead, the presence of AI technology and license 
were not disclosed. Instead of monitoring, the biotech and pharmaceutical industry 
are simply saying gene editing does not create GMOs and that the mosquitoes and 
the pathogen strains used to create ‘vaccines’ are “substantially equivalent” to 
natural products and are harmless and don’t need monitoring.  
 
When I ran this by Professor Northcott for his professional opinion, as expert of  bio 
cultural heritage and commons governance - including genetic engineering and the

21st January: Official Statement to Indonesian Senate - Possible Conclusion: 
This statement refers mainly to the WHO Treaty but applies to all international 
governance by the WEF, the IHR and amendments, GAVI, WHA, Conference of the 
parties, UN ‘Climate Action’, the military, and Artificial Intelligence.  
If Indonesia fails to actively reject any of the agreements, full executive powers and 
security silently pass to organizations that are protected from financial and 
operational liability. Simultaneously, the Indonesian government will remain 
responsible but lose the authority and ability to exercise control over any financial or 
operational risks.  
Any external instruction to proliferate weapons of mass destruction; Radiological 
(Smart) Biological (medical, mosquito & green ‘biotech’) and Nuclear, will be legally 
binding and implemented as a military protocol.  
Regardless of negotiations and final wording, control of the technology and data 
remain with the patent holders.  
 
19th March 2023 
Speech that UN Defense Ministers should be delivering to the people now as the 
vaccine manufacturers start to admit in court that their products killed or are 
threatened with mass releases. 
I have respectfully asked my esteemed colleague if I may open this speech with a 
humble apology to the people of Indonesia. We have failed to protect you and 
Hankamrata, Total People Defense is our greatest responsibility. 
First I want to acknowledge four years of tragic and criminal mismanagement of a 
pandemic. The pandemic was declared by the World Health Organization and 
measures to control it were provided by the World Health Organization. 
In our ignorance of the science, we implemented the World Health Organization’s 
health strategies without question, including vaccines using patented, experimental 
technology and even mandated them. We acknowledge that they damaged and 
killed a vast amount of our people. In addition, we acquiesced to the Ministry of 
Health’s advice to maintain the hardest, longest lockdowns in the world and make no 
provision for the people. 
In September, we were alerted to another World Health Organization ‘health 
strategy’ being implemented in Indonesia; the release of hundreds of millions of 
Aedes Aegypti Mosquitoes, intentionally infected with Wolbachia bacteria. This time, 
the science was delivered to the Defence Department, and for that we are very 
grateful. 

I have to inform you, you should not consent if you are asked to incubate World 
Mosquito Program eggs. 
 Wolbachia bacteria is not safe. Editing the genes of microbes and any living 
organism is not safe. The Gene Drive Technology is not safe. The Wolbachia Gain of 
Function is not safe. The mass release of breeding, biting female mosquitoes is not 
safe. The inclusion of secret IP Technology to collect data is neither safe nor lawful. 
It is with horror that our President, and indeed all International Defence and 
Biosecurity Departments and Heads of State, should now see the World Health 
Organization, the charitable organizations that provide a false front for their health 
strategies and the funders, providers and Health Ministry facilitators, complicit in this 
grave endangerment of our people. 
Although this is no excuse, government ministers were not informed or given the 
required opportunity to discuss the World Mosquito Program health strategy, to mass 
release mosquitoes. 
Thankfully we had the choice, and made the right choice, to postpone the mass 
mosquito release in Bali and conduct a thorough investigation. At least, that is what 
we were promised by the police and Central Intelligence, but there has been a 
disturbing lack of action to stop the mosquito program releases in other places, even 
after police charges were filed. 
We all now know that, after May this year, we will no longer have a choice. The 
disturbing amendments to the IHR that make all the WHO’s recommendations legally 
binding instead of just advise. The Health Minister has agreed to receiving a vast 
Pandemic Preparedness fund, to implement the World Health Organization’s 
mandates. Indonesia’s Armed Forces have been hijacked to prepare to police 
Indonesian people to adhere to new international laws, drawn up by the World 
Health Organization. On their joint website between Indonesia’s Armed Forces and 
the WHO, they commit to orchestrating ‘Protracted Crisis’. In real terms, this means 
the WHO and UN can declare an international emergency and lockdown Indonesia 
for years if they want. The Treaty holds no process for declaring the END of a 
pandemic. The surveillance and restrictions could go on forever. The UN’s control of 
resources, national decision-making and the control of the budget are intended to go 
on forever. 
The Treaty also includes the requirement for Indonesia to purchase and use any 
genetically engineered product the funders of the World Health Organization want to 
sell to Indonesia. That might be technology for the environment, military or for 
injection into our men, women and children. Even if all our doctors, lawyers and 
other experts say a technology is not safe or effective. Even if it has been shown to 
directly kill a lot of people. Significantly, Indonesia is expected to share disease 
pathogens with the WHO so that their pharmaceutical industry funders can 
reproduce them and then created weaponised vaccine programs. All for profit and 
with no legal liability for the damage they will do. We fought this battle in 2008 and 
won. Indonesia, with Siti Fadilah Supari’s expertise and discernment, remain the only 
country to have ever shut down a military bio lab. We must not let them build more. 
Today, I believe it is important to make an open commitment to demanding 
compensation from the World Health Organization Pandemic Fund, and the 
immediate removal of the Minister for Health, department staff and other officials 
who have financially benefited from withholding critical information about the WHO’s 
Pandemic Treaty and changes to the International Health Regulations, from 
Bappenas. 
There is now only 2 weeks left for the Indonesian President to save Indonesia by 

saying no to the WHO. 
I urge all other member states, as well, to question their delegates to the World 
Health Assembly. Indeed, The World Health Assembly and World Economic Forum 
have been proven ‘not fit for purpose’ and must be removed from their offices and 
from the protection of diplomatic immunity in Switzerland. Police charges have been 
filed against Switzerland’s President insisting he remove the diplomatic immunity and 
deport the organizations from Switzerland. 
By rejecting these Amendments and Treaties, Indonesia will retain the right to do a 
proper Financial, Legal and Operational Due Diligence in the unelected and 
unaccountable World Health Organization. This must be before they announce their 
legally-binding authority over our health, public budgets, and biosecurity. 
 
So far, it has been shown that the World Health Organisation’s Pandemic 
Preparedness health strategies do not work and are not intended to work. To 
genetically engineer diseases with greater fatality rates and greater transmissibility, 
in order to prepare a vaccine is an unacceptably dangerous business plan. We will 
not tolerate Indonesia again being a captured market. 
If we do not send the notice, we will have no choices. If we do not withdraw from the 
WHO, we will lose all our rights as a nation. 
I was asked to speak and use the authority of the Defence Department to veto the 
mosquito program, as a biological attack on the nation. That was 3 months ago, and 
we recognised that a release could indeed carry biosafety hazards. Since then, 
however, eminent scientists have admitted a series of disturbing consequences to 
releases including the introduction of 11 new diseases with the laboratory-grown 
mosquitoes. Also the American smart technology of our proposed new capital city, 
has been shown to be connected to the foreign control of all smart infrastructure 
through the same AI as contained in all the weaponised vectors and vaccines. 
Even the production and research of genetically engineered products, drugs and 
foods in Indonesia should not be tolerated. I would like to make a commitment that 
there will be the safe destruction and removal of all foreign technologies and GMOs, 
in its disease control and surveillance strategies. This includes reconsidering the 
dangerous link between Wolbachia IP Technology, 5G Technology Infrastructure 
and the running of our new capital and other so-called smart cities. The risk of 
external control and the intrusion on people’s health, privacy and bodily integrity will 
be stopped. 
 
I hope you can accept our apology for not identifying this war on Indonesia until now. 
Please be filled with hope now by the vision we have for a different future. 
Help us build it into a reality with our heightened consciousness of the dark deeds 
and forces that sovereign nations and people are facing, and a feeling of major 
empowerment that it was you the people who protected this land of the Gods and the 
blessings will be great. 
 
30th January 2024 
Richard C Cook replies about all the alleged National Debts which we must clear in 
our Federal Supreme Court Appeal 
Basically, nations of the Global South (used to be Third World or LDCs-Less 
Developed Countries) are attacked with loans they have to get from Western banks 
to meet expenses when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates.  
Then they run to the IMF to borrow more money from Western banks. But they have 

"conditionalities" imposed on them, which means selling off public assets like water 
systems, allowing foreign companies to come in to mine their resources, then cutting 
expenditures for government, education, and public services, which all means 
essentially selling their countries to the big banks and hedge funds. It's now being 
done to Ukraine, where Hedge Funds like BlackRock are even buying up their farm 
land. If politicians resist there is regime change where they are forced out of office by 
rigged elections or even assassinated. A book about all this is "Confessions of an 
Economic Hit Man." 
It's all high-level crime.

Military Criteria:  
Conditions an effective biological weapon has to meet 
1) Cost 
“The purely financial advantage of employing biological weapons was clearly 
illustrated by a 1969 expert United Nations panel  
which estimated the cost of operations against civilian populations at $1/Km2 for 
biological weapons, versus $600/Km2 for chemical, $800/Km(2)2 for nuclear,  
and $2,000/Km2 for conventional armaments” FAS, 2021 
2)  Many ways genetic engineering creates potentially dangerous bioweapons.  
Unintentionally:  Mutation, Not looking for Failures, Counter Indications and Variants, 
Knowingly: Counter Indications and Variants, Intentionally: Gains of function, added 
IP Technology  
3) increase human-to-human transmission of a deadly pathogen - Now called Gain 
of Function 
African Transgenic Mosquito “The insects deliver live malaria-causing Plasmodium 

parasites that have been genetically modified to not get people sick.” 
4) Make an existing pathogen resistant to existing vaccines, therapeutics, or other 
countermeasures  
Antibiotic Resistance, Fogging  
5) Procurement: one has to be able to procure a suitable biological agent. 
 “The NATO definition of a biological agent is: A microorganism (or a toxin derived 
from it) which causes disease in man, plants or animals  
or which causes the deterioration of material.” They include Bacteria, Viruses, 
Rickettsiae, Chlamydia, Parasites, Fungi and Toxins. Logistics Supply Chain - 
Exemptions 
6) Mass production - A bioweapon needs to be produced at scale without the loss of 
pathogenicity,   
making microorganisms effective as self-propagating. BioBanks and Mosquito 
Factories 
7) Effective delivery: a biological agent typically needs to be deployed quickly and en 
masse to achieve its  
maximum impact before effective countermeasures can be deployed. Vector, 
Vaccine, Fogging and Artificial Intelligence  
8) Environmentally robust: a biological agent needs to be able to survive in the 
environment and spread. Gene Driive 
9) Treatable: the agent that releases a biological agent needs to have an effective 
countermeasure to  
prevent incurring damage from the biological agent.  Oxitec imparts Antibiotic 
Resistance to Bacterial Pathogens - Kill Gene - AI ‘Stop the spread’ 
10) “Consequences of Individual Agents For Continued Operational Effectiveness”, 
they include over 40 examples of biological agents, for example, Epidemic Typhus 
and Pneumonic Plague but also Dengue has been used. 
 
Africa Slide 6: Gates gives 7 billion and asks for 50 billion for Africa 
Compromised Position: Who Can Say No?

Delegates: Incentives and control of budgets 
Conference of the Parties:Treason, criminal responsibility 
Courts: No more negotiation and notices, letters and illusion of working together.

Targets: Signature groups 
If we consider ourselves under attack by the WHO, their surveillance infrastructure, 
and hold a grievance about the loss of life through the pandemic or children’s 
vaccines or , we become a ‘signature group. During Obama’s term, opened 
legitimate civilian targets from targets to signature groups; whoever may hold a 
grievance. This leaves whole countries open to retaliation for withdrawing from the 
WHO, like Iran, Indonesia and Russia. 
 
If we take a stand we must take a major stand and defend borders 
If we don’t, the genocide will just play out.

7. Selection for more virulent arboviruses 
Although there was evidence that the mosquito populations were majorly reduced 
(by between 90% and 96%), there was no evidence that there were fewer cases of 
dengue fever or Zika virus, both carried by the Aedes Aegypti mosquito. 
Furthermore, up until 2015, Zika was considered a benign disease, with no 
symptoms but the Zika epidemic that spread in Brazil in 2015 and 2016, registered 
over 200,000 cases of babies born with brain defects, from the infection (Lowe, 
2018). If there is any chance at all that genetically engineered mosquitoes could 
drive the development of a deadly variant of a previously harmless virus, another 
release should be deemed unacceptable. 
 
Replacement of dengue vectors  During Oxitec’s Brazil release, 450,000 GE 
mosquitos were released every week for two years from 2013-2015 in Jacobina.

Untrue Public Information and Criminal Ministerial Responsibility 
 
In the Brazil field trials, Oxitec did not perform experiments to assess whether GM 

mosquitoes might persist in the wild (Powell, 2019). All governments, including the 
US, have little or no regulatory oversight for gene edited GMOs. They based this 
hands-off policy on the false belief that gene editing is safe, predictable and even of 
benefit to public health. As another research group pointed out, public education is 
not the same as public consultation (Powell, 2019). With such vast numbers of GE 
insects proposed to be released in densely populated areas, a public referendum 
should perhaps be called to ensure public awareness and involvement in the 
decision-making process. 
 
Conclusion: 
Mosquito releases insert surveillance biotech and cause an increased blood-feeding 
intensity among female adults, the mosquitoes’ ability to find blood meals ed 
manner. 
However, up-to-date knowledge should be followed and taken into consideration for 
the program to be able to immediately respond to changes in hazards or potential 
increases in risk.

immunization schedule and product recommendations for COVID-19.  WHO also 
issued key immunization programmatic recommendations on polio, IA2030 and 
recovering the immunization programme. The R21 vaccine is the second malaria 
vaccine recommended by WHO, following the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine, which received

Overview. Zika is a mosquito-borne virus, similar to dengue fever, yellow fever and 
West Nile virus. zika compared to japanese encephalitis 
How Zika evolved after mosquito release into more like Japanese Encephalitis. What 
we know. “Zika virus disease is generally mild, and severe disease requiring 
hospitalization and deaths are uncommon. Zika infection during pregnancy can 
cause serious birth defects and is associated with other pregnancy problems”. “Zika 
virus (ZIKV) has been shown to be highly neurotropic; neurologic disorders are a 
common complication of this infection. Encephalitis-an inflammation of the brain 
parenchyma associated with neurologic dysfunction-is a rare complication of ZIKV 
infections.” 
 
“People in the trial areas have not provided their consent to being experimented on 
with OX5034. 
The most common occurrence in genetic engineering is unexpected side effects. For 
example, when male mosquitoes were produced in an experiment that eliminated 
their attraction to the scent of the female mosquitoes and their inclination to mate, 
the males developed an attraction instead to human blood, which previously only 
females expressed (Tracey, 2020)” Ref: Frances’ White Paper GM Mosquitoes from 
a Microbial Perspective 
 
Open releases of GM insects – particularly GM mosquitoes – into the environment to 
date have not delivered on their promises. Misleading hype has led to significant 
opportunity costs and the exposure of people to unnecessary risks. These mistakes 
must 
be avoided in the future but run the real 

risk of being repeated in Africa, where there 
“is growing distrust in African institutions’ inability to create conditions of openness, 
transparency, inclusion, accountability and good governance and where biosafety 
capacity is either non-existent or sorely lacking”.

Introduction to Anna Von Reitz, Judge and responsible for Family Trusts, for the 
Benefit of Humanity 
 
Dear Anna, 
I was delighted and relieved to hear of your work from Stephen of English Counties 
Assembly. At first, i couldn't imagine that there were reserves of money assigned for 
the benefit of humanity. Then i remembered my father who was a judge, in the high 
court and circuit courts, telling me of a difficulty with legacies. The example was that 
many elderly people leave legacies for 'the lifeboats' in their wills. This meant that 
the RNLI who run the lifeboats in England and Ireland at least, could only spend the 
money on their lifeboat services and not on developing their cliff and air rescue 
services. Now I reallize this is a mechanism that must also have been used 
consciously by men and women to determine how their legacies are spent.  
 
I understand that you are sharing the resources to sovereign nations and only to 
men and women who have formally corrected their status, which I have. My Claim of 
Fact and Declaration of Dominion, my Affidavit of Clear Perfect Allodial Land Title 
and my Trust are all dated to 2nd October 2021. 
  
i, woman frances am writing to inquire if you would authorize the seeding of multiple 
public banks that will use water as their reserve basis "golden peg"and support 
subsistence farms. Food Sovereignty and Water Security Proposal  
 
 
I built a dedicated website in 2021 to start membership and contribution to some 
public banks https://green-business-consultancy.ie/public-banking-ireland/. I hoped 
to secure European Green Deal funding. I also tendered to manage the National 
Biodiversity Data Centre, which would have been a powerful data base to use to 
decide lending criteria. I was briefly considered an Irish 'government partner in 
working with Germany's Sparkassen international Cooperation Arm's, Harald Felzen, 
in defining a public banking rollout for ireland - the plan is attached. I also worked 
closely with the Public Banking Alliance who are amazingly knowledgeable and 
competent, including my friend Diarmaid Mulcahy.  
 
In the last few months I have been helping a leadership group Gladiator Bangsa - 
Professor Richard Claproth, Dr Kun and Siti Fadilah, navigate for Indonesia, as well 
as for African countries, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, Brazil, Ireland and 
Britain, a way out of their alleged national debts and the compromised permissions 
and approvals they have given to biotech pharmaceuticals and nuclear, and their 
sovereignty give-aways.  
 

In the past, I thought compensation would have to come through the courts, having 
found the misuse of technologies to harm as premeditated. Now I hope that we can 
go ahead and build our Jural Assemblies and education systems without interfacing 
with the corporate system for money to do it. 
 
I have lived in private for two and half years, signed off the voting, medical, tax, 
business and land registers. I have returned Frances Micklem's birth certificate. I 
also have my post sent to another address to avoid making my home a public 
building. I even went off the mains electricity grid. A group of 15 close friends and a 
1000 in a wider circle corrected our status' to living men and women around the 
same time. We all live in eire (Ireland) but reconnected with our national heritage. 
Can we be one assembly as there is no more than one of us from each ancient 
county, in our own nations, who is ready to assemble? For example, I was born in 
Buckinghamshire but I do not know anyone in Bckingham, and I haven't been there 
for 40 years. 
 
The public banking team are international. In addition, i am connected to groups in 
England who are embarking on the status correction journey and keen to form 
assemblies in our ancient counties in Great Britain.  
 
Those of us who have corrected our status hoped we would become the 
beneficiaries of our corporate trusts, or beneficiaries in some way. I have been 
practicing exercising my power of attorney over my legal fiction while trying to avoid 
making joinder all over again with the main institutions and police with their ever-
increasing emergency powers - the reason I had to leave my home in Ireland last 
year.  
I will hold on to it, if it is to be the public bank it was built to be, where everything is 
as it should be. However, without resources or recourse to support in legal matters,.I 
was thinking of selling my property, so I made enquiries about using a usual estate 
agent and solicitor, which would be disappointing. What we believe needs to happen 
in terms of housing is that public banks can eventually buy the whole portfolio of 
mortgages and reduce their inflated values and mortgages to a sustainable level that 
reflects the true value. https://publicbankingalliance.ie/ 
 
 
in regard to my personal circumstances. As I hope to keep volunteering my writing 
and other advocacy engagements which are more than full time already, I added a 
Go Fund Me to the financial website and also have my other website 
http://www.alternativehealthconsultancy.ie with a donation to paypal button. I also 
have copious books and paintings for sale. Neither website, nor my advocacy, 
creations or educational services have made a regular income, so please let me 
know if it is legitimate for individuals to receive resources from the legacies you 
manage. 
 
I heard that you have arranged to distribute Federal dollars which intrinsically hold 
value? What do you suggest for other currencies? I have noticed in pounds, euros 
and Asian bank notes, they are replacing them with notes reinforced with blood and 
other 'byproducts' from pigs. I want the new infrastructure we build to reflect total 
awareness of others and our impact, so I look forward to hearing how we can 
develop a currency for each nation's public banks with this increased value but 

without misusing animals. Also to this end, I became friends with the US' Humane 
Party a few years ago, who have provided a shareable non-exploitative, complete 
economic plan, which I think would be appropriate to adapt to each nation.

aY6Uh3vTNpBoBDf2dfkMSo6rZ4Qgcs 
 
 
Proof of corrected status: 
1. Claim of Fact and Declaration of Dominion. I chose purple text, relating, i believe, 
to my adherence to the Law of the Air.  I follow "the three laws: keep the peace, do 
no harm, treat others as you would like to be treated yourself' so I hope I 
"automatically fulfil all other laws and stand above any other form of law." I have 
done this by being vegan for over twenty years and developing mastery, harmony 
and my inner authority.   
2. Deeds of Allodial Rights to my private property, wheereby I "junked the title" and 
withdrew my home from the land registry. establishing my sovereign responsibility for 
the land and soil. 
3. My Certification of Trust 
4. Declaration of Status, Property and Obligation (B) 
5. Second Page of Status Property and obligation 
6. Third page of Status property and obligation 
7.Birth Certificate Revoked and Returned to State issuer 
8. Notice of Return That Accompanied Birth Certificate Exhibit B 
9. Autograph for Declaration and all Exhibits and Attachments 
10.Index of Documents 
 
Stephen of the British Assemblies is a brilliant activist and a fountain of knowledge. I 
was glad to meet him two weeks ago and i look forward to working with him. 
However, he dismissed my corrected status and said I would have to do the 
documents he has prepared to be eligible for your backing. Is that true?  
 
I feel I have gone a considerable and even exemplary way with the process, for 
myself and my property.  
 
In addition, I think my efforts are best focused now - before the incoming WHO 
Treaty and UN Sustainablity Treaty - on making alternative provision by way of 
public banks in each member state. I have the beginnings of the core team and they 
will be willing to correct their status once they understand it is a prerequisite to 
financing the banks.  
 
Also very active already are huge swathes of good lawyers, doctors and every other 
unvaccinated man and woman with competent inner authority. For example, in the 
World Council For Health, of which I am a part. My idea is to propose that each 
nation or maybe just all large-scale projects you fund should commit to being an 
organic "control group", and then record how the population's health and the soil's 
fertility recover, to help nations refuse the smart technology experimental permits.

Information sent to WCH Eire 
1. Elon Musk who owns X, responsible for Disease X caused by Electroporation 
The genetic modification that can be carried out remotely through electrical pulse. 
2. Abbot Laboratories with no planning permission 
3. South African lawyers file charges of War Crimes to US, UK and Israel 
 
1. This disease X directly correlates to Elon Musk's 180 day experimental permit, a 
Space X project started about 2 months ago. In the same way as earlier world-wide 
malaise follow new technologies, eg Spanish Flu followed the implementation of 
radio. The permit has been granted to use his satellites that are in position already to 
interact with T mobile devices. T mobile have a massive lawsuit already of 350 
million, that they've had to pay on violations tracker 
(https://violationtracker.goodjobsfirst.org/violation-tracker/-t-mobile-7)  
 
I was hoping Congressman Dan Fernandes and his team (connected positively with 
Dr Marivic WCH) would challenge this permit to see if they could still muster the 
authority to stop it, pending due diligence. Congress are in theory over the Federal 
Communications body that gave the approval. If they can't stop it, it means national 
governments have already lost control. If Congress can stop it, they could unearth all 
the unlawfulness of data collection, remote genetic engineering (where pulses can 
engineer genetic changes in the body: Electric pulses 
"Electroporation" designates the use of electric pulses for gene transfer - explained 
in the Bioweapons paper and 
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16096009/#:~:text=Electroporation%20designates%
20the%20use%20of,transiently%20permeabilize%20the%20cell%20membrane.) 
and threat to health of the new technology. This experiment is on all nations and 
constitutes a radiological weapon of mass destruction. This connects with, counter-
indicates and is in addition to the MMWave 
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9203081/that is being rolled out 
across UK https://www.computerweekly.com/news/365532575/UK-regulator-gives-
green-light-to-5G-mmWave-developmentand no doubt Ireland which can also deliver 
gene sequences and disrupt our own. And of course the relationship between smart 
infrasturcture, 5G, all the vaccinated and all those bitten by the Wolbachia IP 
Technology coupled with Microsoft CNN AI, as well as all the inanimate devices.  
I think there Eamon Ryan should answer about the roll-out of 5G during the 

lockdown and safety etc. amongst other things of course! There is not one doctor on 
the governing board. When I asked Malcolm Noonan, he said 'The WHO says its 
safe' so it could be another way to show that Ireland shouldn't take WHO's 
recommendations. 
 
2) There are the Abbott pharmaceuticals factories - 800 jobs they promoted it as 
offering in Kilkenny, that didn't have to put in any environmental impact statement 
and is on a green field site.What they are actually contributing to, no doubt is the 
computerization of the human body. - Freestyle Libre technology means that sensors 
are inserted under the skin to monitor. In reality the monitoring is a two-way street 
and will no doubt will connect to wifi. It is a clinical laboratory, which I gather means 
there will be animal testing. When I made an objection to the planning office, it hadn't 
gone to the Kilkenny County Council but straight to An Bord Pleanala. Neither would 
share the strategy to manage animals, data, or environmental hazards, despite 
violations in the past, ruining water sources and poor employer cases - 700 million in 
government contracting and 27 million in saafety non compliance 
(https://violationtracker.goodjobsfirst.org/parent/abbott-laboratories 
 
3) I have been in contact with the Palestinian support board in Ireland about South 
African lawyers have filed charges against the UK and US, as well as Israel for war 
crimes. I think I sent that to Eddie as well.

First contact with Kingdom of Hawaii who are threatened with 20 years of military lab 
altered insects - on an emergency permits on no grounds, with no human health 
impact study and wild breaches of the Nuremburg Code. Complete Conflicts of 
Interest Slide Presentations  - Fahrie Hassan -sent. 
 
I watched the Nina Lia interview, please thank her, on CHDTV. I was also 
interviewed about the Mosquitoes as Biowarfare (Indonesia) on CHDTV, which was 
aired yesterday. https://live.childrenshealthdefense.org/chd-tv/shows/good-morning-
chd/ As I listened to Nina, I took some notes of things I wanted to add in case they're 
helpful. Secondly, I wish you well on the appeal. I really feel that we (all member 
states) should unite as the appeal is the only relevant court case actually happening 
before the WHO treaty is passed (if you can raise the 30,000, and therefore a 
chance for a proper pushback against the criminality of the whole thing. I am working 
on an affidavit for Bali, and wider Indonesia against their mosquito deployment. We 
got a postponement on the Bali Wolbachia Mosquito release and the day we 
achieved that, an Indonesian Hospital was bombed in Palestine - that is how 
determined the military/biotech industry, coupled to Artificial Intelligence, is to push 
these destructive projects forwards. In Indonesia, there are criminal charges filed 
with the police against the World Mosquito Program and Save the Children Fund (the 
implementers), and a civil case against the health minister/WHO delegate. It sounds 
like your health minister is awake, which is a blessing but maybe he is not Hawaii's 
WHO delegate? You seem to have an awful lot of agencies as 'stake holders' in the 
attack on your islands. To get you started with your conflicts of interest, I will send 
you Fahrie's work and you might be able to track who has received money from 
whom to allow this. I remember reading that Maui's Irrigation Company were 
‘partners’, so they should make a statement as to why they are allowing/facilitating 
this larva crisis and pollution. A professor and friend is head of the Indonesian 

Botanic Gardens in Hawaii and is willing to communicate with the Irrigation Company 
on their participation. He spoke at our rally, in Denpasar, on Bali.  
 
Nina said that you had been reassured that if things go wrong, the species will be 
'replaced'. That means that they plan a gene drive. A gene drive is the only way you 
can replace a species. It is a military technology being promoted as for conservation. 
On my interview, it shows the world-wide petition against gene drives. Until recently 
they were forbidden for open-air release as too dangerous. The petition was 
endorsed by something like 300 conservationists. I wonder if you could get Jane 
Goodall or David Attenborough to make a statement. I am sure that Jim Thomas of 
ETC would be an expert witness and others from the Institute For Responsible 
Technology. 
 
It is our plan in Indonesia to see if a high impact experimental permit like this can be 
withdrawn through usual national authorities, before the WHO Treaty is passed. The 
theory is that if they can't stop the project, it means that they have already lost 
sovereign control of decisions and that will galvanise them into action to exit the 
WHO. If a national regulatory authority can stop the project, it will allow all the 
information to come out and discredit the WHO, and "pandemic preparedness" in all 
its dangerous applications and undisclosed intentions and ramifications. This will 
empower other member states to act too.  
 
So, I heard Nina say that Bill Gates was involved at the very beginning with the first 
laboratories. This is significant as it was when the Wolbachia IP Technology coupled 
with CNN AI was smuggled into the bacteria. It was the same here in Indonesia. The 
universities in Yogyakarta were adamant that the mosquitoes were natural and the 
wolbachia bacteria was natural. This is because Bill Gates laboratories had done the 
gene editing before the mass production and academic institutions were engaged (to 
incentivise and achieve manufactured consent respectively).  
 
The World Mosquito Program scientists argued the wolbachia mosquitoes are 
infected with a different strain to the Wolbachia living in human parasites (in Falarial 
disease, river blindness and Elephantitus etc) and different strain to the fish and 
birds who eat the most larvae. We asked for the strain to be shared with Bali's EPA 
and doctors so they could monitor the spread and if it started appearing in diseases 
or drinking water. We asked 81 questions actually, in our Due Diligence questions 
where we sought to understand how comparable the Safety Trials in Yogyakarta 
were to the deployment in Bali. You can imagine, I really appreciated Nina talking 
about the "super infections" - which, I think, refer to the presence of many different 
strains of bacteria? Please send me any more information on this.  
 
Nina mentioned West Nile virus and Japanese Encephalitis amongst other 
pathogens showing up, and I believe that another professor would give evidence of 
his meeting with the WMP scientists when they confirmed that after the release of 
the mosquitoes - Aedes Aegypti both male and female in this experiment - there was 
a massive spike in the Culex species and they had brought Japanese Encephalitis 
and 5 children had contracted it at least, one died quickly, and immediately a 
Japanese Encephalitis vaccine for children was nearly rolled out but thankfully 
stopped. This wasn't recorded.  
 

In fact Microsoft AI did the Risk assessment, the mapping of the deployment and of 
course the Microsoft CNN Technology in the mosquito which should be used for 
monitoring but isn't. Only for surveillance, or control or bioligal data collection, 
vaccination or whatever its capacity is but it transmits via the 5G network, being built 
for smart cities. Its terms of the Nuremberg code, there is a case that these early GM 
bacteria of Bill Gates constitute 'commissioning a crime' against humanity and 
against peace for that matter. As well, the code says categorically that informed 
consent must be sought for experiments on human subjects.  
 
Also I would like to see if your case mentions the convention for the non proliferation 
of weapons of mass destruction. What is being done to Hawaii, Indonesia and 
indeed all UN Member states are intentionally and unintentionally being deployed 
offensively, against people as, after all, mosquitoes feed on human blood, as well as 
interacting dangerously in the environment.  
 
I have more notes but I want to get this off and make contact at least and say that we 
in Indonesia are here to help and ready to act. I also wanted to make sure you are 
aware that the only way to get rid of a biological contamination is through scorching. 
I have a colleague who will be able to give evidence as well that it was the Space X 
army that carried out the targeted incineration of Maui last September. There was 
also an amnesty for the disposal of pesticides in Maui around the same time which 
would be worth investigating. Biopesticides may well have been among them and it 
was held at a secret destination.  
 
I believe that Hawaii is being used as a remote experimentation area to test 
bioweapons. In September the UN will be prescribing the mining of many resources 
and deployment of a huge amount of biotech, in the name of conservation. I think 
Nina raised this point. Indonesia, will be forced to extract and contribute its resources 
and every nation will be complicit and deeply financially committed to the WHO.  
 
I have written to Anna Von Reitz, a judge in America about the use of family trust 
funds, dedicated for the good of men and women. I will write again and see if she 
would sponsor the appeal hearing. It is true, I haven't heard back from her yet but 
each communication starts a ripple of hope and this message comes with much 
respect and support for all you are doing at Hawaii Unites.

Request to South African lawyer firm who filed criminal charges of War Crimes, to 
get several innocent men out of prison to witness and give testimony. 
 
Thank you for your time on the telephone today and for addressing the war crimes. 
I am grateful for this opportunity to add  
1) the use of artificial Intelligence, a military technology weaponized by its retaliation 
protocol. 
2) the extraction of Palestine's natural gas and other resources and  
3) the contravening of the Non proliferation of weapons of mass destruction treaty to 
the crimes and, I'm afraid,  
4) Please add the United Nations to the parties committing these war crimes.  
 
We will need four at least of the men who have made Protected Disclosures who are 
in custody, to give evidence and win their freedom.  
Julian Assange was the first to reveal the UN's perpetuation of conflict.   
Richard Boyle who worked towards the end of Usury and could confirm malpractice 
in the WEF. 

David McBride who blew the whistle on War Crimes in Afghanistan, confirmed by the 
Brereton Report. 
Reiner Fuellmich who was imprisoned as he took the pharmaceutical industry and 
governments to court for genocide during the pandemic. 
 
The precedent in law we have is the woman I volunteer for, previous Health Minister 
of Indonesia who is the only political leader we have in the world, I believe, who has 
been to prison for trying to avoid a biological disaster. The only person who has been 
able to shut down a military laboratory, on biosafety and corruption grounds. She 
also hid a deadly pathogen from the WHO and refused to share samples. It was 
gone when she got out of prison. When she was finally able to track it down, it was in 
Ukraine, where there are reports of terrible experiments and noncompliance in 
American-funded military laboratories there.

This is the problem of Dual Use Research of Concern (DURC) it is justified and 
publicly-funded on health terms but then patented for vaccine profits and the findings 
withheld on defence grounds. I will share a bioweapons paper, that was drafted in 
2021. It talks about non-invasive gene therapy. This relates to Elon Musk's 180 day 
experimental permit to use his satellites for undisclosed purposes but in connection 
with T Mobile devices and 5 and 6G smart infrastructure and networks to collect and 
transmit data and degradation of human health, without any regulatory oversight.  
  
157 of 194 UN Member states have lodged formal reservations, rejections, and 
some even withdrawn formally from the WHO Treaty and the IHR Amendments. All 
the African states have been used for biological experiments on whole communities 
of children. I attach my presentation on the recent live GMO plasmodium parasite- 
Malaria 'vaccines' being administered to children.  
Please don't overlook the biological and radiological war crimes as they are a big 
contender.  
  
Artificial Intelligence 
Artificial Intelligence is a military technology, that follows a retaliatory protocol.  
Following requests for due diligence, before the release of 200 million vectors 
carrying Wolbachia IP Technology coupled with Microsoft CNN AI ,in Indonesia, we 
achieved a postponement on the WHO-approved release. That same night an 
Indonesian maternity Hospital, in Gaza was bombed and destroyed. Then I 
discovered that the

Through the upcoming WHO's Pandemic Treaty, Microsoft AI will seize control of 
and Sustainability treaties.  
 
1. President Obama changed strike targets from actual terrorist targets to 'signature 
groups', allowing any man woman or child with sympathy for the occupied nation 
become a legitimate target.   
2. Drones were brought to Djbouti in 2010 for stirkes in the Yemen.

Review of World Mosquito Program’s Risk Assessment points 50-56 as requested 
 
When I looked up a definition of social conflict it read: The struggle for agency. I 
loved that and realized it is everything we have done since we met. Equally, when it 
comes to Class Actions, these are also all we have done since we met.  We have 
veritably taken one class action after another to consciously participate in changing 
the trajectory for Indonesia. Therefore, I decided to collate a book of evidence in both 
English and Bahasa Indonesia and lodge it with the existing file!! Then at least my 
testimony is there. I also wanted to serve a final notice on a few of the main 
contenders. 
 
 It is taking me weeks and weeks to get it together but I have done the first 120 
pages! I am collating all the reports, research, articles, and notices and proofs of the 
23 charges of Untrue Public Information filed at Bali Police Station. It demonstrates a 
very high risk, indeed incidence, of Social Conflict and Class Action! 
 
I attach the Common Law notice beginning and will send the whole thing on when I 
have it like an ebook, collating the information.  

 
I also wondered today, if you would help or encourage Dr Kun write up an Exit The 
WHO BiIl like this one done for Africa? it might let him lead a new political, people-
based approach in government.

Don’t forget the environment and food security will be ruined by the 5G technology. It 
was never meant to be a service for which we purchase devices to use. It is only 
there as a beam technology to use on us, against us. 
 
5G repercussions for Pollinators 
5G is fine says the World Health Organization 
 The main component of the 5G network is the millimeter waves. A study by the 
Centre for Environment and Vocational Studies of Punjab University, researchers 
observed that after exposure to radiation from a cell tower for just 5-30 minutes, the 
eggs of sparrows were disfigured. 
 
The disfiguration of birds exposed for such a short amount of time to these 
frequencies is significant considering that the new 5G network will have a much 
higher density of base stations (small cells) - every 250 metres.and therefore 
mutations that could easily threaten a whole  population’s survival.  
 
A study done in Spain showed breeding, nesting, and roosting were negatively 
affected by microwave radiation emitted by a cell tower. 
 
Bees are an incredibly important part of the earth’s ecosystem. Around one-third of 
the food produced today is dependent on bees for pollination. Warnke found that 
beehives exposed for just ten minutes to 900MHz waves fell victim to colony 
collapse disorder. Colony collapse disorder is when many of the bees living in the 
hive abandon the hive leaving the queen, the eggs, and a few worker bees. The 
worker bees exposed to this radiation also had worsened navigational skills, causing 
them to stop returning to their original hive after about ten days. 
 
Can I ask that planning permission for the mast they sneaked up here be revoked? I 
just spotted the first time, I've been looking for it for 8 months. There will be others 
I'm sure now I know what I'm looking for. How are we supposed to protect 
biodiversity and grow food if this detrimental new technology is allowed? Anyway, 
anyone? Do we have a case to stop it? Has anyone tried? 
 
(Comment: 5G is the microwave frequency and is commonplace in Shenzen etc plus 
facial recognition, drone surveillance and social credit and identity and yet no 
western government questions it, have all of them been compromised ? )  

 
I am not sure how they all got compromised. I think they were blinded by being given 
that huge technology budget to manage but I'm appalled that the greens didn't push 
for one independent study on 5G (or look at someone else's). What a hideous 
legacy.  
 
So I did four things, all quite telling.  
 
1) I appealed to TDs early with all the research I had and I got one reply. One 
sentence: WHO says it's safe. Bill Gates of Microsoft Technology, is the WHO's 
biggest funder.  
 
2) The public tender to run the National Biodiversity Data Centre came up this time 
last year, for €450,00. I went for it with business partners, including a national 
training school, prepared to roll out citizen science training to engage every college, 
community and farm in monitoring biodiversity before and after the 5G infrastructure 
went in. We also committed to monitoring the protected areas which Ireland is being 
fined for (every day) since we failed to protect them since 1992 when they were 
designated. We also committed to assembling a forum of doctoral researchers to 
interrogate the data from their various disciplines, so that the centre could support 
community actions to protect nature against big industry. We also proposed to create 
an information management system so that green deal money could be drawn down 
from the EU on the basis of positive climate action results evidenced by the data 
centre. Suffice to say the 'infomatics' guy got it who has been keeping it tipping along 
the last four years, absolutely no use to anyone.  
 
3) I went for the tender to train local councils in Climate Action and how to implement 
their Climate Action Charter. Didn't get that either.  
 
4) Every time I raise a valid question about EMF or 5G or anything else, I am told to 
make myself a tinfoil hat to protect myself and I might well go that way! But to roll out 
blatantly damaging technology like that is criminal I think and I'm having a hard time 
forgiving them.  
 
5) I saved the worst news until last. Valentia Island has 350 hubs on it. I couldn't find 
one of them. When I read about the different companies who rolled out the rural 
broadband there last year, I can't work out if they are saying it is fibre-less 
broadband or they are using fibre. If they are not, that is pure wifi of the 5G kind. I 
also can't work out if it is still beaming away, even when few people actually have 
devices/routers that can receive 5G. Kind of what strength it is and impact on 
biodiversity and birds and people even before it's used? Do anyone know?

Serving Notice (3) of Personal Liability to WMP, SCF, WHO, WEF and UN and all 
their agents. 
Attached above as the 3rd Notice served. 
 

13th March 2024 
Assigning personal Liability for the Erection of 5G masts without planning 
permission, liability or safety studies 
Dear Candida, 
Please pass this notice to Stefan Gawrysiak, Alexandrine Kantor, Jo Robb, Leigh 
Rawlins, Ed Sadler, Katherine Foxhall, Andy Cooke, Ron Batstone, Judy Roberts, 
and Andrew Skinner. 
 
As a member of the two groups mentioned below, it has come to my attention that 
the County Councillors are personally liable for the decisions made locally, whereas 
MPs and courts are somehow indemnified. The significance of this was amplified 
when I sent the notice below and have only had an email to clarify my postcode, 
rather than a proper response. 
 
The thing is we do not consent to the erecting of new wifi masts, the large or the 
small variety, both of which emit a military-grade radiation. For the last few weeks 
myself and several friends have experienced an extraordinarily pronounced 
degradation in vision, burning headaches and a wide range of degenerative health 
conditions. I gather they are intended to interact with the internet of things, smart 
infrastructure and even biological nano technology. Did these masts come before 
your panel for scrutiny? Were you able to access the extensive research showing the 
new networks to be extremely dangerous to health? Have you heard of all the court 
cases exhaustively demonstrating that the implementers of the Health and Climate 
measures and funds are only creating a captured market for themselves and 
deliberately overlooking the Nuremburg Code and even accused of genocide for the 
genetically engineered injections forced on so many in this area, and around the 
world?  How can the company that has signed off on the safety studies and agreed 
liable have been dissolved 8 years ago?  
 
Can you review what the Scrutiny Committee discussed in regard to the incoming 
technologies, fluoride, restrictions, the new level of government to introduce other 
unregulated, unlawful programs, with no public consultation and yet full use of the 
public money? We would really appreciate it and hope that you are still working on 
our behalf. 
 
Best wishes,     .

Asking elected MPs to consider the Sex Matters Bill  
 
The Biotech and warping public narrative is intended to sterilise the children. 
I am involved in two active groups, Abingdon Peace Group and a human rights 
group, with expertise in Common Law. Please support the Bill forbidding the social 
transitioning in school of children from boys to girls and girls to boys. The Bill 
thankfully further demands that no child is given puberty blockers or hormonal 
treatment (irreversible or otherwise-promoted) or surgery to change their sex. You 
can support the Bill by joining the debate tomorrow. I have also sent this to the 
Mayor of Abingdon, a member of Mayors for Peace. This is because the  sterilzing of 
children, by a foreign entity, however it is achieved, is a crime. 
(https://infertilitymovie.org/ This is how they're doing it in Africa. 

 
Social and Genetic Engineering 
Allowing the social and genetic engineering of children is part of a wider war against 
men and women. Many children experience mortification and shame about their 
bodies and question the value of who they are, as they are, when they go through 
puberty and beyond. That is an emotional and mental response to failures of our 
education and society. We would go as far as to say that they were not even failures, 
but a premeditated and protracted attack on humanity, deployed by foreign and 
novel technologies. Please explain at the debate that it is a crime to exploit this 
vulnerable age group by validating the self-rejection of the healthy body they are 
born with. As Elon Musk said “Teach people to hate themselves and their history and 
they will be susceptible to any mind viruses.

Preparing the Case to end the Central Banking System and WEF - Richard C Cook 
The world economy, particularly in the US, Europe, and other parts of the West, has 
reached the point of catastrophe. This is due to the longstanding existence of a 
financial system based on exploitation, debt, and usury. Western banks are in 
terrible shape because the underlying producing economy can no longer afford to 
sustain the debt overhang. One consequence is that a big part of banking assets 
consists of money laundering from drug and weapons trafficking.

27th March 2024 
Speech for Dr Widya World Council For Health Voting to Reject The WHO 
Thank you for this opportunity to add the weight and gravitas of Indonesia’s doctors 
to this vote to stop the World Health Organization. Without further ado, I am Dr. 
Widya Murni, representing Indonesia & Country Council Indonesia. The WHO’s 
declaration and handling of the Covid 19 plandemic had a detrimental impact to our 
physical, emotional, mental wellbeing, economy, and democratic constitution that we 
are yet to recover from. 
Indisputably, the mandated lockdowns, masks and experimental vaccines constitute 
significant unlawful abuses of power by the authorities. The Amendments to the 
International Health Regulations and the proposed Treaty show that the WHO has 
no intention of returning our sovereignty or constitution, the Undang - Undang Dasar 
(UUD) 1945. 
 
During the pandemic, the threats and discrimination against Indonesian people were 
particularly harsh, with no financial or food provision made, despite the receipt of a 
pandemic fund. Even for many health practitioners like myself who are passionate in 
providing healthcare to our patients. All this by the restrictive order and direction from 
WHO. 
 
They have continued with experimental vector and vaccine programs but the lack of 
public consultation has woken up Indonesia to the fact that WHO are clearly 
contravening the Nuremburg Code and some are already arguing Genocide in the 

International Criminal Courts, with thousands of cases and pages of evidence being 
submitted. 
 
 Indonesia is committed to there not being another false declaration of world 
pandemic and all the harm that would follow. To make sure this is not allowed to 
happen again in the future, the World Health Organization and representatives in 
member states must be held to account by law. 
Most importantly WHO does not possess the same values, ethics and mission of a 
health authority but just acts as a business outlet to rule. We, therefore, will stress 
the importance of liberating ourselves from foreign rulings whose interests are to 
benefit themselves, not the people and global community. We should not consent to 
any tyrannical health or surveillance compulsions or colonization of our human rights 
ever again.  
 
10th April 2024 
Appeal File For the Federal Supreme Court in Switzerland, delivered by hand. 
Further files lodged included 140 pages of evidence of contested authority or 
lawfulness by the WHO, WEF and UN. 
 Klaus Schwab, Jeremy Farrar et al vs Frances 
Supreme Federal Court Lausanne Switzerland 11th April 2024 
Procedure 
 A. Injunction against WHA Voting: WHO Treaty / IHR 2005 Amendments B. 
Prosecution for Terrorism and 
Violations of International Treaties 
 This case originated in hundreds of applications made against the World Health 
Organization and the defendants, filed (or binned, we’ll never know) over the last 
four years. I file this application to Appeal in the Federal Supreme Court, as I am 
contesting 
multiple cases that meet the following conditions: 
The court’s decision pertains to a Legislature: “ A deliberative assembly with the 
legal authority to make laws for a political entity such as a country, nation or city”. 
 
The Circumstances of the Case 
 In this case, de facto shadow directors of the WHO, United Nations, World 
Economic Forum, GAVI et al are already assuming legal authority to legislate for 194 
United Nations Member States, despite over 160 of the member states having 
formally contested their authority and submitted evidence of crimes by these 
organizations, of genocide, terrorism, torture, experimentation without consent, 
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, conflicts of interest, 
artificial intelligence and other wireless technology with a military, retaliatory protocol, 
fraudulent misrepresentation as health and climate crises, protracted enslavement of 
people and animals, and posing an existential threat with genetic engineering and 
the patenting of information which it is critical should be in the public domain. These 
are all charges for which the men and women at the conference of the parties are yet 
to answer, and which are all in violation of existing International Treaties. 
 
 At the end of May 2024 the World Health Assembly intend to meet and pretend that 
there is consensus to adopt Amendments to the International Health Amendments, 
the WHO’s Pandemic Preparedness, Prevention and Response Treaty, the 
continued fraudulent extraction of wealth from nations, and men and women, in 

payment of alleged debt. 
 The appeal meets the condition that it is “a point of general public importance and it 
relates wholly or mainly to the construction of an enactment 
 or of a statutory instrument”. 
  
I am making this appeal on behalf of all men and women of all nations and regarding 
all the notices, formal statements, letters, and legal proceedings as cases that have 
been neither acknowledged nor replied to, which shows that there is no consensus. 
Unelected officials of the international organizations based in Geneva are seen as 
criminals, who believe they have diplomatic immunity. By filing this Statement of 
Claim, I request that personal liability is assigned by the law of your court, and all 
assets, Pandemic Funds, and other monies and property are seized and returned to 
the people by way of public banks. As this decision should mark the end of usury, all 
property and territories should pass to the full ownership and other bonds made on 
each life returned to the people. This men and women who should be stewards of 
this process are ready. 
 
   
 Application to the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland. I understand that “a 
‘leapfrog’ appeal can be permitted if the judge in the High Court certifies 
(immediately after judgment or on an application within 14 days) that the “relevant 
conditions” are satisfied, that a sufficient case has been made out to justify an 
application for permission to appeal to The Supreme Court” 
Application for a ‘leapfrog’ appeal should be permitted in this instance, I believe, as 
the application is within 14 days of my last personal liability notice to the defendants 
and there is the urgency of the upcoming World Health Assembly. I hope that 
submitting evidence from so many member states desperate to stop the defendants 
before unrecoverable damage is done, that a sufficient case has been made to 
justify an application for permission to appeal to the Supreme Court. 
1. This honourable court’s jurisdiction is chosen in accordance with international law 
and is sought due to 
 serious charges such as crimes against humanity, inter alia. 
 2. As we are under pressure time-wise, given the impending World Health Assembly 
in May 2024, I am seeking a summary judgment in an expedited manner 
without trial. 
 3. Original criminal charges and civil claims were filed in Indonesia, attached. The 
fee schedule and remedy to this case involve the immediate arrest of the other 
 parties. 
 4. The addresses of the defendants cannot be established and the court’s 
assistance will be required herein as we are seeking an urgent interim interdict/ 
injunction. 
 5. The defendants’ participation in international organizations does not provide 
immunity where ongoing crimes and commercial activity are involved. 
 I understand that Swiss civil procedure law is strongly oriented towards written 
procedure, and this is particularly true in appeal proceedings. I also understand that 
an Appeal would usually only look at how the law was applied in earlier cases, and 
not the claims of the case. The exception in this case is Manifest arbitrariness, where 
1) Decisions were made capriciously, irrationally and/or without determining 
principle. I refer to the decisions made by the defendants to not even acknowledge 
official correspondence from member states. This can be the only reason why earlier 

proceedings in civil, administrative and criminal contexts have been ignored. 2. The 
legislature fails to make a classification by recognizing the degrees of harm - or 
accepting liability for any harm 3. The purpose is not in consonance with 
constitutional values - national and personal sovereignty and freedoms are values 
that 
are under direct threat. 
 
Because the decision-making process and the “decisions were based on irrelevant 
facts, while ignoring relevant considerations, such actions reflect “arbitrariness”. This 
is why I ask Switzerland to retain international jurisdiction to examine the merits of 
the case. 
 
Appellant 
 I acknowledge your admissibility clause that an “Appellant must have participated in 
the proceedings before the previous instance, or not have been given the opportunity 
to participate and show to be particularly affected by the appealed decision and have 
an interest worthy of protection in its annulment 
or amendment.” 
 Participation: Notices to the defendants of 1) Conditional Acceptance Pending Due 
Diligence, 2) Cease and Desist Military Retaliatory Protocols, 3) Personal Liability 
and Intention to Prosecute are attached. Plus 25 counts of criminal charges, and civil 
claims made by other member states, and those we 
filed in Indonesia are attached. 
Opportunity to participate: “or not have been given the opportunity to participate” 
relates to all the attached cases. This is of legal relevance because the United 
Nations and the World Health Organization have provided no opportunity to 
participate. The has been no due process, and no recourse to address reservations, 
whether they are immediate or planned. It has been impossible to bring criminal 
charges or even record a personal adverse event following a vaccine. Whether it is 
to a court, or police station, public representative or to inquire about liability, or 
create an avenue or forum for informed consent or rebuttal. This is due to censorship 
and often a flatdenial of any question raised. 
  
   All the attached cases required a significant amount of courage and clarity to 
complete. Many have had to leave their jobs to avoid complicity. Even inter- 
governmental negotiations and challenges have been dismissed by the WHO as 
misinformation. 
 That is the main reason I am making this appeal. To make the work, losses, conflict 
and struggle for agency, which humanity has experienced, actually count and go on 
record as making history, in the Law library of the Supreme Federal Court. 
 The resistance that concerned experts have met, justifies the claim that the WHO, 
WMP, BRIN, DARPA et al, do not want to monitor or regulate the safety and efficacy 
of its recommendations, or share its research findings in the public. The coercion has 
been 
widespread. 
 
I am an international ambassador of peace and de jure woman: frances. I am the 
authorised representative of the corporate entity Frances Micklem. As part of the 
Indonesian leadership group Gladiator Bangsa, I participated in the criminal 
proceedings against Save The Children Fund and World Mosquito Program, and the 

civil proceedings against the Health Minister of Indonesia. I confirm that the 
appellants, in all the cases attached, were not given the opportunity for a hearing, 
and many lost their lives and livelihoods in the process. 
 I also confirm that I am “particularly affected by the appealed decision as everyone 
is relying on me to get this appeal before your honourable court, provide you with the 
precedents you need, and witnesses, to stop the defendants’ self-promotion to a one 
world government and becoming international law-makers. Their sphere of influence 
and resources must be reduced to nil. The defendants must not have the power to 
engineer the pathogens, call a pandemic, implement lockdowns or other measure, or 
mandate their own patented vaccines, or the deployment of engineered vectors or 
vaccines, they have a financial interest in. They must be arrested and the 
organizations dismantled. 
 All life on the planet; people, places and animals will be affected and we all have an 
interest worthy of 
protection, in your annulment or amendment.

  There had been no operational or financial due diligence done. Permissions and 
exemptions from regulation are usually granted, following fraudulent 
claims of benefits and bribery. 
 The defendants are all de facto shadow directors. For a definition of a shadow 
director: “On a regular basis and over a period time, the majority of the directors of 
these organizations must perform positive acts in accordance with the alleged 
shadow director's instructions. If that test is met, the person is likely to be found to be 
a shadow director”. This will inevitably include Anthony Fauci as the man who 
assigns funding for medical research and other research within 
and beyond third level education. 
In time: 
 
 This Appeal has been made in time 
1) as the defendants have been given every opportunity to respond 2) There is no 
ambiguity in the 25 earlier instances, attached: The covid vaccines, masks, 
lockdowns, PCR tests, IHR Amendments and Political Declaration were all formally 
rejected in time in a myriad of formats. However, not one reservation, rejection, 
withdrawal or other written notice has been acknowledged by the defendants. The 
date for voting on the IHR Amendments and Treaty runs between the 
1st April and the 26th May 2024. 
  This appeal is urgent but it is in time to stop the contravening of the WHO’s own 
Constitution, the WEF’s own Manifesto and the UN’s own Charter, by a small 
conference of the parties pushing these treaties through. Finally, I wrote to the court 
in time - before 
the Treaty on the 5th 
 April - alerting the court to the dire threat, to the jurisdiction for men and women, that 
the proposed treaty posed. Therefore, if that Treaty was passed, however 
illegitimately, I still entered this application for 
an appeal before my jurisdiction came into question. 
 I reiterate here that Articificial Intelligence must be stopped as, due to that treaty. 
Whether it passed or not, AI will already have been programmed to recognise the 
claim to being a biological man or woman as a possible crime against humanity. 
Such is the extent of the madness that we have been enduring. In addition the AI will 
be connecting the Decision of the Supreme Court in America that the 
vaccinated are no longer human but ‘trans human’. 
 
  Cost 

 I would like to enquire as to the cost of this appeal, as it is a public interest case 
brought by one individual, 
spanning criminal, administrative, civil and patent law. 
I note that “the decisions of the last cantonal instance and the Federal Patent Court 
can be appealed before the Federal Supreme Court (article 72 of the FCA). The 
appeal in civil matters before the Federal Supreme Court is subject to certain 
conditions. Generally, a minimum value of the claim is required (15,000 Swiss francs 
in employment and tenancy law cases; 30,000 Swiss francs in any other cases). I 
hope that “this minimum value of the claim is not required. Although the value of the 
claim is indeed infinite, if we can reinstate our standing as beneficiaries in our own 
lives, create peace and safety, in every nation and reclaim our freedom and 
dignity, and that of our fellow animals. 
 Furthermore, another condition is met: 
Can the costs of this Appeal be waived as it is in the 
 • The Federal Supreme Court may accept that a 
fundamental point of law is at stake. 
• The settlement will be a return of the monies extracted through fraudulent debt 
collection, both 
national and individual. 
 The connection of these two legislative developments could remove the jurisdiction 
of all people and place it below governments and corporations - One of the cases I 
attach is the resignation letter of the UN Human Rights Commissioner, on this 
matter, where 
no one is afforded human rights. 
 
 public interest? 
 I am appealing before the Federal Supreme Court, against the decision by the UN to 
empower themselves, through the WHO as legislators of International Law. This 
must take place before the 
World Health Assembly at the end of May 2024. 
We enclose earlier cases that would bring peace for 
definite, if the 
instances were counted and collectively 
succeed in prosecuting the defendants. This is a chance to return the course of 
history to the conscious 
evolution we should all be enjoying at the moment. 
We’re appealing against the decision by the defendants to empower themselves, as 
legislators of International Law and claiming they are acting with 
intent to harm.

   We are relying on the honourable Court to hold the Geneva-based defendants 
accountable for deploying bioweapons and using patent laws to protect dual use 
research and thereby preventing independent testing or risk assessment of 
engineered products. I hope that this case will then become the precedent so that 
parallel agencies and corporations around the world, still perpetuating crimes against 
humanity, can be 
successfully challenged. 
 In an attempt to sidestep the serious reservations, the WHO responded by entering 
an additional Article into 
the proposed Treaty that reads: ‘No 
observations will be permitted’. A cursory look at any other International Treaties 
show that observations make up the most important instrument of sovereign states 
granting exemptions from adhering to parts of an agreement that are not in 
alignment with their constitution. The defendants are not in alignment with 
human values and we do not consent. 
 We have precedents and law ready. There are many groups of lawyers and doctors 
who would be grateful to support this appeal and find out their efforts have not gone 
to waste. However, I believe their time would 
and their corporate entities are our only chances at creating peace and mutual 
respect, with land healthy enough for subsistence with organic measures and not 
one bi lab, or child down a mine to supply components for batteries. And not one 
solar panel on land that could be productive, and when roof space is 
available. 
 
 be much better spent if they were given new responsibilities and opportunities to 
guide people in 
 taking responsibility for their own health. 
 I made a commitment to myself twenty five years ago that I would end animal 
suffering and wake people up from the cognitive dissonance around loving animals 
on the one hand and still allowing them to live absolutely unendurable lives, on the 
other. Later, I made a commitment to my father - who was a High Court judge and 
who wrote some of the Unfair Dismissal law and many books, reflecting on what 
makes a life worth living that I would stop the production of agricultural chemicals 
and patenting of seeds. It never occurred to me that it would be our lives and our 
freedom that are gone. Surveillance; microchip implants; the theft, pooling and 
corruption of our blood and water. The deployment of diseased organisms into us, 
using mosquitoes and forced medical procedures. And the wild megalomania of 
genetic engineering, spending public money on the research and then patenting the 
results. And building nuclear submarines and modular reactors and telling us they’re 

green, and economical and a deterrent. And the realisation that we’re each running 
up fraudulent, but still insurmountable, debts while funding the whole lot. I mean 
really, the audacity of the defendants and the passive aggression of their ignorance 
and their deadly agenda. They have given themselves away though now and I am so 
grateful to have an 11th-hour opportunity to lodge this appeal. My grandfather was 
recognised for his contribution to the arts as a 
Companion of Honour; a medal that reads “In action faithful and In honour clear”. 
Please honour the people in your decision, and suspend the IHR Amendments and

immediately and permanently. Thank you.

No. 00492 
H.E. Mr. Dennis Francis 
President, General Assembly United Nations 
New York.- 
Distinguished President of the General Assembly, 
New York, 17 September 2023 
 
We have the honor to address you, in our capacity as representatives from the 
delegations of Belarus, Bolivia, Cuba, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, 
Eritrea, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Nicaragua, the Russian Federation, the Syrian 
Arab Republic, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe, in relation to the unfortunate situation 
created around the draft political declarations of the SDG Summit, the High-level 
meeting on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response, the High-level 
meeting on universal health coverage, and the High-level meeting on the fight 
against tuberculosis. 
 
In this regard, it is regrettable that it has not been possible to find a political solution 
to the current stalemate, created, not only due to the lack of will of some developed 
countries to engage in true and meaningful negotiations to have balanced and 
acceptable outcomes for all, but also due to the lack of transparency and poor 
handling of your predecessor’s team of all these processes. 
 
As you are aware, the issue of the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures 
(UCMs) is an existential one for our peoples. A third of the world’s population is 
affected by these illegal measures. There is ample evidence, including from UN 
sources, of the heavy toll caused by UCMs on targeted countries’ capacities to 
achieve sustainable development and to make further progress in protecting the right 
to health of their respective populations. Regardless of these facts, we have 
engaged in the negotiations of these draft outcomes in good faith, with a spirit of 
compromise and a constructive approach, in order to reach consensus. 
 
Since the beginning of these processes, we have insisted on the need to include our 
concerns in these important political documents, on the basis of consensual 
language, as reflected in paragraph 30 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable 
Development. This request has been echoed by a large number of delegations, 
including from the Group of the 77 and China, and from the Group of Friends in 
Defense of the UN Charter, among others. 
    
Excellency, 
The legitimate concerns of a large number of developing countries have been 
ignored. Hence, it is our duty to express our strong concerns on the unacceptable 

way in which this situation unfolded, running in clear contradiction with the spirit of 
multilateralism and the overall goal of “leaving no one behind”. 
 
First, there has been no real willingness from a small group of developed countries 
to engage in meaningful negotiations to find compromises, forcing unfair practices 
which pretend to impose a kind of “veto” on certain issues, and pretending to even 
prevent their discussion within the framework of intergovernmental negotiations. 
Second, in some cases, negotiations were not conducted in a truly inclusive, fair and 
balanced way. Our delegations had to witness how, in some cases, even single 
delegations were accommodated a great deal in their concerns, while others’ 
priorities, including ours, were bluntly neglected. For example, the draft outcome of 
the High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development under the auspices of 
the General Assembly – SDGs Summit, was reopened with the purpose of 
exclusively accommodating the priorities of a few delegations from developed 
countries, while, in this very same process, and in the three (03) health-related 
negotiations, nothing was done to reflect and accommodate the legitimate concerns 
of delegations from developing countries that, in addition had broken silence 
repeatedly, including the Group of 77 and China. 
 
Third, the attempt to ignore formal communications of delegations from developing 
countries, including from the Group of 77 and China, on behalf of its 134 Member 
States, indicating strong reservations and objections. 
Fourth, the attempt to force consensus by your predecessor’s team, and now by your 
Office, when it is evident that no consensus has been reached on any of these 
processes; as well as the lack of transparency, inclusiveness and efficient use of the 
limited time available then to find compromises. 
Excellency, 
Our delegations are convinced that this is no way to handle multilateral and 
intergovernmental negotiations on issues of great relevance for the international 
community, particularly for developing countries. Thus, we would like to put on 
record that we do not condone, nor accept, this practice, and that it does not set any 
precedent for the work of the United Nations and its General Assembly. This is 
particularly relevant, as we look forward to future negotiation processes on 
fundamental matters, in which we will continue engaging with great determination, 
flexibility and constructiveness. 
 
Our delegations would also like to recall the nature and legal standing of the 
meetings in which the SDGs Summit, the High-Level Meeting on Pandemic 
Prevention, 
Preparedness and Response, the High-Level Meeting on Universal Health 
Coverage, and the High-Level Meeting on the Fight against Tuberculosis, will take 
place. 
In relation to the High-Level Political Forum (HLPF) on Sustainable Development 
under the auspices of the General Assembly, SDGs Summit, and in accordance with 
General Assembly resolution 67/290, in its operative paragraph 9, “all meetings 
convened under the auspices of the General Assembly shall operate under the rules 
of procedure of the main committees of the Assembly, as applicable, unless 
otherwise provided in the present resolution”. Also, operative paragraph 4 of that 
very same resolution clearly states that the Forum “shall result in a concise 
negotiated political declaration to be submitted for the consideration of the 

Assembly”. 
 
Hence, we expect a process to take place at a later stage, where the General 
Assembly will formally consider the adoption of the draft Political Declaration, under 
Chapter XII of the Rules of Procedures of the General Assembly. 
Similarly, General Assembly resolutions 75/315, 77/274 and 77/275, are clear in 
indicating that the political declarations of the three health-related High-Level 
Meetings should “be submitted by the President of the General Assembly for 
adoption by the Assembly”. 
 
In that sense, our delegations oppose any attempt to pretend to formally adopt any 
of the draft outcome documents in question, during the meetings scheduled for 18, 
20, 21 and 22 September 2023, respectively. In addition, we reserve the right to take 
appropriate action upon the formal consideration of these four (04) draft outcome 
documents in the coming weeks, after the conclusion of the High-Level Segment of 
the 78th Session of the General Assembly, when they must all be considered by the 
General Assembly in accordance with its rules of procedures. 
 
In that spirit and in the interest of transparency, we respectfully request hereby your 
good offices for circulating as soon as possible this letter as an official document of 
the General Assembly, under agenda items 19 and 127, entitled “Sustainable 
development” and “Global health and foreign policy”, respectively. 
We take this opportunity, Excellency, to reiterate to you the testimony of our highest 
and most distinguished consideration.

We reiterate our serious concern at continued attempts aimed at replacing the tenets 
enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations – which have been agreed upon by 
the entire international community for conducting their international relations – with a 

so-called “rules-based order”, that remains unclear, that has not been discussed or 
accepted by the wide UN membership, and that has the potential, among others, to 
undermine the rule of law at the international level. 
 
We concur that double-standards, coupled with selective approaches or 
accommodative interpretations of the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations, 
aimed at advancing political agendas of dubious nature, in clear contempt for 
international legality and in disregard for the common good or collective interests of 
the peoples of the United Nations, represent one of the major threats to the 
prevalence and validity of that universal and legally binding instrument that 
constitutes an exceptional achievement for humankind and a true act of faith on the 
best of humanity.” 
 
“statement during the first meeting of national coordinators of the group that was 
held in Tehran on Saturday. 
 
The text of the document is as follows: 
 
We, representatives of Algeria, Angola, Belarus, Bolivia, Cambodia, China, Cuba, 
the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Iran, the Lao 
People’s Democratic Republic, Nicaragua, the State of Palestine, the Russian 
Federation, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Syria, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe, in 
our respective capacities as National Coordinators of the Group of Friends in 
Defense of the Charter of the United Nations, met at the vice-ministerial level, in 
Tehran, Islamic Republic of Iran, in order to discuss ways and means to advance our 
common endeavors aimed at preserving, promoting and defending the prevalence 
and validity of the Charter of the United Nations, both in its letter and spirit, and to 
further improve our coordination on issues of common concern and interest and on 
potential ways to move forward. 
 
We recall the political declaration adopted on 22 September 2022, in New York, at 
the ministerial level, on the margins of the 77th Session of the General Assembly of 
the United Nations, and reaffirm once again our firm and full commitment to the 
Charter of the United Nations, including the purposes and principles contained 
therein, which represent the cornerstone for both preserving and promoting 
international peace and security, the rule of law, economic development and social 
progress, as well as human rights for all. 
We reiterate our serious concern at continued attempts aimed at replacing the tenets 
enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations – which have been agreed upon by 
the entire international community for conducting their international relations – with a 
so-called “rules-based order”, that remains unclear, that has not been discussed or 
accepted by the wide UN membership, and that has the potential, among others, to 
undermine the rule of law at the international level. 
We concur that double-standards, coupled with selective approaches or 
accommodative interpretations of the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations, 
aimed at advancing political agendas of dubious nature, in clear contempt for 
international legality and in disregard for the common good or collective interests of 
the peoples of the United Nations, represent one of the major threats to the 
prevalence and validity of that universal and legally binding instrument that 
constitutes an exceptional achievement for humankind and a true act of faith on the 

best of humanity. 
 
We call for the redoubling of efforts towards the democratization of international 
relations and the strengthening of multilateralism and of a multipolar system, based, 
among others, on mutual respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all 
States, as well as on respect for the principle of equal rights and self- determination 
of peoples, for the rule of law, diplomacy, political dialogue, tolerance, peaceful 
coexistence, respect for diversity, inclusiveness, a culture of peace and non-
violence, and due consideration for existing differences, all of which are essential for 
constructively and effectively working together on issues of common interest and 
concern. 
We reaffirm that the United Nations remains a central and indispensable forum for 
addressing and advancing issues relating to international cooperation for economic 
development and social progress, peace and security, peaceful settlement of 
disputes, human rights and the rule of law, on the basis of dialogue, cooperation and 
consensus-building approaches amongst States, and therefore remain fully 
committed to both its revitalization and the strengthening of its role, particularly at the 
current international juncture, in which the world needs much more solidarity and 
cooperation, as well as the diplomatic tools provided within its very own founding 
Charter. 
 
We recognize the multifaceted crisis the world is currently facing, particularly its 
environmental, food, energy, economic and finance dimensions, and emphasize that 
the solution to it passes through the urgent adoption of collective strategies and 
decisive measures that must necessarily be rooted on the purposes and principles of 
the Charter of the United Nations. In this regard, we call on the members of the 
international community to revive the spirt of unity, solidarity, cooperation, inclusivity, 
and mutual understanding that prevailed at the San Francisco Conference of 1945, 
which is needed today the most, in order to overcome threats and challenges that 
are common to us all alike, especially in the fields of peace, security and 
development. 
We express our concern at the potential impact of ongoing geopolitical tensions on 
the current global multifaceted crisis, and, therefore, call for the respect to the 
sovereignty and independence of States, while rejecting any attempt at entrenching 
a Cold War-era mentality that is based on confrontation, the deepening of divisions 
and the imposition of disparate visions and agendas, in an attempt to divide our 
world into blocs. We highlight, in this context, the importance of respecting the 
decisions of States to abstain from participating in and to remain impartial to conflicts 
of any sort, in procurement of the best interests of their peoples, confident that such 
an approach shall, in turn, continue to play an important role in the development of 
peaceful, friendly and mutually beneficial relations between the countries of the 
world, as well as in the strengthening of a multilateral system in which diversity is 
both embraced and respected, while stressing the importance of ensuring that 
developing countries do not become a new field for geostrategic competition 
amongst major players. 
 
We call on the Secretariat of the United Nations to strictly adhere to the founding 
Charter of the Organization, in particular the provisions of Article 100, in the 
performance of its duties, in accordance with their respective mandate, including 
when implementing General Assembly and Security Council resolutions. 

We acknowledge that humanity lives in an indivisible security community in which 
one nation’s security is indivisible from the common security of a given region and 
that of the international community as a whole, and that therefore no State can seek 
its own security at the cost of the security of another State or group of States. We 
consider, thus, that efforts shall be made towards the promotion of diplomatic 
endeavors aimed at establishing a fair, equal, sustainable, inclusive and indivisible 
global security architecture, taking into account the legitimate security concerns of all 
countries, with a view to preventing the emergence of conflict or crisis situations that 
may put at risk global peace, security, stability and humankind. 
We express our categorical rejection of all unilateral coercive measures, including 
those applied as tools for political or economic and financial pressure against any 
country, in particular against developing countries. We further express our serious 
concern at the continued imposition and expansion of such measures, which, among 
others, hinder the wellbeing of targeted populations, create obstacles to the full 
realization of their human rights, including their right to development, jeopardize 
international cooperation on aviation safety, and exacerbate global food insecurity, 
particularly at the current juncture, in which we face a multifaceted global crisis, with 
multiple dimensions, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We reiterate 
our unwavering support and solidarity with nations and peoples subjected to 
unilateral and arbitrary approaches that violate both the purposes and principles 
enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and the basic norms of international 
law, especially those that are part of our Group of Friends, and further renew our call 
for both their complete, immediate and unconditional lifting. 
We, in accordance with international law, support any claim of States affected by 
unilateral coercive measures, including the targeted States, to compensation for the 
damage incurred as a consequence of the implementation and extraterritorial 
implications of such measures. 
 
We express our unwavering support for and solidarity with the People and 
Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, subjected to unilateral coercive 
measures, including unilateral sanctions imposed by certain countries, which violate 
the Charter of the United Nations and the rules and principles of international law, 
while seriously threatening the full enjoyment of their human rights and the 
realization of their right to development. We further call for the “lifting of all such 
unilateral measures against the Islamic Republic of Iran, Iranian nationals and 
companies”, as recommended by the UN Special Rapporteur on the Negative Impact 
of Unilateral Coercive Measures on the Enjoyment of Human Rights in her report to 
the Human Rights Council on 17 August 2022 (A/HRC/51/33/Add.1), pursuant to her 
official country visit to the Islamic Republic of Iran from 07 through 18 May 2022. 
 
We, in line with our historic and principled positions, express our unwavering 
solidarity with the people and government of the Republic of Cuba, which has 
heroically endured the negative impact of the economic, commercial and financial 
blockade imposed on it by the United States for over sixty years, representing the 
single major impediment for its full economic and social development, and urge the 
government of the United States to immediately and unconditionally put an end to 
the blockade against Cuba. In this context, we welcome the resolution just adopted 
by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 03 November 2022, demanding, 
for the 30th consecutive occasion, the necessity of ending the blockade imposed by 
the United States against Cuba. 

We renew the concerns previously raised in connection with the lack of compliance 
with the “Agreement between the United Nations and the United States of America 
regarding the Headquarters of the United Nations”, both in its letter and spirit, 
particularly with regards to the delays and/or denials of issuance and/or renewal of 
visas, travel and movement restrictions, banking issues and breaches of inviolability 
of diplomatic properties, and stress that the privilege of hosting the Headquarters of 
the United Nations shall not be abused and that bilateral differences shall not be 
exploited within the context of the implementation of relevant international legally 
binding obligations. 
 
We express our serious concern at the continued proliferation of disinformation in 
digital platforms, including on social media, which are created, disseminated and 
amplified by both State and non-State actors for political, ideological or commercial 
motivations at an alarmingly growing scale. We stress that such trends not only 
undermine national sovereignty, in violation of Charter of the United Nations, but also 
provoke manifestations of hate speech, racism, xenophobia, stigmatization, while 
inciting all forms of violence, intolerance, discrimination and hostility. We emphasize, 
in this regard, the responsibility of all States in countering this trend, including the 
misuse of information and communication technology resources. 
We, in line with our principled and historic positions, reaffirm our firm commitment to 
the just cause of Palestine, as well as our unwavering solidarity with the heroic 
Palestinian people in their ongoing struggle to achieve their inalienable rights, 
freedom and justice. We further reaffirm our full and continued support to all efforts 
aimed at ending the grave injustice inflicted on the Palestinian people since the 1948 
Nakba. We also remain committed to strengthening our efforts, including active 
engagement in international initiatives, aimed at ending the Israeli occupation, which 
constitutes an illegal colonial occupation and apartheid regime, and at achieving the 
independence of the State of Palestine, with East Jerusalem as its capital; the 
realization of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, including to self-
determination and freedom; and a just and lasting solution to the Question of 
Palestine in all its aspects, including for the plight of the Palestine refugees, in 
accordance with international law, the relevant UN resolutions and the Charter of the 
United Nations. We further reaffirm our support for the long-overdue admission of the 
State of Palestine as a full Member State of the United Nations, which has been 
pending before the Security Council since 23 September 2011, and to enable it to 
take its rightful place among the community of nations. 
 
We recognize that, since its establishment over a year ago, the Group of Friends in 
Defense of the Charter of the United Nations has made significant progress in 
advancing its objectives and in implementing its annual Programme of Work and, in 
this context, express our appreciation to the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela for its 
leadership and coordination efforts. In this regard, we reiterate our determination to 
redouble efforts aimed at positioning our Group of Friends as an active and key 
player at all relevant international forums and intergovernmental processes, including 
in the context of the General Assembly of the United Nations during its 77th Session, 
as part of our continued endeavors for ensuring full respect of and adherence to the 
Charter of the United Nations, in both its letter and spirit. 
 
We reiterate our invitation to those members of the international community that are 
committed to the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United 

Nations, with the values of dialogue, tolerance and solidarity, as well as to an 
effective and inclusive multilateralism, in which all regions and all size of States are 
equal and engaged alike, to consider joining our Group of Friends and/or endorsing 
this and previous Political Declarations at their earliest convenience, as part of our 
collective efforts to advance our shared objectives and to ultimately keep delivering 
on the promise of the Charter of the United Nations for a more peaceful and 
prosperous world in which no one is left behind. 
We also reaffirm our strong rejection and condemnation of the imposition of illegal 
sanctions, unilateral coercive measures against the People and Government of 
Nicaragua, and aggressions that have a negative impact on the development and 
prosperity of the country. In this sense, we demand the immediate end of such 
sanctions. 
 
We express our serious concern at the current and growing threats against the 
Charter of the United Nations, including the implementation of practices that 
contribute in no way to addressing, through peaceful means and cooperation, the 
complex, emerging and common challenges faced these days by humanity. Instead, 
they contribute to an increase in uncertainty, instability and tensions around the 
world. 
We express our grave concern at the instrumentalization of the United Nations, in 
particular the Security Council, by certain states, to meddle in the internal affairs of a 
sovereign and full Member State of our Organization, the Islamic Republic of Iran, in 
violation of the Charter of the United Nations. 
 
We express our appreciation and gratitude to the People and Government of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran for the excellent organization, hospitality, and hosting of the 
First Meeting of National Coordinators of the Group of Friends in the Defense of the 
Charter of the United Nations, on 05 November 2022, in Tehran. 
We, at last, renew our firm determination to continue defending the Charter of the 
United Nations through concerted actions from the Group of Friends in Defense of 
the Charter of the United Nations and to stand by one another in this noble 
endeavor. 
Tehran, 05 November 2022 
 
 
3) G77 serious reservations about Treaty ignored . Galtung’s characterization of the 
system: (1) Interaction between Center (metropole) and Periphery (colonized 
country) is vertical (2) Interaction between Periphery and Periphery is missing (3) 
Multilateral interaction involving all three is missing (4) Interaction with the outside 
world is monopolized by Center (5) Center as well as Periphery interaction with 
Periphery nations belonging to other Center nations is missing (Galtung 1971: 89)  
Galtung perceived his rules of interaction as applying not only to economic

Journal of the Group of 77 - Volume 19/1 (2007) (Spring Edition)  
G77 AND NAM FAULT ONE-SIZE-FITS-ALL APPROACH TO DEVELOPMENT 
 

UNITED NATIONS, (G77/IPS) - The Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) and the Group 
of 77 (G77), the two largest political and economic groups of developing nations, 
have expressed reservations on a proposed plan to restructure the U.N.’s 
operational activities for social and economic development. 
 
In a letter to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, both groups have cautioned him 
against rushing into any hasty decision leading to the implementation of the 
proposed plan, which includes a single, unified approach to all U.N. development 
activities in the field. 
 
“There is no one-size-fits-all (approach),” the joint letter said, warning that there 
should be no restrictions on the ability and sovereignty of national governments to 
determine their own development priorities or select their own development partners. 
 
The letter was a strong reaction to a report by a blue-ribbon panel of current and 
former world leaders who have called for “a unified United Nations” at the country 
level — with one leader, one programme, one budget, and where appropriate, one 
office. 
 
Titled the “High-Level Panel on U.N. System-Wide Coherence”, the 15-member 
panel released a study last November called “Delivering as One” that focused on 
three areas: development, humanitarian assistance and the environment. 
 
The ultimate aim of the “One-UN” initiative is to reduce duplication and transaction 
costs so that the United Nations can use resources more effectively to support 
partner countries to achieve their development goals, according to the panel. 
 
While conceding there are “a number of useful recommendations on the report we 
can build on”, the NAM/G77 letter warns that the study may have mistakenly touched 
on “cross cutting issues” — such as human rights, gender and sustainable 
development — as part of U.N. operational activities for development. 
 
While cross-cutting issues are not confined only to developing countries, the letter 
says that both the G77 and NAM are concerned “that those issues, as well as 
humanitarian assistance, might be misused to introduce new conditionalities on 
international development assistance, which is not acceptable to developing 
countries.” 
 
Both groups have met the secretary-general and briefed him in greater detail. 
 
Among the other recommendations in the report are: a Sustainable Development 
Board to oversee the One-UN Country programmes; a new panel consisting of the 
U.N. Secretary-General, the president of the World Bank and the Executive Director 
of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to review, update and conclude formal 
agreements on their respective roles and relations at the global and country levels. 
 
As part of the “One-U.N.” programme, eight countries have volunteered to be guinea 
pigs in an experimental exercise meant to reduce duplication and to use resources 
more effectively. 
 

The programme, which is currently being implemented, will be evaluated over the 
next 12 months for possible inclusion of additional countries willing to join it. 
 
The eight pilot countries — Albania, Cape Verde, Mozambique, Pakistan, Rwanda, 
Tanzania, Uruguay and Vietnam — will provide case studies as to how the U.N. 
family can deliver in a more coordinated manner by pooling funds at the country 
level. 
 
The G77 and NAM are sceptical of the One-UN approach to operational activities for 
development. 
 
“The U.N. development system should continue to support development efforts of 
developing countries principally by assisting in the implementation of nationally 
determined development plans, strategies and priorities,” the letter said. 
 
Jens Stoltenberg, prime minister of Norway and one of the co-chairs of the panel, 
told a U.N. press conference last November that the United Nations could save up to 
20 percent of its current costs system-wide by eliminating duplication and 
consolidating certain funds and programmes. 
 
“The whole idea is not to save money for donor countries, but to save money so we 
can use more money for development, more money for protecting the environment 
and more money for humanitarian assistance,” he added. 
 
But despite the good intentions of the panel, the successful implementation of its 
proposals will depend largely on whether or not it receives the necessary support 
from developing countries, comprising over two-thirds of the 192-member General 
Assembly and who represent all the members of both NAM and the G77. 
 
The letter to the secretary-general also points out that coherence at the national and 
international level should also involve the Bretton Woods institutions, namely the 
World Bank and the IMF, where they exist. 
 
“They should be part of any integrated approach to development cooperation. 
Bilateral development partners should also be part and parcel of this approach,” it 
said. 
 
4) Urgent Open Letter from Doctors and Scientists to the European Medicines 
Agency Regarding COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Concerns 
 
Emer Cooke 
Executive Director 
European Medicines Agency 
Amsterdam 
The Netherlands 
 
28 February 2021 
 
Dear Sirs/Mesdames, 
 

FOR THE URGENT PERSONAL ATTENTION OF: 
EMER COOKE 
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE EUROPEAN MEDICINES AGENCY 
 
BY EMAIL ONLY 
 
As physicians and scientists, we are supportive in principle of the use of new medical 
interventions which are appropriately developed and deployed, having obtained 
informed consent from the patient. This stance encompasses vaccines in the same 
way as therapeutics.  
 
We note that a wide range of side effects is being reported following vaccination of 
previously healthy younger individuals with the gene-based COVID-19 vaccines. 
Moreover, there have been numerous media reports from around the world of care 
homes being struck by COVID-19 within days of vaccination of residents. While we 
recognise that these occurrences might, every one of them, have been unfortunate 
coincidences, we are concerned that there has been and there continues to be 
inadequate scrutiny of the possible causes of illness or death under these 
circumstances, and especially so in the absence of post-mortems examinations. 
 
In particular, we question whether cardinal issues regarding the safety of the 
vaccines were adequately addressed prior to their approval by the European 
Medicines Agency (EMA). 
 
As a matter of great urgency, we herewith request that the EMA provide us with 
responses to the following issues: 
 
1. Following intramuscular injection, it must be expected that the gene-based 
vaccines will reach the bloodstream and disseminate throughout the body [1]. We 
request evidence that this possibility was excluded in pre-clinical animal models with 
all three vaccines prior to their approval for use in humans by the EMA.  
 
2. If such evidence is not available, it must be expected that the vaccines will remain 
entrapped in the circulation and be taken up by endothelial cells. There is reason to 
assume that this will happen particularly at sites of slow blood flow, i.e. in small 
vessels and capillaries [2]. We request evidence that this probability was excluded in 
pre-clinical animal models with all three vaccines prior to their approval for use in 
humans by the EMA.  
 
3. If such evidence is not available, it must be expected that during expression of the 
vaccines’ nucleic acids, peptides derived from the spike protein will be presented via 
the MHC I - pathway at the luminal surface of the cells. Many healthy individuals 
have CD8-lymphocytes that recognize such peptides, which may be due to prior 
COVID infection, but also to cross-reactions with other types of Coronavirus [3; 4] 
[5]. We must assume that these lymphocytes will mount an attack on the respective 
cells. We request evidence that this probability was excluded in pre-clinical animal 
models with all three vaccines prior to their approval for use in humans by the EMA.  
 
4. If such evidence is not available, it must be expected that endothelial damage with 
subsequent triggering of blood coagulation via platelet activation will ensue at 

countless sites throughout the body. We request evidence that this probability was 
excluded in pre-clinical animal models with all three vaccines prior to their approval 
for use in humans by the EMA.  
 
5. If such evidence is not available, it must be expected that this will lead to a drop in 
platelet counts, appearance of D-dimers in the blood, and to myriad ischaemic 
lesions throughout the body including in the brain, spinal cord and heart. Bleeding 
disorders might occur in the wake of this novel type of DIC-syndrome including, 
amongst other possibilities, profuse bleedings and haemorrhagic stroke. We request 
evidence that all these possibilities were excluded in pre-clinical animal models with 
all three vaccines prior to their approval for use in humans by the EMA.  
 
6. The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binds to the ACE2 receptor on platelets, which 
results in their activation [6]. Thrombocytopenia has been reported in severe cases 
of SARS-CoV-2 infection [7]. Thrombocytopenia has also been reported in 
vaccinated individuals [8]. We request evidence that the potential danger of platelet 
activation that would also lead to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) was 
excluded with all three vaccines prior to their approval for use in humans by the 
EMA.  
 
7. The sweeping across the globe of SARS-CoV-2 created a pandemic of illness 
associated with many deaths. However, by the time of consideration for approval of 
the vaccines, the health systems of most countries were no longer under imminent 
threat of being overwhelmed because a growing proportion of the world had already 
been infected and the worst of the pandemic had already abated. Consequently, we 
demand conclusive evidence that an actual emergency existed at the time of the 
EMA granting Conditional Marketing Authorisation to the manufacturers of all three 
vaccines, to justify their approval for use in humans by the EMA, purportedly 
because of such an emergency. 
 
Should all such evidence not be available, we demand that approval for use of the 
gene-based vaccines be withdrawn until all the above issues have been properly 
addressed by the exercise of due diligence by the EMA. 
 
There are serious concerns, including but not confined to those outlined above, that 
the approval of the COVID-19 vaccines by the EMA was premature and reckless, 
and that the administration of the vaccines constituted and still does constitute 
“human experimentation”, which was and still is in violation of the Nuremberg Code. 
 
In view of the urgency of the situation, we request that you reply to this email within 
seven days and address all our concerns substantively. Should you choose not to 
comply with this reasonable request, we will make this letter public.

Doctors and Scientists Accuse Medical Regulator of Downplaying COVID-19 
Vaccine Dangers 
The European Medicines Agency is misleading citizens into medical 
experimentation, experts warn 
April 1st 2021 
Doctors and scientists from 25 countries have today issued a rebuttal letter to the 
European Medicines Agency (EMA), following the regulator’s dismissal of their 
earlier warnings regarding COVID-19 vaccine dangers from clotting and bleeding. 
Within days of the EMA receiving the group’s original letter on March 1st, outlining 
risks of blood disorders from COVID-19 vaccines, over a dozen countries suspended 
the AstraZeneca vaccine following deaths from clotting and bleeding, as the doctors 
had warned.  
On March 23rd, however, the EMA dismissed the group’s concerns as relating to 
“minor” and “rare” events, concluding that “a positive benefit-risk balance has been 
established.” 
The doctors and scientists have today hit back, accusing the EMA of misleading the 
public on the vaccines’ true risk-benefit profile. “Your reply of March 23 is 
unconvincing and unacceptable,” they wrote, noting that recorded cases of life-
threatening cerebral venous thrombosis (CSVT) post-vaccination likely “represent 
just the tip of a huge iceberg”. Common reactions to vaccination, including 
headache, nausea, blurred vision and vomiting, they state, are symptoms of CSVT, 

and should be assessed as such, immediately. 
Clotting and bleeding after vaccination can also “be expected to increase with each 
re-vaccination, and each intervening coronavirus exposure” the group warned. Over 
time “this renders both repeated vaccination and common coronaviruses dangerous 
to young and healthy age groups, for whom - in the absence of ‘vaccination’ - 
COVID-19 poses no substantive risk. 
“Such is the real risk-benefit analysis of the COVID-19 ‘vaccines’. Either the EMA 
lacks the subject-matter expertise to appreciate the molecular science of this reality, 
or it lacks the medical ethics to act accordingly.” 
The group, Doctors for Covid Ethics, which includes professors of immunology and 
microbiology, described the EMA’s responses to their concerns as “unscientific”, 
“vague”, and lacking credibility. They have offered to liaise with the agency to 
mitigate against vaccination risks and ethics violations, including helping the EMA to 
“craft a focussed pharmacovigilance plan.”  
The group warned that continuing to administer inadequately tested gene-based 
COVID-19 vaccines represents dangerous medical experimentation, whose “true 
risks far outweigh any theoretical benefits”, reflecting “serious violations of medical 
ethics and citizens’ medical rights.” 
“Misleading populations into accepting investigational agents such as the gene-
based COVID-19 ‘vaccines’, or coercing them through ‘vaccine passports’, 
constitutes clear and egregious violations of the Nuremberg Code”, they caution.  
The letter is addressed to Emer Cooke, Executive Director of the EMA, and was 
copied to the lawyer Reiner Fuellmich, Charles Michel, President of the Council of 
Europe, and Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission.

APPENDIX IV 
 
Rebuttal Letter to European Medicines Agency from Doctors for Covid Ethics 
 
From Doctors for Covid Ethics 
To Emer Cooke 
Executive Director 
European Medicines Agency 
Amsterdam 
The Netherlands 
 
April 1st 2021 
Ladies and Gentlemen, 
FOR THE URGENT PERSONAL ATTENTION OF: EMER COOKE, EXECUTIVE 
DIRECTOR OF THE EUROPEAN MEDICINES AGENCY 
We acknowledge receipt of your March 23 reply to our letter dated February 28, 
seeking reassurance that foreseeable risks of gene-based COVID-19 “vaccines” had 
been ruled out in animal trials prior to human use.  Our concerns arise from multiple 
lines of evidence, including that the SARS-CoV-2 “spike protein” is not a passive 
docking protein, but its production is likely to  initiate blood coagulation via multiple 
mechanisms.  
Regrettably, your reply of March 23 is unconvincing and unacceptable. We are 
dismayed that you choose to respond to our request for crucially important 
information in a dismissive and unscientific manner. Such a cavalier approach to 
vaccine safety creates the unwelcome impression that the EMA is serving  the 
interests of the very pharmaceutical companies whose products it is your pledged 
duty to evaluate. The evidence is clear that there are some serious adverse event 
risks & that a number of people, not at risk from SARS-CoV-2, have died following 
vaccination.  
 
• 
You concede that the “vaccines”, which are more accurately described 
as investigational gene-based agents, enter the bloodstream but you can obviously 
provide no quantitative data. In the absence of the latter, any scientific assessment 
you purport to have undertaken lacks foundation. 
 
• 
Your statement that non-clinical studies do not indicate any detectable 
uptake of the vaccines into endothelial cells lacks credibility. We demand to see the 
scientific evidence. If not available, it must be assumed that endothelial cells are 
targeted. 
 
• 
Auto-attack could not have been excluded in animals unless they had 
been immunologically primed beforehand. We demand evidence that such 
experiments had been performed. Similar experiments have been undertaken before 
with previous, unsuccessful candidate vaccines, and fatal, antibody-dependent 
enhancement of disease was observed. 
 
• 
We requested scientific evidence, not a vague description of what was 
purportedly seen in non-valid animal experiments. Your cursory mention of 
laboratory findings in humans is cynical. In view of the plausible connection between 
production of spike protein and the emergence of thromboembolic serious adverse 
events (SAEs), we demand to see the results of D-dimer determinations. As you are 
aware, D-dimer is a very good test as an aid to diagnose thrombosis.  

After delivery of our letter to you on March 1, events followed that debunk your 
response to our last three queries to an extent that can only be termed 
embarrassing. As we feared, severe and fatal coagulopathies occurred in young 
individuals following “vaccination”, leading 15 countries to suspend their AZ-
“vaccination” program. An official investigation by the EMA into the cases of afflicted 
younger individuals followed, the results of which were announced by the WHO on 
March 17, 2021, stating: “At this time, WHO considers that the benefits of the 
AstraZeneca vaccine outweigh its risks and recommends that vaccinations 
continue.” 
What was this decision based upon? The WHO is not a competent body for formally 
evaluating drug safety. That is explicitly the role of the agency you lead.  
In your press release, you disclosed the following information to support your 
conclusion. You had scrutinized data on two mortally dangerous conditions that had 
followed within 14 days of “vaccination”: DIC, disseminated intravascular 
coagulation; and CSVT, cerebral sinus vein thrombosis. 5 DIC and 18 CSVT were on 
record, with a total death toll of 9. Most cases were <55 year-old individuals. 5 DIC 
and 12 CSVT were under 50 years of age. None were reported as having had 
serious pre-existing illness. 
You stated numbers that “normally” would  be expected : DIC  <1, CSVT 1.3. 
Consequently, for these very rare conditions, a link to vaccination could not entirely 
be dismissed. However, given that 20 million individuals had been “vaccinated”, the 
benefits were deemed to far outweigh the risks. 
But in fact, your Press Release rendered it glaringly apparent that the AZ-“vaccine” 
does have the potential to trigger intravascular coagulation, that the true risks far 
outweigh any theoretical benefits, and that any authority with the slightest sense of 
responsibility must suspend its further use. 
 
• 
Regard your incidence numbers for <50 year old individuals in the 
“vaccinated” versus “normal” population: 
CSVT : 12 versus 1.3. 
A 9-fold increase is beyond the range of coincidence. 
 
DIC  :  5 versus <1.  
As we hope you know, DIC never occurs out of the blue in healthy individuals. The 
incidence should not be stated as <1 when in reality it is ZERO.  
 
ACCORDINGLY, THE DIC CASES REPRESENT CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE THAT 
THE AZ-VACCINE ALONE CAN TRIGGER INTRAVASCULAR COAGULATION . 
 
 
• 
Assume that 10 million recipients of the “vaccine” were < 60 yrs and 
this was followed by 9 deaths due to DIC and SVCT. The death toll upon 60 million 
“vaccinations” would be extrapolatable to 54. 
The pandemic hit around 60 million individuals < 60 yrs in Germany. 
During the first 6 months it reportedly claimed 52 lives of individuals without pre-
existing illness.  
(https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Gesundheitsmonitoring/JoHM/2020/JoHM_Inhalt_20
_S11.html)  
Because of the unreliability of PCR testing and because of the completely novel way 
that deaths ‘with covid19’ are determined, the value of 52 is an over-estimate of the 
real burden of disease, further weakening your already-inadequate claim for risk-
benefit. 

How, then, can you declare that the benefits of vaccination far outweigh the risks? 
We demand your reply supported by facts and figures that we will convey to the 
public. 
 
 
• 
Further considerations expose the truly frightful dimensions of your 
irresponsible assertion. 
CSVT, cerebral venous thrombosis, is always a life-threatening condition that 
demands immediate medical attention. The number of cases you conceded had 
occurred can represent just the tip of a huge iceberg. As you must know, the most 
common symptoms of CSVT are piercing headache, blurred vision, nausea and 
vomiting. In severe cases, stroke-like symptoms occur including impairment of 
speech, vision and hearing, body numbness, weakness , decreased alertness and 
loss of motoric control. 
Surely, you are not oblivious to the fact that countless individuals suffered from 
precisely such symptoms directly following “vaccinations” with all the experimental 
gene-based agents. 
Clot formation in deep leg veins can lead to lethal pulmonary embolisms. Surely you 
must know that peripheral venous thromboses have repeatedly been reported 
following “vaccinations” with all the experimental gene-based agents  
Microthromboses in the lung vasculature can lead to misdiagnosis of pneumonia. In 
combination with false-positive PCR (with  high cycle thresholds), these will then be 
registered as COVID 19 cases. Surely you must know that this scenario has 
probably repeatedly taken place following “vaccinations” with all the experimental 
gene- based agents. 
In all events, extensive thrombi formation can lead to consumption of platelets and 
coagulation factors, resulting in hemorrhagic diathesis and bleeding at all possible 
locations. Surely you must know that profuse skin bleedings have repeatedly been 
observed following “vaccinations” with all the experimental gene-based agents. 
Given that there is a mechanistically plausible explanation for these thromboembolic 
adverse drug reactions (TE ADRs), namely that the gene-based products induce 
human cells to manufacture potentially pro-thrombotic spike protein, the reasoned & 
responsible assumption must now be that this may be a class effect. In other words, 
the dangers must be ruled out for all emergency-authorised gene-based vaccines, 
not merely the AZ product.  
We urge you to adopt this stance unless and until there is data providing high clinical 
confidence to the contrary. We are very willing to liaise with the Agency in order to 
help craft a focussed pharmacovigilance plan to accomplish this goal. With the 
above in mind, we hope you are aware that all thrombotic events can be rapidly 
diagnosed by measurement of D-Dimers in blood. And that good medical practice 
imperatively demands that attempts are undertaken to diagnose CSVT in any and 
every patient, young or old, presenting with the typical signs and symptoms following 
“vaccination”. 
Given the potential for adverse effects, potentially fatal ones, it is completely 
inappropriate and unacceptable that EMA permits these products, which hold only 
emergency use authorisations, to be administered to younger (<60y) people who are 
healthy, as they are at unmeasurable risks from SARS-CoV-2.   
Not to make this explicit is, in our view, a reckless stance to have taken in the first 
place and doubly so now. 
Of equal importance, you are bound by duty to investigate whether reasons exist for 
the waves of deaths that have occurred following “vaccination” of elderly residents in 

care and senior homes. Or are you asserting that dangers of “vaccine”-derived 
thrombotic events are limited to younger individuals? If not, restricting their use 
solely in one age group – as decided upon in Germany – equates with nothing less 
than monstrous, condoned genocide of the other.  
In closing, failure to inform “vaccine” recipients of the risks and negligible benefits 
outlined here represents serious violations of medical ethics and citizens’ medical 
rights. Those violations are especially grave as all the risks we describe can be 
expected to increase with each re-vaccination, and each intervening coronavirus 
exposure. This renders both repeated vaccination and common coronaviruses 
dangerous to young and healthy age groups, for whom - in the absence of 
“vaccination” - COVID-19 poses no substantive risk.  
Such is the real risk-benefit analysis of the COVID-19 “vaccines”. Either the EMA 
lacks the subject-matter expertise to appreciate the molecular science of this reality, 
or it lacks the medical ethics to act accordingly. 
At best, we regard the EMA’s complacent stance on vaccine dangers to be 
symptomatic of the fact that, under the prevailing politico-medical response to 
COVID-19, medical ethics has migrated from the consulting room to a geopolitical 
stage. Faced with a medical problem, mass-medical intervention has seen the 
practice of medicine taken from doctors’ hands. In this politicized context, corporate 
and political actors may consider themselves free from ethical constraints, operating 
unbound by a medical code of ethics, unlike medical doctors. All actors, however, 
are bound by the Nuremberg Code.  
The Nuremberg Code prohibits human experimentation of the very kind being 
endorsed and defended by the EMA. Even under the terms of their own original FDA 
authorization, COVID-19 vaccines are deemed “investigational” and their recipients 
“human subjects”, who are, by definition, entitled to informed 
consent.  https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-
documents/emergency-use-investigational-drug-or-
biologic#:~:text=Emergency%20use%20is%20defined%20as,21%20CFR%2056.102
(d)%5D. 
Misleading populations into accepting investigational agents such as the gene-based 
COVID-19 “vaccines”, or coercing them through “vaccine passports”, constitutes 
clear and egregious violations of the Nuremberg Code. The Nuremberg Code 
mandates voluntary informed consent “without the intervention of any element of 
force, fraud, deceit [or] duress”.   
https://history.nih.gov/display/history/Nuremberg+Code 
In other words, citizens have the right under the Nuremberg Code and related 
protections not to be subject involuntarily to medical experiments. It is clear that 
these experimental agents should be CONTRA-INDICATED in individuals not at 
elevated risk of serious illness & death if infected by SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the 
use of the experimental agents must also be withheld in the elderly population until a 
risk-benefit assessment has been properly conducted. In any event, the vaccine 
label must be revised to reflect the recently emerged serious adverse events 
addressed here.  
We remind the EMA that Nuremberg violations constitute crimes against humanity 
under the Geneva Convention. Crimes against humanity are deemed “the worst 
atrocities known to mankind”, and are prosecuted under the Rome Statute of the 
International Criminal Court.  https://www.un.org/en/chronicle/article/role-
international-criminal-court-ending-impunity-and-establishing-rule-law 
Given the hundreds of millions and eventually billions of people who may be coerced 

into accepting these agents, the EMA, in persistently shrinking from open debate and 
the truth, will be seen by lawyers and historians as having actively assisted in crimes 
against humanity, with the full weight of the implications to all involved. We demand 
that you engage openly with us to ensure that the public have an objective 
understanding of the clinical risk profile of these gene-based interventions.  
You understand that coercive pressure is being placed on citizens to receive COVID-
19 vaccines, which are experimental medical treatments. Your responsibility to those 
citizens includes ensuring that they are informed of the adverse event risks of every 
such treatment. To date you have failed to do so, and have instead misled the public 
on the reality of the “vaccines’” risk-benefit profile.  
If you continue to conceal the truth, efforts will be made to bring this to light and to 
see that justice is done. For the sake of the injured and the dead, and to protect 
further lives from similar fates. 
 
NOTICE 
For the avoidance of doubt, if your regulatory body does not immediately suspend its 
"emergency" recommendation of potentially dangerous inadequately tested gene-
based "vaccines", while the matters which we have highlighted to you are properly 
investigated, we hereby put the European Medicines Agency on notice of being 
complicit in medical experimentation, in violation of the Nuremberg Code, which 
thereby constitutes the commission of crimes against humanity. 
Furthermore, it is your indirigible duty as a regulatory body to ensure that all doctors 
worldwide are advised that they are taking part in medical experimentation via 
"vaccination" programmes, whether wittingly or unwittingly, with all the legal and 
ethical obligations that such involvement entails.

5)  Slovakia rejects signing the WHO Pandemic Treaty 
Prime Minister of Slovakia ordered investigation into COVID-19 response & vaccines  
 
Prime Minister of Slovakia, Robert Fico,  
Translation by William Makis MD  
Slovakia rejects signing the WHO Pandemic Treaty. Fico describes the jabs as 
‘experimental’ and ‘untested’. He speaks out about the abuse of the unvaccinated 
and mandatory vaccination as having had “scandalous consequences”. 
 
Fico calls WHO Pandemic Treaty "nonsense invented by greedy pharma companies" 
 
Prime Minister Fico:  
"If someone had a different opinion about vaccination against COVID-19, they were 
“dangerous to society”.  
 
“The media openly wrote, as you all remember, and I’m quoting right now: “that 
every unvaccinated person should squeal from pain like a pig. It is necessary to use 
force if someone rejects the policy of the needle” 
 
“One study after another confirms the scandalous consequences of mass 
vaccination with untested experimental vaccines.” 
 
“In the same way, I also very clearly declare, that SMER Slovakian Social 
Democracy (the ruling political party) will NOT support the strengthening of World 
Health Organization’s powers at the expense of sovereign states in managing battles 
against pandemics.” 
 
“I will say that such nonsense could only have been invented by greedy 
pharmaceutical companies which began to perceive the resistance of certain 

governments against mandatory vaccination." 
 
“This is a major development and it has dramatic global implications.” 
 
“One study after another confirms the scandalous consequences of mass 
vaccination with untested experimental vaccines.” 
 
Fico has also extensively called out corruption of the Ukrainian government and the 
financial aid that goes to Ukraine, as “maybe the biggest corruption in the world" 
 
He also intends to investigate the scandalous activities of the previous government 
during the pandemic including "the financial side of extensive, often completely 
nonsensical purchases medical devices and vaccines." 
 
January 30th 2024 Prime Minister Robert Fico speech before the European 
Parliament 
 
Slovak Prime Minister announced Slovakia would launch an investigation into the 
“COVID circus” related to the experimental vaccine rollout and pandemic response 
measures. 
 
“We will never understand the truth about what role pharmaceutical companies 
played and who actually organized the entire COVID-19 circus,” Fico said. “With this 
in mind, ladies and gentlemen, the Government of the Slovak Republic has decided 
to include a promise to resolve this issue in official announcements.” 
 
“The Slovak people simply need an answer. What was it really? Why were various 
experimental vaccines given to people without any testing? Why were all sorts of 
drugs pushed on people? Why was there statewide testing? Who bought these? 
Why were these purchased? How much quantity was purchased? How much money 
was spent on that? We end up with billions, billions!” 
 
Fico went on to explain that the investigation is especially warranted given Slovakia 
saw 21,000 excess deaths since 2020, which he blamed on “government 
incompetence.” 
 
“We have 21,000 deaths, which we connect with the fact that the governments that 
were here since 2020 were not capable of managing (the pandemic) and cared only 
about economic gains and of course made sure they were bowing to pharmaceutical 
companies from which they bought huge quantities of useless medical equipment 
and often also vaccines,” he said. 
 
Fico said Slovakia will create a new government office specifically to investigate the 
matter and appoint its Deputy of the National Assembly to lead the probe and publish 
its results. 
 
“Based on what we have available, we want to know what really happened. I think 
that Dr. Kotlar, Deputy of the National Assembly, is equipped with sufficient 
information,” he said. “I see that he is prepared, even when it comes to keeping the 
team together. I asked him to discuss everything in the cabinet before making any 

public statement. And I am absolutely, I repeat, absolutely confident that his work will 
yield results,which we will publish and tell the Slovak public what really happened 
during this COVID period.” 
“Today we know one thing: Previous governments absolutely failed to manage Covid 
and left 21,000 people to their own devices. And, as we all know, they made a lot of 
money from unnecessary purchases of various medical supplies and vaccines,” he 
concluded. 
 
 
 
6) Indonesia 
Senate Endorse Official Letter to refuse the WHO proliferation of Biolabs, the IHR as 
unfounded in law, amendments, the work of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Body 
and seek remedy to the fraudulent accusing of national debt and loss of control of 
natural resources, and refuse UN Nuclear submarines in Indonesian waters. 
 
Translation of Dr Kun and Siti Fadilah’s Statement. 
 
Dear. Ir. H. La Nyalla Mahmud Mattalitti 
Chairman of the Regional Representative Council 
Republic of Indonesia 
In place 
 
Yours faithfully, 
 
May Allah SWT always provide health, safety and convenience to Mr. Chairman of 
the Regional Representative Council of the Republic of Indonesia (DPD RI) in 
carrying out his mandate and daily duties. 
On this occasion we would like to convey the aspirations of the Indonesian people 
who are members of the Healthy Movement for the Indonesian People (GESURI) 
that we reject the concept of the Pandemic Treaty which is currently being discussed 
in the Intergovernmental Negotiating Body (INB) and will be adopted on May 24 
2024, and reject the Amendment International Health Regulations (IHR). The 
complete reasons for rejecting the Pandemic Treaty and the Amendments to the 
International Health Regulations (IHR) are fully explained in the Appendix. 
WHO is trying to take over Global Power by seeking that all member countries of the 
World Health Assembly (WHA) adopt amendments to the International Health 
Regulations (IHR) and adopt the proposed Pandemic Treaty. 
The proposed amendments would make the WHO statement legally binding and not 
just a recommendation. The changes would institutionalize the Global Digital Health 
Certificate and require countries to implement regulations WITHOUT respecting 
human dignity, human rights and fundamental freedoms. 
If the Indonesian state agrees to the Pandemic Treaty along with the Amendment to 
the International Health Regulations (IHR), this will have the impact of losing 
Indonesian State Sovereignty, hurting democracy, not respecting human rights, and 
not being in line with the basic principles and constitution of the 1945 Constitution. 
We ONLY recognize WHO as an advisory body, without any power to implement in 
Indonesia the recommendations they make. 
Indonesia is a country that adheres to People's Sovereignty as regulated in Article 1 
paragraph (2) of the 1945 Constitution, which states that "Sovereignty is in the hands 

of the people and is implemented according to the Constitution". We, the Indonesian 
people, claim our right to popular sovereignty in all matters, and do not cede any 
authority to WHO. 
We are responsible for our own health, and “We are not responsible to WHO”. 
Thus we convey, we thank you for your attention. 
Best regards, 
HEALTHY MOVEMENT FOR THE INDONESIAN PEOPLE (GESURI) 
Appendix 1 
This statement refers mainly to the WHO Treaty but applies to all international 
governance by the WEF, the IHR and amendments, GAVI, WHA, Conference of the 
parties, UN ‘Climate Action’, the military, and Artificial Intelligence.  
If Indonesia fails to actively reject any of the agreements, full executive powers and 
security silently pass to organizations that are protected from financial and 
operational liability. Simultaneously, the Indonesian government will remain 
responsible but lose the authority and ability to exercise control over any financial or 
operational risks.  
Any external instruction to proliferate weapons of mass destruction; Radiological 
(Smart) Biological (medical, mosquito & green ‘biotech’) and Nuclear, will be legally 
binding and implemented as a military protocol.  
Regardless of negotiations and final wording, control of the technology and data 
remain with the patent holders.  
 
 
 World Council For Health26th March 2024 
 
Dr Widya Murni, Indonesia World Council For Health, Expert Hearing 26th March 
2024 
After the Expert Hearing 40 Country Councils Voted Unanimously to exit the WHO 
 
Thank you for this opportunity to add the weight and gravitas of Indonesia’s doctors 
to this vote to stop the World Health Organization. Without further ado, I am Dr. 
Widya Murni, representing Indonesia & Country Council Indonesia. The WHO’s 
declaration and handling of the Covid 19 plandemic had a detrimental impact to our 
physical, emotional, mental wellbeing, economy, and democratic constitution that we 
are yet to recover from.  
 
Indisputably, the mandated lockdowns, masks and experimental vaccines constitute 
significant unlawful abuses of power by the authorities. The Amendments to the 
International Health Regulations and the proposed Treaty show that the WHO has 
no intention of returning our sovereignty or constitution, the Undang - Undang Dasar 
(UUD) 1945.  
During the pandemic, the threats and discrimination against Indonesian people were 
particularly harsh, with no financial or food provision made, despite the receipt of a 
pandemic fund. Even for many health practitioners like myself who are passionate in 
providing healthcare to our patients. All this by the restrictive order and direction from 
WHO. 
 
They have continued with experimental vector and vaccine programs but the lack of 
public consultation has woken up Indonesia to the fact that WHO are clearly 
contravening the Nuremburg Code and some are already arguing Genocide in the 

International Criminal Courts, with thousands of cases and pages of evidence being 
submitted. 
 
Indonesia is committed to there being another false declaration of world pandemic 
and all the harm that would follow. To make sure this is not allowed to happen again 
in the future, the World Health Organization and representatives in member states 
must be held to account by law.  
 
Most importantly WHO does not possess the same values, ethics and mission of a 
health authority but just acts as a business outlet to rule. We, therefore, will stress 
the importance of liberating ourselves from foreign rulings whose interests are to 
benefit themselves, not the people and global community. We should not consent to 
any tyrannical health or surveillance compulsions or colonization of our human rights 
ever again. The lack of transparency from WHO prompts us to question, do they 
endeavor representation of true care or just indignity enhancement.  
 
Report for Indonesia’s General, by :Frances 
Significance for Indonesia’s urgent withdrawal from the WHO treaty,  
of the Mosquito Releases, dated 11th November 2023 
  
Immediate Action required for Hankamrata: Total people defence 
Indonesia has two choices that must be made immediately or no longer have any 
choice at all. 
 
In two days’ time 13th November 2023 there is the planned Bali Mosquito Release, 
in Denpasar and another city.  
In two weeks’ time, 1st December, the withdrawal period closes, from the World 
Health Organization’s so-called Pandemic Treaty. After that date, it would take two 
years to withdraw and it may not be legal or allowed to withdraw.  
 
The WHO Amendments will give the WHO itself legally binding authority over all 
governments; to declare a pandemic, to lock down the country, to limit the movement 
of the people, to monitor and modify the behaviour of people, to inflict economic 
collapse, debt and starvation on the people, ban Indonesia’s own medicines, ban 
access to any self-sufficient farming methods - for example rice fields, as potentially 
a breeding ground for diseases, to allocate public money to Gain of Function 
research, pharmaceutical vaccine research, mosquito factories, and give the WHO 
the exclusive right to Approve such drugs for the market, to require governments buy 
supplies of these PPE and vaccines, and put mandates and penalties in place for 
any country, or individual man or woman’s acting with any freedom, which are in 
alignment with Indonesian medicine, religion, culture, wisdom, justice, and 
infrastructure that the government deem more successful to improve and provide 
national health.  
 
After the 1st December, no world government will have any choice at all.  
Stopping the mosquito release on National Security, and Scientific grounds (as well 
as legal and political) will provide the grounds for withdrawal from the agreement 
with the WHO Amendments (and lead and support other countries to do the same). 
This would be a major legacy for this incoming government. 
 

The way to raise it to a priority politically for this election period is to ask every 
minister and candidate for a statement about the WHO amendments. 
 
I bet only the health minister will know and not one other minister, let alone the 
Coordination Departments, have been consulted or reached an informed consensus 
about the huge impact. On this point, that only the Health Minister was consulted, we 
can show the example of the Mass Mosquito Release, going against the 2017 
legislation. We had to let the other ministers know, and that was after reading the 
mayor of Denpasar’s Instagram announcement just 6 weeks ago. 
 
The implications for the WHO treaty at government level, are that it will create an 
imbalance that the Ministry of Health will be much more powerful than any other 
department, and will no longer have to consult with even the ministry of defence. 
They will control the budgets and choices for all Indonesia. At the moment, if we 
discredit the actions by the minister of health as political control and financially 
motivated, as he is not a doctor, we can also question the Minister’s Pandemic 
Preparedness department and principles which are: 
 
1) Giving an unelected foreign organization (WHO) global power on totally false 
scientific grounds 2) The treatment of whole countries that are not sick. 3) 
Justification for ‘Gain of Function’ research, which involves the Public funding of 
genetic engineering of diseases, to be more fatal or virulent. Gain of Function 
research results are then not disclosed to the regulatory or environmental protection 
authorities, or available for independent testing. Instead, they are patented for the 
development of vaccines, by the pharmaceutical industry, and with-held for 
biosafety, by the military. The WHO argue that these diseases ‘could have happened 
in nature’ and they need to prepare. Governments have been lobbied to accept this 
false argument that GMOs are substantially equivalent to natural organisms. For 
example, the World Mosquito Program promote the mosquitoes as carrying 
Wolbachia “like many other insects do”. These engineered enhancements could 
never have happened in nature. DNA does not get damaged in nature. We have to 
use this scientific argument and challenge this foundational principle of pandemic 
preparedness and Gain of Function potential pandemic pathogens. 
 
The WMP and the Ministry for health falsely claim the mosquitoes are ‘natural’. The 
ways that the mosquitoes are scientifically unnatural are really important. We have to 
argue the other world-wide lie that has been lobbied to governments, that Gene 
Editing is different and safer than genetic modification.  
 
If the government take the time now to stop all bio-technology use in Indonesia, 
pending an investigation into this claim that Gene Editing is not GMO, we will have 
saved the nation.  If we don’t, we may not get these mosquitoes but we will have to 
watch out for and resist every “Green Technology” creation presented at the AIS 
Technology Conference on Bali (Oct. 10th and 11th 2023), such as plastic- and oil-
eating bacteria, and carbon capture and storage (CCS), engineering algae that could 
change the algae we rely on for oxygen, and every other unpredictable, unsafe and 
inaccurate edit of Nature’s gene pool (microbiome), that man believes he has 
achieved. 
 
Specifically, to understand today, the Aedes Aegypti mosquito has been bred to 

carry Wolbachia bacteria, inoculating the mosquitoes from Dengue. The risk is that 
the diseases including Dengue will themselves mutate into more dangerous strains 
of disease to compete with the Wolbachia. And Wolbachia itself causes Filarial 
diseases and is present in fish, birds, and human parasites, as well as transmitting 
water-borne diseases - where mosquito larvae live for two weeks.    
 
One legal precedent the government could use is that Microsoft were taken to court 
in 2003 for anti-competition practices, ending in the re-marketing of technologies as 
not for profit, health strategies. 
 
Indonesia can argue that Microsoft are creating a market for their vaccines, by 
supplying technology for a built-to-fail mosquito health strategy. And then creating 
another market, for their 5G and 6G smart cities, using health-justified monitoring 
and reducing the population’s ability to live and work in the natural environment, 
justified by saying it is for their own safety and to stop the spread. And then when we 
are a captured market, we will be vaccinated, even if the manufacturers are still 
saying an effective vaccine has not been found yet. 
 
(Senior WMP managers were at the All Eyes On Bali summit yesterday and admitted 
they had started releases in August in the north of Bali and there already are 
horrendous blood images and symptoms being observed, that do not test positive for 
Dengue or other familiar diseases.  
 
This could be a covert attack on Bali, which will be followed by Kalimantan, where 
the new capital is to be. And then on 12 other countries, via mosquitoes (as is stated 
in the WMP Scale UP PDF).  
 
However, we have to raise awareness of the attack on 193 countries through their 
acquiescence and blind acceptance of the International Health Regulation 
Amendments and WHO Treaty, via a multitude of health strategies.  
 
We need to find out at once, if it is only the Health Minister in each country who has 
been involved in negotiations and recommending adoption of the WHO Pandemic 
Preparedness Treaty. We must tell them to appeal to all their planning legislation to 
withdraw their country from inclusion, on grounds of the foreign-control being given, 
the level of impact on their country, the absence of financial and scientific due 
diligence in regard to the WHO, and the absence of due planning process with all 
ministers and competent authorities. 
 
At the same time, Indonesia does not have to conflict with the super powers of other 
countries. It can withdraw and state that it wishes to be the Control Group of the 
medical experiment. The Control Group exists already. The experiment is obviously 
the Global Smart Health Strategy.  
 
The mosquitoes and the majority of biotech for use in medicine, food, agriculture, 
conservation and military are all on an Experimental Permit of Approval. Every 
experiment needs a control group. Indonesia can prove that it can be self sufficient 
on all these levels, including the refusal of financial investment for research. 
 
Indonesia can use another quantitative and quantitative methodology for measuring 

our health and quality of life and biodiversity. The case against the WHO was 
brought by Indonesia’s previous Health Minister, to stop the WHO from taking 
Indonesia samples to America, of Avian Bird Flu. This could be used as a legal 
precedent. The taking of the samples was followed by gain of function engineering to 
create H5N1, which escaped from top security labs in America (ref. Institute For 
Responsible Technology White Papers and draft Bioweapons, Green Technology 
and GM Mosquitoes papers.) Now the samples she tried to guard are in Ukraine. 
 
We must stop the idea of Indonesia’s capital being a smart city under the control of 
surveillance through American artificial intelligence. Again the mosquitoes are 
strategic for the WHO (who did the risk analysis of the releases, and found 50 
potential biohazards as ‘negligible’). The Mosquitoes will carry Wolbachia IP 
Technology, coupled with CNN Artificial Intelligence. The mosquitoes have an 
interest in human blood as they bite in order to feed and breed. The biggest business 
in the world is interested in human blood too, including DNA information, data, and 
samples. There has already been major evidence that the Covid vaccines have 
corrupted blood in a myriad of detrimental ways.   
 
All these mRNA and other biotechnologies are foreign-owned and patented with 
exclusive rights to access the data and control the equipment. This will inevitably 
exclude Indonesian oversight. 
 
In the case of producing and releasing disease vectors; a gene drive technology is 
irreversible. In addition, environmental protection agencies will not be given the 
information on the exact gene sequence/strain of wolbachia or the ingredients in 
vaccines, to be able to monitor their spread. Gene drive technology is not approved 
for release outside a laboratory. The World Mosquito Program answer. 1) It is not a 
gene drive but they intend for the mosquitoes to replace the wild mosquitoes (the 
exact definition of a gene drive) 2) The mosquitoes are harmless - this is not a 
scientific statement and not backed up by any scientific evidence) 3) The mosquitoes 
are natural and deny IP technology in them. This is a denial of the one monitoring 
system and control (possibly) system, of the mosquitoes, that Bali has. The Minister 
for health has bought a license for the Wolbachia Technology and yet he denies its 
existence.  
 
The investigation must include whether 1) the minister intended to sell the data? Or 
2) whether he must hand over the data for the foreign owner of the technology? Or 
3) Whether the Health Minister intended to deny a mosquito release monitoring 
system, specifically in order to avoid liability for damages. 
 
In the case to stop the mosquito release on Monday, it has been shown that the 
program is Australian Funded, fully. It is not a government program. It is likely, 
however that the Department of Health with say that the Implementer is from the 
Department of Health and therefore it is a government program. The implementer, is 
Wiwied Trisnadi. When asked what he had worked before that prepared him to 
manage the release of 200 million mosquitoes with confidence, he said the 
Pandemic Preparedness section in the Ministry for Health. He also said that he does 
not know anything about the science behind  the mosquito method and is unaware of 
any risks to environment or ecosystem.  
 

If the Wolbachia bacteria is inherited or it is self-replicated, they are both equally 
dangerous but the implementers with liability have no idea of what they are 
responsible for. 
  
If the WHO treaty is agreed, Indonesians will be subjected to the worst lockdowns, 
with no financial supports for the people, the worst strains of disease will remain un-
recorded, and the environment will be uninhabitable.

Plaintiffs, v. BOARD OF LAND AND NATURAL RESOURCES, STATE OF HAWAI‘I, 
and DEPARTMENT OF LAND AND NATURAL RESOURCES, STATE OF HAWAI‘I, 
Contesting the deployment of military biotechnologies on an experimental and 
emergency permit, on the pretext of ‘conservation. 
Court proceedings to stop 775,992,000 biopesticide lab-reared Wolbachia-bacteria-
infected mosquitoes per week. 807 billion over 20 years, still on an emergency 
permit; with no Environmental Impact Assessment, in the fragile ecosystems of East 
Maui. 
Plaintiff Lia, on behalf of Hawaii Unites, verbally requested a contested case hearing 
for agenda item C-2 “Request Approval of Final Environmental Assessment and 
Authorization for the Chairperson to Issue a Finding of No Significant Impact for the 
‘Suppression of Invasive Mosquito populations to Reduce Transmission of Avian 
Malaria to Threatened and Endangered Forest Birds on East Maui’” 
 
On March 13, 2023, Plaintiff Lia filed a complaint on behalf of Hawaii Unites with the 

State of Hawai‘i Office of the Ombudsman, requesting an investigation into the BLNR 
for interference with the public’s ability to testify at the BLNR meeting on March 10, 
2023. Per Tina Lia’s complaint, the BLNR Secretary emailed incorrect and 
inoperative information for providing video testimony at the meeting. The BLNR then 
rearranged the agenda items at the March 10, 2023, meeting in random order with 
no explanation to the public waiting to testify. Testifiers for the biopesticide mosquito 
project agenda item were made to sit through the entire eight-hour meeting, reduce 
their testimony from three minutes to two minutes each, and listen to the BLNR 
members joking and laughing about the postponement of the biopesticide mosquito 
project agenda item. 
Hawaii Unites has repeatedly presented documented, compelling evidence of the 
risks and impacts of the biopesticide mosquito project to the BLNR. Rather than 
acknowledge and address the organization’s concerns, the BLNR has acted in a 
consistently dismissive and disruptive manner towards this testimony. The rights of 
Hawaii Unites, of the organization’s supporters, and of the public, to open 
governmental processes have been infringed upon by the BLNR in their effort to 
silence discussion about the risks and impacts of the project. 
 
Hawaii Unites dispute that BLNR’s powers include the authority to “adopt rules”; 
“appoint hearing officers to conduct public hearings”; bring enforcement actions; and 
establish “restrictions, requirements, or conditions …relating to the use of particular 
land being disposed of, the terms of sale, lease, license, or permit, and the 
qualifications of any person to draw, bid, or negotiate for public land. “Land” is 
defined to include “all interests therein and natural resources including water.”

10. Singapore World Mosquito Program release only males but allow for a tiny 
percentage of the breeding biting females to be released. In Indonesia and Sri 
Lanka, the World Mosquito Program had developed their business plan to allow for a 
female bias - which meant that the majority of lab-born mosquitoes were born female 
as the males were sterile. They created false promotional material to suggest that 
both males and female eggs should be deployed.  
The Singapore study showed that about 3 female mosquitoes accidentally released 
caused “total population replacement”: By definition that is a ‘gene drive’ which is a 
technology so dangerous that over 300,000 people and groups signed a petition for 
a moratorium on even gene drive research. Gene drives have never been approved 
for open air release, but the defendants and their agents 
 
“Wolbachia-mediated sterility suppresses Aedes aegypti populations in the urban 
tropics” – The Project Wolbachia – Singapore Consortium, Ng Lee Ching 
 
"In Tampines, where pipeline-sorted wAlbB-SG males were released, we detected 
wAlbB-positive adult females sporadically and at lower frequencies than in Yishun 
(Fig. 6B). From May 2020 onwards, however, following a year of very low wildtype 
Aedes aegypti population, we observed a steady increase in wAlbB-positive adult 

females caught (Fig. 6B) in the Tampines core, along with a rebound in the wildtype 
Aedes aegypti population in the same area. This suggests that even with high-fidelity 
sorting, inadvertent release of a few fertile females can lead to stable establishment 
of Wolbachia in the field, given the lack of competition from the nearly eliminated 
wildtype population.” 
 
"Our data further show that when the wildtype mosquito population is suppressed to 
very low levels—possibly close to elimination, as in the Tampines core—release of 
even a few fertile wAlbB-SG females could result in establishment of wAlbB in the 
field population. This threshold may be as low as three individuals, the minimum 
number of wAlbB-SG females we believe were released in the Tampines core during 
Phase 2.”

The defendant in the medical equipment corruption case Siti Fadilah Supari 
discusses with legal advisors during a break in the follow-up trial at the Corruption 
Court, Jakarta, Wednesday, June 7 2018. (Antara/Puspa Perwitasari) 
 The United States   Navy (US Navy) has the Naval Medical Research Unit 
Detachment-2 (Medical Research Unit Two/NAMRU-2).This is the Navy's biomedical 
research laboratory, which was established with the aim of studying infectious 
diseases that have potential importance from a defense perspective in Asia.NAMRU-
2 is officially registered under the US Naval Medical Research Center Command, 
located in Silver Spring, State of Maryland, and is considered the center of a network 
of laboratories located in various locations around the world.NAMRU-2 operates in 
several countries in Southeast Asia, including Vietnam, Laos, Singapore, the 
Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia and Cambodia.Specifically in Phnom Penh, 
Cambodia, NAMRU-2 was opened, equipped and operated as a satellite laboratory 
to conduct research on possible infectious disease outbreaks on a regional scale, 
with support from the Singapore Embassy's Defense Cooperation office.Meanwhile, 
other laboratory locations include Peru, Kenya and Egypt. Meanwhile, NAMRU-2, 
which previously operated in Indonesia, was relocated to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii and 
officially opened as NAMRU-2 Pacific on June 17 2010, and closed in 2013. 
History of NAMRU 
NAMRU-2 was initiated in Guam during World War II and operated under the 
Rockefeller Foundation. Its primary function when founded, was to study infectious 
diseases, which had potential importance in military considerations in Asia. This unit 
was then founded in 1955 in Taipei, Taiwan, and operated for 24 years. In 1958, a 
classic cholera epidemic broke out in Bangkok, Thailand, for the first time in ten 
years. NAMRU 2 responded to the Taiwanese Government's request for assistance. 
Then, annual research appeared in Thailand for several years, plus the El Tor type 

of cholera, which appeared in 1961 in Sulawesi.This outbreak became the 7th 
pandemic, which quickly became the center of attention of the NAMRU-2 agenda, 
along with how to overcome it.In 1968, reported by Suara Pemberda from Wikipedia 
, the Indonesian Ministry of Health discussed starting a separate unit in Jakarta, 
Indonesia.  This request from the Indonesian Ministry of Health was motivated by the 
disease that hit Boyolali Regency, namely in Selo District and Cepogo District, where 
101 people fell ill, and 42 of them died with a case fatality rate (CFR] of 42 percent. 
This unit was then established in 1970 at the official invitation of representatives of 
the Indonesian Ministry of Health to investigate infectious diseases of significance to 
both the US Navy, and the US Department of Defense. In 1979, as a result of the 
recognition of the sovereignty of the People's Republic of China by the US, NAMRU-
2 was asked to leave Taiwan, and move to Manila, Philippines.In 1990, due to 
political turmoil in the Philippines and potential threats to US personnel, the US 
deemed it prudent to house this command center, as there was a desire to reduce 
the US presence in Manila.The US Navy then began negotiating the parent unit's 
move to Jakarta, and discussions began between the US Department of State and 
the Indonesian Government.The main unit then officially moved to Jakarta in 1991, 
and the unit in Manila was closed in June 1994.After that, NAMRU-2 also began to 
formulate ways to handle infectious disease threats for US military personnel, who 
were dispatched to Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia.  Joint research projects were 
initiated with local authorities in these countries. Then, the World Health 
Organization (WHO) appointed NAMRU-2 as a collaboration center for new diseases 
for Southeast Asia.In 2002, activities in Phnom Penh were initiated by NAMRU-2, 
with the aim of research into regional infectious diseases, and laboratory support to 
diagnose them.This operation was performed from a laboratory located at the 
National Institute of Public Health in Pnom Penh, Cambodia.  In 2007, with the 
priority of responding to global infectious disease threats, NAMRU-2 began carrying 
out separate unit preparation steps in Pnom Penh with the support of the Singapore 
Embassy's Office of Defense Cooperation.The main and central laboratory of 
NAMRU-2 was in Jakarta until 2010, when the request was closed by the Indonesian 
Government.Later, the central element of this unit was moved to Pearl Harbor, 
Hawaii and officially opened as NAMRU-2 Pacific on June 17, 2010, and closed in 
2013.  
Collaboration for NAMRU-2 with Indonesia 
The NAMRU-2 unit in Jakarta, Indonesia, began 'playing' in 1968, between the 
Indonesian Ministry of Health and the US, as a separate unit from the facility in 
Taipei, Taiwan. This unit was then officially established in 1970 at the official 
invitation of representatives of the Indonesian Ministry of Health.Following political 
turmoil in Manila, the parent unit officially moved to Jakarta in 1991, and the Manila 
unit was closed in June 1994.NAMRU-2 Jakarta occupies an area of 5,670 meters, 
which consists of laboratories. The storage area is in three complex buildings of the 
Indonesian Ministry of Health (Badan LITBANGKES).The facility also features animal 
storage facilities, which are accredited by the American Association for the 
Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC).It also includes a 220 square 
meter BL3 laboratory that was moved from its previous location in Korea.Apart from 
the facilities in Jakarta, another facility which is quite modern and complete is the 
418 square meter research facility in Jayapura, Irian Jaya.The NAMRU-2 staff 
consists of 175 Indonesian employees and 19 US employees.In 2001, a book 
entitled Program Evaluation: Perspectives on the Department of Defense Global 
Emerging Infections Surveillance and Response System: a program review was 

published in Washington DC, USA. This book reviews the many programs carried 
out by NAMRU-2 in Indonesia, including its collaboration with WHO. Among other 
things, influenza disease surveillance efforts in Indonesia are considered weak, 
because there are many uses in nasopharyngeal specimen sampling techniques 
.Therefore, it was considered that it would be better if this sample was carried out at 
an international level. The evaluation results also stated that samples sent to several 
places, including Australia, had a low level of coordination for reporting 
back.Tuberculosis (TB) surveillance in Indonesia is also assessed: Many TB cases 
are undiagnosed throughout the country. Laboratories in Indonesia are not equipped 
with the ability to diagnose and monitor germ resistance to the drugs administered, 
thereby threatening the population of US citizens living in Indonesia.HIV cases are 
starting to appear, and it is feared that if the HIV virus starts to associate with TB 
germs, TB cases will increase drastically. NAMRU-2 also faces resource challenges, 
with requests for training from the Indonesian Ministry of Health for various 
matters.Among the research requested to be carried out at universities in Indonesia, 
the problem is that research results from universities in Indonesia do not have a 
direct channel, which could have an impact on health management in Indonesia.In 
2005, bird flu became a serious health problem for the world, and Indonesia was 
worst affected with 141 cases and 115 deaths.Indonesian Minister of Health Dr Siti 
Fadilah Supari initially complied with WHO regulations and followed all the rules.One 
of the vaccines, Prototype, was later developed by the Australian company CSL and 
supported by the Australian Government.Efforts to make this vaccine are aimed at 
protecting medical workers, if an outbreak occurs.But then, former Australian Health 
Minister Tony Abbott gave a media statement that the vaccine would only be 
available to Australian citizens.Although this was later denied by Robert McClelland 
from the Labor Party, that the party's policy of sharing the CSL vaccine with 
Indonesia and other countries in Southeast Asia was to spread this 
disease.However, this then triggered a cessation of sending samples of the bird flu 
virus from Indonesia to the rest of the world. 
 
In the same year, 2007, Siti as Minister of Health of the Republic of Indonesia 
announced that Indonesia would no longer provide bird flu viruses to the World 
Health Organization (WHO) through the Influenza Monitoring Network Division 
(GISN). According to Siti, GISN does not pay attention to the needs and interests of 
developing countries.  Siti also argued that WHO had violated its own regulations in 
that the virus was transferred using double standards, received from countries 
affected by the virus through GISN, and handed over to commercial companies for 
vaccine development. Then, these vaccines became very expensive and available in 
countries affected by the virus, while rich industrial countries were busy using them 
just in case the outbreak hit. This statement was later recorded with the title It's Time 
for the World to Change .In her book, Siti revealed that since 1952, as many as 110 
countries with flu cases have been obliged to share virus specimens without 
conditions. These viruses are collected by GISN, become their property, and by 
experts, then carry out risk considerations and research, and another side, namely 
making virus seeds which are then made into vaccines.Viruses that are classified as 
malignant are then announced at the WHO Collaborating Centers (WHO-CCs), 
which are laboratories that collaborate with WHO, and become reference 
laboratories.  These reference laboratories are approved by Australia, Japan, UK 
and US.Then, this vaccine was then compared to oil, where he expressed his 
frustration that because Indonesia could not process crude oil it had to adopt ready-

to-use oil.  
 
Dangerous when Shipped to the USHis book also reviews the possibility of these 
viruses being developed into biological weapons, when they were sent to the Los 
Alamos National Laboratory, New Mexico, USA.This is because only a handful of 
scientists are allowed to research these derived DNA viruses.According to his book, 
Los Alamos is a laboratory for biological, chemical and nuclear weapons, so making 
vaccines or chemical weapons depends on the will and interest of the US 
Government.This is considered very dangerous. An internet search by Siti then 
revealed that this laboratory had been closed, and the virus had been sent to Bio 
Health Security (BHS).The results of his investigation revealed that many scientists 
were transferred from Los Alamos to BHS.So, his theory regarding the game of 
biological and chemical weapons, is still correct, then the name and location have 
changed.Negotiations were then initiated by Indonesia at the World Health Assembly 
(WHA) , which demanded a fair and transparent transfer of viruses. This effort is 
supported by many other countries that are members of WHO. There are two main 
things that Siti takes issue with: Non-transparent distribution channels for sending 
viruses where she proposes standardizing naming and licensing from countries that 
have the virus to other countries where the virus is sent. WHO also considers WHO's 
pandemic warning escalation indicators to be weak and must be reviewed together.  
Escalating pandemic warnings affecting visits to the country, medical supplies, 
vaccines, masks, safety suits, all of which are big business.Siti gave the example of 
Mexico which is currently in a difficult position, but at the same time benefits large 
companies.However, this meeting was short because Minister Fadila was asked to 
return to Indonesia due to the outbreak, and many important discussions did not take 
place.Indonesia then began sending more samples of the virus based on 
international countries' conventions, that the Indonesian H5N1 bird flu virus is very 
dangerous for humans.Therefore, it is considered that it is very important to have a 
laboratory that has the opportunity to analyze it in detail, compare it with viruses 
similar to other worlds, and protect Indonesia and other countries from its 
spread.This was also questioned  at the World Health Meeting , even though 
Indonesia has its own geographical area, and the spread of disease does not see 
national boundaries.US observer Scott McPherson, who is a US Government 
consultant, businessman and disaster preparation and recovery expert, stated in his 
blog that this issue was considered 'unreasonable' by the Indonesian Ministry of 
Health. Scott also reminded that Indonesia did not show any gratitude at all for what 
the US had done in Tangerang in eradicating Bird Flu in 2008. In addition, the 
communication of the bird flu virus does not need to be weaponized by humans to 
spread, because the birds themselves already do this. Meanwhile, another observer, 
Debora MacKenzie, a contributor to New Scientist , stated in her blog that Siti 
Fadilah's stance on the transparency of virus transfer was reasonable. Therefore, 
WHO responded with the development of a virus system, which went everywhere in 
the security system and scientific world. Total retaliation. 
 
Discussions are also starting to be opened to discuss better procedures for sharing 
results.Meanwhile, biological weapons are a wrong conclusion. Debra added that 
between the two options of biological weapons or vaccines for profit, the second one 
actually shows the more likely scenario.US aid funds and NAMRU-2 Diplomatic Staff 
ImmunityIn October 2005, during his visit to Asian countries, the US Minister of 
Health and Human Services, Mike Leavitt, stated that he had allocated funds 

amounting to 3.15 million US dollars to help deal with bird flu cases in Indonesia.The 
total assistance received by Indonesia was 25 million US dollars as initial 
assistance.The Japanese government also sent a team of experts, three diagnostic 
laboratory experts, who will start working and coordinate with the Indonesian Ministry 
of Health.Meanwhile, the Australian Government handed over 50 thousand Tamiflu, 
an anti-influenza virus drug produced by PT Roche and confirmed by the 
International Health Organization (WHO).  Australia also stated that it would increase 
its assistance by 10 million Australian dollars to combat the threat of bird flu in 
Indonesia, as stated by Foreign Minister Alexander Downer in front of President 
Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono at that time.Thus, the aid package to Indonesia to deal 
with bird flu will be 15.5 million Australian dollars. This is because they had 
previously promised aid of five million Australian dollars.However, according to Siti in 
her book, It's Time For The World To Change, Indonesia has never seen any related 
aid money from the US Government.During US Secretary of State Condoleezza 
Rice's visit to Indonesia in 2006, Siti asked where the aid funds used by the US 
were, which according to Siti, could be used for referral hospitals. Siti then realized 
that US aid had been given to NAMRU-2, arguing that this laboratory was conducting 
H5N1 research, and had coordinated with the Ministry of Health, and employed 175 
employees, of which 19 were US citizens.In April 2008, a telegram sent by the US 
Embassy Jakarta to Washington, which was leaked by the Wikileaks website, 
reported on developments, in which there was news announcing that the Indonesian 
Government had closed NAMRU-2.The US Embassy in Jakarta is aware of this 
closure, and requested that Washington respond to the MoU that was sent, so that 
talks can continue.The decision whether to close NAMRU-2 or not was postponed in 
June 2008, because the Indonesian side had a different opinion.  The Indonesian 
government, including representatives of political parties in the government, is 
divided between wanting to maintain and close it.Meanwhile, Indonesian Health 
Minister Siti Fadilah in her speech at the Namru-2 US Army Laboratory dialogue in 
the heart of Jakarta, where is the TNI in the same month, asked for people's support 
to close NAMRU-2. Sentences such as 'expelled, useless', and 'colonized', are used 
in the argument. Negotiations from the US side continued to demand demands 
because their staff while the Indonesian side refused to send virus samples. 
 
In October 2008, Siti refused (again) to send virus samples to NAMRU-2 due to the 
issue of foreign intelligence, and the request that the US comply with Indonesia 
regarding the Material Transfer Agreement (virus). The accusation of intelligence 
activity was denied by the US Ambassador to Indonesia Cameron Hume, stating that 
everything that happened at NAMRU-2 was transparent.  All research projects have 
been approved by the Ministry of Health, and the Indonesian Government has 
access to research being undertaken, so this accusation of non-transparency is 
strange. Hume also asked Indonesia to separate the issue of NAMRU-2 and the 
Material Transfer Agreement (virus) or also known as the Material Transfer 
Agreement, because these are two different things.In her best-selling book, It's time 
for the world to change, Dr. Siti Fadilah Supari wrote that after the H5N1 bird flu 
outbreak, which at one point was discovered in Indonesia.He also objected to the 
practice of mandatory local spread of the virus. samples with WHO-affiliated 
structures, which he said were not transparent and fair.Siti is not only concerned that 
the samples might end up in the hands of those responsible for making weapons of 
mass destruction.But also the fact that the vaccines produced by large 
pharmaceutical companies that use these samples will later be sold back to the 

country of origin of the specimens for profit.

13. Elon Musk’s proliferation of radiological seasons of mass destruction. 
It was just revealed that Elon Musk’s company Twitter/X has been profiting off of

This is exactly the type of warrantless government surveillance we’re trying to stop in 
the fight over Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), which 
is expected on the House Floor next week. Musk shouldn’t be allowed to sell user 
data to the government for surveillance AND the government shouldn’t be allowed to 
surveil without a warrant. 
Congress must overhaul government spying powers immediately — and votes are 
imminent that will decide whether lawmakers will rubber-stamp mass surveillance on 
a UN/WHO directive. 
Urge lawmakers before they vote — end mass surveillance, no more warrantless 
spying on Americans! 

The spying powers in Section 702 are abused by the government to spy on 
Americans (collecting, using, and sharing our personal data, including online 
communications) without a warrant. And Elon Musk shouldn’t be profiting off of our 
data and government surveillance. 
 
Section 702 has been abused in ways that violate fundamental civil liberties and civil 
rights. FBI agents have abused this authority to search through millions of acquired 
communications for conversations, including thousands of protestors, racial justice 
activists, journalists, donors to political campaigns, and countless others. Meanwhile, 
more and more law enforcement and intelligence agencies are bypassing privacy 
rights by purchasing our sensitive location and online information from data brokers. 
Even though the Fourth Amendment protects our right to keep our information 
private, the government is collecting troves of our data without a warrant with the 
help of Elon Musk. 
Votes on Section 702 are imminent – join us and take action now.

Peace and reconciliation is possible. There are 130 million forcibly displaced people 
in the world. It was 70 million ten years ago. This is all United Nations-orchestrated 
instability, with their American shadow directors.  
The charges against George Soros in regard to the migrant and refugee crises and 
trafficking have remained only legendary, without being upheld in courts. But this 
Appeal must address the causes and assign liability and the decommissioning of the 
corporate machines that facilitate them. The wars would stop instantly, if the Federal 
Supreme Court decides to empower men and women by law in our mass 
conscientious objection to the violence and extortion. All people yearn to return to 
their homes, with resources to rebuild them, a chance of living a good life on the land 
of their ancestors, or supporting farmers to make it productive again, knowing they 
are safe and protected by a world-wide acknowledgement in law, of our bodily 
integrity, sovereignty, resonance and equanimity with each other.

Complete Nuclear Disarmament CND’s Bruce Kent,  Buckey Boone, Linda Cataldo 

Modica and Rob Forsyth spoke at UN: 
Showing the breach of Nuclear Weapons Treaties, make the case for the incongruity 
of calling nuclear a deterrent, and the spending of 205 billion on Trident and under-
spending on National Health Service. 
 
Bruce Kent is a British political activist and a laicised Roman Catholic priest. Active 
in the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND), he was the organisation's general 
secretary from 1980 to 1985 and its chair from 1987 to 1990. He now holds the 
honorary title of vice-president. Bruce Kent was the first speaker to address what the 
Treaty For The Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, that was signed by 122 countries 
and ratified on the 22nd January 2021 means and what can we do to encourage the 
UK to sign it. 
 
He emphasized public awareness and the power of public opinion by juxtaposing the 
under funding of the NHS and the huge costs of the UK’s nuclear weapons. He 
pointed out how many people are waiting for medical treatment and complaints 
about the underfunding of the NHS are commonplace but we never see people 
complain about the 205 billion for the Trident replacement for example, as people 
just don’t know. He recommended having a simple poster or flier in the window of 
your house and car, to highlight the comparison with a statement “Fund the NHS. 
Stop Funding Nuclear Weapons”, to link them in people’s minds as a choice the 
government are making.  
 
His second point was the massive risk of accident, miscalculation and the 
consequences of a nuclear strike. We were starkly reminded of the reality of the 
instruction or command to press the button to launch a nuclear missile. He told us 
about Stanislav Petrov, a Soviet commander general who, in 1983, received the 
command to send a nuclear bomb, as retaliation when  Russia received faulty 
information that they were under nuclear attack.  Petrov luckily refused but there 
continues to be a massive responsibility and vulnerability to catastrophic error, in 
information, communications and decision making. 
 
The third point was the incongruence of calling UK nuclear weapons ‘independent’. 
He likened it to the claim that your car was independent transport, even when you 
had to borrow wheels from a neighbour to actually use it.  
 
Buckey Boone  
Appalachian Peace Education Centre (APEC) in Abingdon, Virginia. 
 
Buckey started by telling us about the Appalachian Peace Education Centre (APEC) 
started in 1982 about the same time as our group, in reaction to the Nuclear Freeze 
Movement. (Initiatives calling for a bilateral freeze on production, deployment and 
testing of nuclear weapons. In 1982, nine states, 275 city governments, and 446 
town hall meetings passed pro-freeze resolutions. Of the 18 million Americans who 
voted on the freeze policy that year, 60% voted in support of it). 
 
Because their town is Abingdon, Virginia, they early on formed a sister relationship 
with us at the Abingdon Peace Group. 
The group has worked since then and right up until today to eliminate nuclear 
weapons. However, early on, a year or two after they started, they expanded their 

mission to address other peace issues including their government’s military 
interventions in wars as well as justice issues. They established the first 
environmental organization in their region. We developed a project to welcome 
Mexican migrants to their area. They developed the first support group for LGBTQ 
persons in their region and work for racial justice in the area; starting the first Martin 
Luther King celebration, 35 years ago. Their major focus in this last year has been 
on racial justice, after the murder of George Floyd. They organized a vigil and a 
march in Abingdon and joined with other local groups that advocate with schools, 
police and prosecutors, to improve their policies around equity.  
 
They also advocated for changes in State Law, mainly in Virginia, where they had a 
chance. Unlike, he thought, in Tennessee where his colleague Linda was speaking 
from, where there are not so many opportunities. In Virginia, though, they have seen 
major changes in laws around racial justice and equity. 
 
Most exciting, he felt, was the abolition of the Death Penalty in the state that is just 
about to happen. Over the five or so Martin Luther King celebrations, some of the 
events were even better attended because they were on Zoom – named as a very 
slight plus to the Covid restrictions.  
 
Oakridge Environmental Peace Alliance 
They have a neighbouring peace organization, the Oakridge environmental peace 
alliance. Oakridge is where atomic weapons were first built in World War II. OEPA 
has been witnessing against the building of nuclear weapons for over 20 years with 
weekly vigils. Three years ago, when the government restarted its manufacture of 
nuclear weapons and started to rebuild existing buildings in Oakridge, OEPA sued 
them over environmental issues and have been successful, so far, in halting 
construction.  
 
The OEPA have been leaders in response to the new UN treaty: https://orepa.org/) 
offering resources https://orepa.org/nuclear-ban-treaty-entry-into-force-resources/ 
and a national meeting to talk of next steps after ratification of the treaty on Jan 22nd 
https://orepa.org/a-moment-or-a-movement/ ) 
 
Linda Cataldo Modica 
Linda Modica was also one of the founding members of APEC, a member of the 
Sierra Club and of the United Religions. She spoke at the United Nations 
negotiations, in New York, on anti-nuclear weapons.  
 
She started by describing her chance to talk at the UN during negotiations on the 
prohibition of nuclear weapons as a privilege. She said explained how she was there 
to bear witness to the contamination caused by local company Nuclear Fuel 
Services. They have a tangible connection to our work in the UK because they are 
the sole provider of nuclear fuel for navy submarines, which enable nuclear missiles 
to be deployed, in the marine prong of the nuclear triad.  
 
She believes she had a responsibility to work towards complete nuclear 
disarmament and against the destruction of the environment by Nuclear Fuel 
Services, who have been proven to have polluted 95 river miles downstream of their 
plant. Tens of thousands of people rely on that river for drinking water so they have 

got a lot of concern and support. This is not just local but also created a wider intent 
to get the United States to plan for disarmament and to abide by Article 6 of the Non 
Proliferation Treaty NPT. Recent actions have included a series of events for the 
75th anniversary of Horishima and Nagasaki.  Linda was honoured as the Hibakusha 
(the survivors of the blasts) made peace cranes. (The origami crane is a symbol of 
both peace and remembrance around the world and is closely associated with the 
story of the young victim of the Hiroshima blast, Sadako Sasaki). 
 
 For the anniversary, garlands of these peace cranes were sent to elected public 
officials in Tennessee and Virginia, along with a letter that urged their country to 
disarm. They mentioned, specifically, the modernization programme for nuclear 
weapons which will cost about 2 trillion dollars over the next 30 years. Nuclear 
modernization is being planned but there is no planning yet towards disarmament – 
but, Linda said, they’re working on it! 
 
Sierra Club 
Linda is working with the Sierra Club as she is a long-term Sierra Club activist and 
there was good news from them recently. The Sierra Club is the largest and most 
prestigious environmental organization with a million membership. They announced 
that they are going to put together a specialized expert team to work on the 
prohibition of nuclear weapons. This dedicated team will also work on the inividual 
projects that are currently being planned for new nuclear weapons, such as the 100 
billion that is being planned for ICBMs. (Bulletin in chat)  
 
One of the things she found startling was that one specialist said that many people 
consider American deterrents a success, pointing to the fact that no country has ever 
attacked the United States using nuclear weapons. She likened this to Muppets’ 
philosophy (as in Kermit the Frog) when Ernie tells Burt that a banana in his ear has 
successfully protected him from alligator attack: It relies on the same faulty logic: The 
absence of the alligators doesn’t prove the banana worked! 
 
She believes that we’re seeing a fracturing of the so called logic of deterrents and it 
is coming to be seen as madness.  
 
She describes all this as her ‘secular work’, however Linda sees the faith 
communities’ work as central too. A group she belongs to is the United Religions 
Initiative that has a global presence and a co-operation circle called Voices for a 
World Free of Nuclear Weapons.  
 
Episcopal Bishop of the whole of California, Bishop E. Swing founded the Initiative 
on the request of the United Nations. So he was very well connected and Heads of 
State and lists of dignitaries are and have been members from the start, including Bill 
Perry a former defence secretary for example.  
 
The United Religions Initiative are mobilizing those influential people from the moral 
standpoint, to push for disarmament, including doing a film and a vigil. 
 
She congratulated us on the street demonstration that we had in the Town Square 
as a wonderful way to deliver public education and develop political will. She also 
recognized Ploughshares’ actions, who fund organizations that promote peace, 

security and work for nuclear disarmament.  
https://www.plough.com/en/topics/justice/nonviolence/blessing-the-bombs 
 
She finished her talk with a powerful quote from the priest who blessed the bombing 
raids in 1945 as part of what he thought was a ‘just war’, but has dedicated the rest 
of his life to campaigning for non violence. Father George Zabelka said “We must all 
become prophets. I really mean that. We must all do something for peace. We must 
stop this insanity of worshiping the gods of metal. We must take a stand against evil 
and idolatry. This is our destiny at the most critical time of human history. But, it is 
also the greatest opportunity ever offered to any group of people in the history of our 
world to save our world from complete annihilation.“ 
 
Linda had emphasized how we must use all our networks, plus individual action and 
the faith communities to move our governments and create the groundswell to make 
it happen – make them sign the treaty. 
 
Rob Forsyth  
Rob Forsyth is a former Polaris Commander, who served in the submarine service 
from 1961 – 1981  
including command of a nuclear-powered attack submarine and teaching the 
Submarine CO’s Command Course. 
 
When introducing himself, Rob described himself to those who didn’t know him, as a 
bit of a ‘cuckoo in the nest’ as he had two years as second in command of a Polaris 
submarine including 2 periods in command. He described how he regrets it and has 
spent his latter years studying the very complex ‘deterrents problem’. He said he is 
now, firmly, not a deterrer!  
 
Rob has a website www.whytrident.uk that explains why he has concluded that the 
UK should give up its nuclear deterrent. 
 
When he set out, he found out so many facts that he didn’t know, which changed his 
mind that he tested them out on people. Dedington is a very blue, Conservative 
territory, full of very strong deterrers but many were surprised by the facts he gave 
them. 
He recommends spreading some real information to counter the misinformation that 
the government puts out. As well as the website, he talks and writes articles for naval 
magazines. 
 
You need to win the battle of politics. People vote with their feet and money moves 
feet. The one thing a politician responds to, is a loss of votes. If people think their 
money is being spent wrongly then they start to think otherwise about voting for a 
party. What you have to do is undermine people’s confidence in the message that 
the government is putting out. 
 
One fact that is good to start with is that the government say all the time that the 
Dreadnought will cost 32 billion, for delivery some time in the 2030s. So they’ve 
given themselves a 10-year window and added a 10 billion contingency, so it’s 
actually 42 billion. There’s another 20 billion at least on the warhead and all the 
ancillary work that we know from Trident. So, actually, 32 billion is actually 60-70 

billion. That’s the first fact people find interesting. 
 
The second fact he poses to people as a question: Do you realize that the 
submarines - on patrol 7 days a week, 365 days a year, keeping you safe - have not 
been targeted for 25 years? There has been no nuclear threat. The missiles are at 
about 3 days notice to fire. This fact causes interest as nobody knows that. The 
information is on a government website but you have to know where to look. He 
continues; if they’re at 3 days’ notice to fire, why are they at sea continually? Why 
are they not operating like another naval ship, coming in to harbour and being 
deployed when there’s a crisis?  
 
He told us how a submarine has just come off patrol having had quite a serious 
Covid problem on board and having to isolate people. He dreads to think how they 
went about that. Before they sailed, they had landed a female sailor who had Covid. 
You have to say, what is the aim? There is no threat, missiles are stood down, no 
nuclear warfare in the offing. No possibility of an instant strike – as we were told 
would happen, back in the Cold War, though he didn’t believe it. The submarine 
could easily have not gone back on patrol.  
 
The third fact he is inclined to deliver is that we’re developing a 20 billion pound 
programme for a new warhead, 90% of which will be American and only 10% will be 
British. So we are spending billions on setting up the Admiralty Weapons 
Establishment (The Admiralty Surface Weapons Establishment is just the defence 
research agency). This also reiterated Bruce Kent’s point that UK nuclear weapons 
are not independent, very few of the parts are British made or owned.   
   
Rob concludes that facts are quite a good way to undermine trust in the government 
and once you can start to undermine trust in the government, then perhaps they’ll 
start to listen to the bigger picture. And if you tell people that both Kennedy and 
Mountbatten, who were both big-featuring people in the nuclear world, were 
convinced that actually nuclear weapons were not the way to go, that is of interest 
too. Rob believes that had Kennedy not died, he would have embarked on a 
disarmament programme. Mountbatten, as well,  in his last years spoke openly in the 
House of Lords about how we should be disarming. 
 
Finally, he suggested we turn to the open letter that ICAN generated. 56 statesmen, 
from 20 NATO countries, 2 NATO Secretary Generals, all are saying Sign the UN 
Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, because the NPT has been in force 
for 58 years and not a single disarmament measure has taken place underneath it. 
(The NPT is the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which entered 
into force in March 1970, seeking to inhibit the spread of nuclear weapons. 
 
The NPT has become the ‘big five’s’ way of lawfully carrying on with nuclear 
weapons as nobody can say it doesn’t say they will get rid of them. They just have a 
way of not doing it. (The big five are the countries with big nuclear weapons power, 
including the UK) who have not yet signed the treaty. 
 
 In conclusion Rob finds that distributing simple facts like this carries quite a lot of 
weight. 
 

Stop the AUKUS partnership, spending and proliferation of nuclear submarines in 
Asian waters. 
Keep AI out of Nuclear Weapons Decisions - Report for the Indonesia Government 
on AUKUS, by Frances 
 “Unrecoverable Error” 
It’s hard to remember what the public used to to be told about nuclear power. We 
knew nuclear reactors were dangerous because the processes of fission and fusion 
require extreme compression and extreme heat; temperatures twice as hot as the 
core of the sun. Sometimes nuclear power stations would “melt-down”, releasing 
radioactive waste. We were told that nuclear waste never degrades. Hundreds of 
millions of cubic metres, of the toxic waste, sit in each country, including Indonesia, 
while ways to store it ‘for longer than expected’ are explored. Sometimes nuclear 
waste was piped to other countries, or dumped little-by-little into the sea. More 
recently, the nuclear industry were in negotiations with gas and oil companies to bury 
the waste in empty wells. In the past, most men and women associated nuclear 
power with war and inevitable mass destruction, by accident or by design. 
Then there was the danger of “a maniac” “pressing the button”, detonating a nuclear 
bomb. We hoped leaders would know of the “nuclear winter” that would follow, where 
nothing will grow and so much radiation in the air would make our hair fall out, and 
quickly humans, along with the other animal and plant life would wither and die. 
People imagined that military personnel would wait nervously for the leader of their 
country to give the command to fire. We hoped the threat of nuclear war would only 
ever escalate following many months and years of peace negotiations, and efforts to 
find other resolutions. If we had thought about using nuclear weapons logically, we 
would have remembered that there is only ever a “4-minute warning”. Four minutes 
is not enough time to ring 
 
 the President, or even discuss with a colleague, so whoever is on duty must rely on 
the notification from that computer system and follow protocol. Military protocol 
requires immediate retaliation. 
This procedure, upon which the safety of the whole world rests, was eventually 
tested: A transmission came in, to an Early Warning data centre, that the US had 
launched six nuclear missiles on Russia. By great chance, a man by the name of 
Stanislav Petrov was on duty. Feeling the responsibility for the action he had to take, 
he recognised he still had a choice. “An erroneous retaliatory nuclear attack on the 
United States and its NATO allies could have wiped out half of the population”. But 
what else did he have, in addition to the computer reports and protocol? He had the 
depth of his experience; his reasoning; his observations of the political landscape; 
his care for life and trust in his own inner authority. Petrov made “a judgement call” 
and decided the reports must be a false alarm. “An investigation later confirmed that 
the satellite warning system had indeed malfunctioned”. 
In the upcoming election debate, candidates should discuss their understanding and 
stance on commercial and military nuclear power and how they will lead with 
discernment and concern for the cost to life. The cost to life is not just if there’s a war 
or disaster. The replacement Trident nuclear submarine for the UK cost the same as 
providing an upgraded National Health Service for free, for the whole population, for 
45 years. Somehow the decision to finance the submarine instead of the National 
Health Service, got passed in their parliament. 
Thankfully, President Joko Widodo already sent a clear message to the world that 
“the possession and use of nuclear weapons cannot be justified for any reason”, 

when he ratified the Treaty Prohibiting Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) in November 
2023. But was Indonesia informed by its “Plenipotentiary ambassadors” abroad 
(These are delegates to foreign countries who have independent, executive powers 
to act on behalf of Indonesia) about the Arkus Partnership between the UK, US and 
Australia; to arm Australia with eight nuclear submarines? China have called the plan 
“a return to a Cold War mentality”. France are calling it a “stab in the back”, as a 
French company was going to manufacture the submarines and Australia had to pay 
France 555 million euro compensation, just to get out of the deal. With that level of 
international bad feeling about the Arkus partnership, only formed in 2021, ministerial 
candidates must ask whether the submarines could make Indonesia more of a 
military target, than act as a ‘deterrent’ - which is what some governments are calling 
nuclear weapons now - or serve on the Pandemic Preparedness fast-response 
supply chain to international health and security crises, where the UN say they would 
like to maximise the use of nuclear submarines. 
Following recent agreements with the US and the upcoming WHO Pandemic Treaty, 
already signed, can Indonesia put the brakes on and say ‘No’ to nuclear weapons in 
Indonesian waters or the use of Indonesian resources to fuel and arm them? The 
submarines, like the other smart technologies are to use artificial intelligence 
extensively in their operation. 
Gladiator Bangsa have also been considering, when did competent authorities, 
regulators and decision- makers start trusting technology and being digitally-
assisted, more than trusting our own experience and knowledge and trusting each 
other? 
 
Most people have sat in front of a computer screen for a lot longer than four minutes, 
in frustration and powerlessness, unable to even verify their own identity to access 
their own accounts. In the past, a computer screen would often read ‘Unrecoverable 
Error”. Imagine the artificial intelligence in these nuclear submarines, executing their 
programmed protocols without hesitation, while the Naval Commander frantically 
tries to get clearance to stop the ballistic missiles being fired. The computer may 
require a retina scan; facial recognition; a finger print, and may an OTP - a One Time 
Password. Picture all these being asked for at once in order to return the computer 
system to manual controls. Too late. “Unrecoverable error”.

Pascal Najadi:  The WEF is not eligible anymore for diplomatic immunity. I call on the 
Swiss authorities and security to arrest those people immediately. 
Pascal Najadi and Dr Astrid Stuckelberger discuss the dark underbelly of global 
organizations headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland. 
“Everything evil in the world related to democide unfortunately comes from Geneva,” 
Najadi says. “You have WHO in Geneva, you have GAVI, then you have the 
WEF…that has diplomatic immunity. 
“I, as a Swiss citizen right here, now declare that the WEF is not eligible anymore for 
diplomatic immunity. I call on the Swiss authorities and security to arrest those 
people immediately.” 
“Why? The WEF, WHO, GAVI, Big Pharma, Big Tech, and Bill Gates all advocated a 
global humanity injection by a bioweapon injecting nanolipids into 5.7 billion people. 
And we Swiss are hosting them. That’s terrible. We cannot tolerate any entity that 
promotes poison to be injected into humanity. But you have done it. I’m the victim. 
I’m dying from it, and my mother, too. It’s a democide and will be judged. It will be 
corrected in the name of humanity.” 
At the beginning of this year, Pascal Najadi, a retired banker from Switzerland filed 
criminal charges of Abuse of Office under Article 310 of the Swiss Criminal Code 
against Swiss President Alain Berset, who was also that country’s former Minister of 
Health. To everyone’s surprise, the Attorney General of Switzerland launched an 
investigation into the President – the first, of a sitting head of state over their 
“vaccine” policies – causing Berset to resign! 
  
Pascal was born in Switzerland and his Swiss mother, Heidi Anderhub-Minger is the 
grandniece of Rudolf Minger, who was the President of Switzerland before World 
War II. Pascal’s father, Hussain Najadi was the renowned Persian-Bahraini 
international banker and business developer who became a founding member of the 
European Management Forum, before he broke off with Klaus Schwab in 1987 and 
the Davos meeting was renamed the World Economic Forum.  
Pascal says his father broke off with Klaus Schwab but he says that the early 
European Management Forum was a small gathering of no more than 100 people 
that was held at a 4-star hotel that he describes as “clever” and “benign”. It was 
basically a schmoozefest for leaders from “emerging markets” mainly in Asia, where 
Hussain had founded banks to develop Middle Eastern capital. In 2013, Hussain was 
fatally shot in Kuala Lumpur, alongside his wife, who was seriously injured. Pascal 

believes his father was assassinated for reporting corruption within Malaysia. 
  
In the meantime, the World Economic Forum was taken over by the same group that 
is pushing Agenda 2030 at the UN, which Pascal calls “The end of humanity.” 
Last February, Pascal said of the International Health Regulations, “Exit the WHO. If 
you can do that, that’s the smartest thing to do. Just exit…It is a Fascist declaration.”

Mokhibe  Resignation Letter - Peace 
https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24103463-craig-mokhiber-resignation-
letter 
HEADQUARTERS | SIEGE | NEW YORK, NY 10017 TEL.: + 212 963 5931 | 
craig.mokhiber@un.org 28 October 2023  
Dear High Commissioner,  
This will be my last official communication to you as Director of the New York Office 
of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.  
 
I write at a moment of great anguish for the world, including for many of our 
colleagues. Once again, we are seeing a genocide unfolding before our eyes, and 
the Organization that we serve appears powerless to stop it. As someone who has 
investigated human rights in Palestine since the 1980s, lived in Gaza as a UN 
human rights advisor in the 1990s, and carried out several human rights missions to 
the country before and since, this is deeply personal to me.  
 
I also worked in these halls through the genocides against the Tutsis, Bosnian 
Muslims, the Yazidi, and the Rohingya. In each case, when the dust settled on the 
horrors that had been perpetrated against defenseless civilian populations, it 
became painfully clear that we had failed in our duty to meet the imperatives of 
prevention of mass atrocites, of protection of the vulnerable, and of accountability for 
perpetrators. And so it has been with successive waves of murder and persecution 
against the Palestinians throughout the entire life of the UN. High Commissioner, we 
are failing again.  
 
As a human rights lawyer with more than three decades of experience in the field, I 
know well that the concept of genocide has often been subject to political abuse. But 
the current wholesale slaughter of the Palestinian people, rooted in an ethno-
nationalist settler colonial ideology, in continuation of decades of their systematic 
persecution and purging, based entirely upon their status as Arabs, and coupled with 
explicit statements of intent by leaders in the Israeli government and military, leaves 
no room for doubt or debate. In Gaza, civilian homes, schools, churches, mosques, 
and medical institutions are wantonly attacked as thousands of civilians are 
massacred. In the West Bank, including occupied Jerusalem, homes are seized and 
reassigned based entirely on race, and violent settler pogroms are accompanied by 
Israeli military units. Across the land, Apartheid rules.  
 
This is a text-book case of genocide. The European, ethno-nationalist, settler 
colonial project in Palestine has entered its final phase, toward the expedited 
destruction of the last remnants of indigenous Palestinian life in Palestine. What’s 

more, the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, and much of 
Europe, are wholly complicit in the horrific assault. Not only are these governments 
refusing to meet their treaty obligations “to ensure respect” for the Geneva 
Conventions, but they are in fact actively arming the assault, providing economic and 
intelligence support, and giving political and diplomatic cover for Israel’s atrocities.

Craig Mokhibe - Human Rights Lawyer continues: 
 
 In concert with this, western corporate media, increasingly captured and state-
adjacent, are in open breach of Article 20 of the ICCPR, continuously dehumanizing 
Palestinians to facilitate the genocide, and broadcasting propaganda for war and 
advocacy of national, racial, or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to 
discrimination, hostility, and violence. US-based social media companies are 
suppressing the voices of human rights defenders while amplifying pro-Israel 
propaganda. Israel lobby online-trolls and GONGOS are harassing and smearing 
human rights defenders, and western universities and employers are collaborating 
with them to punish those who dare to speak out against the atrocities. In the wake 
of this genocide, there must be an accounting for these actors as well, just as there 
was for radio Milles Collines in Rwanda.  
 
In such circumstances, the demands on our organization for principled and effective 
action are greater than ever. But we have not met the challenge. The protective 
enforcement power Security Council has again been blocked by US intransigence, 
the SG is under assault for the mildest of protestations, and our human rights 
mechanisms are under sustained slanderous attack by an organized, online impunity 
network. Decades of distraction by the illusory and largely disingenuous promises of 
Oslo have diverted the Organization from its core duty to defend international law, 
international human rights, and the Charter itself. The mantra of the “two-state 
solution” has become an open joke in the corridors of the UN, both for its utter 
impossibility in fact, and for its total failure to account for the inalienable human rights 
of the Palestinian people. The so-called “Quartet” has become nothing more than a 
fig leaf for inaction and for subservience to a brutal status quo. The (US-scripted) 
deference to “agreements between the parties themselves” (in place of international 
law) was always a transparent slight-of-hand, designed to reinforce the power of 
Israel over the rights of the occupied and dispossessed Palestinians.  
 
High Commissioner, I came to this Organization first in the 1980s, because I found in 
it a principled, norm- based institution that was squarely on the side of human rights, 
including in cases where the powerful US, UK, and Europe were not on our side. 
While my own government, its subsidiarity institutions, and much of the US media 
were still supporting or justifying South African apartheid, Israeli oppression, and 
Central American death squads, the UN was standing up for the oppressed peoples 
of those lands. We had international law on our side. We had human rights on our 
side. We had principle on our side. Our authority was rooted in our integrity. But no 
more.  
 

In recent decades, key parts of the UN have surrendered to the power of the US, 
and to fear of the Israel Lobby, to abandon these principles, and to retreat from 
international law itself. We have lost a lot in this abandonment, not least our own 
global credibility. But the Palestinian people have sustained the biggest losses as a 
result of our failures. It is a stunning historic irony that the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights was adopted in the same year that the Nakba was perpetrated 
against the Palestinian people. As we commemorate the 75th Anniversary of the 
UDHR, we would do well to abandon the old cliché that the UDHR was born out of 
the atrocities that proceeded it, and to admit that it was born alongside one of the 
most atrocious genocides of the 20th Century, that of the destruction of Palestine. In 
some sense, the framers were promising human rights to everyone, except the 
Palestinian people. And let us remember as well, that the UN itself carries the 
original sin of helping to facilitate the dispossession of the Palestinian people by 
ratifying the European settler colonial project that seized Palestinian land and turned 
it over to the colonists. We have much for which to atone.  
 
But the path to atonement is clear. We have much to learn from the principled stance 
taken in cities around the world in recent days, as masses of people stand up 
against the genocide, even at risk of beatings and arrest. Palestinians and their 
allies, human rights defenders of every stripe, Christian and Muslim organizations, 
and progressive Jewish voices saying “not in our name”, are all leading the way. All 
we have to do is to follow them. 
 
UNITED NATIONS | PAGE 3  
 
Yesterday, just a few blocks from here, New York’s Grand Central Station was 
completely taken over by thousands of Jewish human rights defenders standing in 
solidarity with the Palestinian people and demanding an end to Israeli tyranny (many 
risking arrest, in the process). In doing so, they stripped away in an instant the Israeli 
hasbara propaganda point (and old antisemitic trope) that Israel somehow 
represents the Jewish people. It does not. And, as such, Israel is solely responsible 
for its crimes. On this point, it bears repeating, in spite of Israel lobby smears to the 
contrary, that criticism of Israel’s human rights violations is not antisemitic, any more 
than criticism of Saudi violations is Islamophobic, criticism of Myanmar violations is 
anti-Buddhist, or criticism of Indian violations is anti-Hindu. When they seek to 
silence us with smears, we must raise our voice, not lower it. I trust you will agree, 
High Commissioner, that this is what speaking truth to power is all about. But I also 
find hope in those parts of the UN that have refused to compromise the 
Organization’s human rights principles in spite of enormous pressures to do so. Our 
independent special rapporteurs, commissions of enquiry, and treaty body experts, 
alongside most of our staff, have continued to stand up for the human rights of the 
Palestinian people, even as other parts of the UN (even at the highest levels) have 
shamefully bowed their heads to power. As the custodians of the human rights 
norms and standards, OHCHR has a particular duty to defend those standards. Our 
job, I believe, is to make our voice heard, from the Secretary- General to the newest 
UN recruit, and horizontally across the wider UN system, insisting that the human 
rights of the Palestinian people are not up for debate, negotiation, or compromise 
anywhere under the blue flag. What, then, would a UN-norm-based position look 
like? For what would we work if we were true to our rhetorical admonitions about 
human rights and equality for all, accountability for perpetrators, redress for victims, 

protection of the vulnerable, and empowerment for rights-holders, all under the rule 
of law? The answer, I believe, is simple—if we have the clarity to see beyond the 
propagandistic smokescreens that distort the vision of justice to which we are sworn, 
the courage to abandon fear and deference to powerful states, and the will to truly 
take up the banner of human rights and peace. To be sure, this is a long-term project 
and a steep climb. But we must begin now or surrender to unspeakable horror. I see 
ten essential points:  
 
Legitimate action: First, we in the UN must abandon the failed (and largely 
disingenuous) Oslo paradigm, its illusory two-state solution, its impotent and 
complicit Quartet, and its subjugation of international law to the dictates of presumed 
political expediency. Our positions must be unapologetically based on international 
human rights and international law.  
Clarity of Vision: We must stop the pretense that this is simply a conflict over land or 
religion between two warring parties and admit the reality of the situation in which a 
disproportionately powerful state is colonizing, persecuting, and dispossessing an 
indigenous population on the basis of their ethnicity.  
 
One State based on human rights: We must support the establishment of a single, 
democratic, secular state in all of historic Palestine, with equal rights for Christians, 
Muslims, and Jews, and, therefore, the dismantling of the deeply racist, settler-
colonial project and an end to apartheid across the land.  
 
Fighting Apartheid: We must redirect all UN efforts and resources to the struggle 
against apartheid, just as we did for South Africa in the 1970s, 80s, and early 90s.  
Return and Compensation: We must reaffirm and insist on the right to return and full 
compensation for all Palestinians and their families currently living in the occupied 
territories, in Lebanon, Jordan, Syria, and in the diaspora across the globe. 
 
Truth and Justice: We must call for a transitional justice process, making full use of 
decades of accumulated UN investigations, enquiries, and reports, to document the 
truth, and to ensure accountability for all perpetrators, redress for all victims, and 
remedies for documented injustices.  
 
Protection: We must press for the deployment of a well-resourced and strongly 
mandated UN protection force with a sustained mandate to protect civilians from the 
river to the sea.  
 
Disarmament: We must advocate for the removal and destruction of Israel’s massive 
stockpiles of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, lest the conflict lead to the 
total destruction of the region and, possibly, beyond.  
 
Mediation: We must recognize that the US and other western powers are in fact not 
credible mediators, but rather actual parties to the conflict who are complicit with 
Israel in the violation of Palestinian rights, and we must engage them as such.  
 
Solidarity: We must open our doors (and the doors of the SG) wide to the legions of 
Palestinian, Israeli, Jewish, Muslim, and Christian human rights defenders who are 
standing in solidarity with the people of Palestine and their human rights and stop the 
unconstrained flow of Israel lobbyists to the offices of UN leaders, where they 

advocate for continued war, persecution, apartheid, and impunity, and smear our 
human rights defenders for their principled defense of Palestinian rights.  
 
This will take years to achieve, and western powers will fight us every step of the 
way, so we must be steadfast. In the immediate term, we must work for an 
immediate ceasefire and an end to the longstanding siege on Gaza, stand up against 
the ethnic cleansing of Gaza, Jerusalem, and the West Bank (and elsewhere), 
document the genocidal assault in Gaza, help to bring massive humanitarian aid and 
reconstruction to the Palestinians, take care of our traumatized colleagues and their 
families, and fight like hell for a principled approach in the UN’s political offices.  
 
The UN’s failure in Palestine thus far is not a reason for us to withdraw. Rather it 
should give us the courage to abandon the failed paradigm of the past, and fully 
embrace a more principled course. Let us, as OHCHR, boldly and proudly join the 
anti-apartheid movement that is growing all around the world, adding our logo to the 
banner of equality and human rights for the Palestinian people. The world is 
watching. We will all be accountable for where we stood at this crucial moment in 
history. Let us stand on the side of justice. I thank you, High Commissioner, Volker, 
for hearing this final appeal from my desk. I will leave the Office in a few days for the 
last time, after more than three decades of service. But please do not hesitate to 
reach out if I can be of assistance in the future. Sincerely, Craig Mokhiber

19. Estonia reject the COP28 financing, as well as IHR Amendments and Treaty 

Estonian Parliament Rejects the financing of the WHO, as well as their Amendments 
to the International health Regulations and the International Agreement on Pandemic 
Prevention, Preparedness and Response  
On November 22nd, 2023, eleven members of the Estonian Parliament sent a letter 
to the WHO Director General providing notification of Estonia’s rejection of the 
International Health Regulation (2005) Amendments, as well as the International 
Agreement on Pandemic Prevention, Preparedness, and Response. They also noted 
they rejected changes to financing of the WHO.  They note that the full Estonian 
Parliament did not authorize such negotiations, as required by Estonian law.

Lawyer Eddie Hobbs,: the Treaty cannot be accepted in Ireland.  
Crotty  personally took the government to court and ruled that cooperation on foreign 
policy could not be codified into law as it would amount to an unconstitutional 
delegation of the state’s external sovereignty 
 Crotty v. An Taoiseach was a landmark 1987 decision of the Irish Supreme Court 
which found that Ireland could not ratify the Single European Act unless the Irish 
Constitution was first changed to permit its ratification. The case, taken by Raymond 
Crotty formally against the Taoiseach (then Garret FitzGerald), directly led to the 
Tenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland (which authorised the ratification of 
the Single Act) and established that significant changes to European Union treaties 
required an amendment to the Irish constitution before they could be ratified by 
Ireland. As a consequence, Ireland, uniquely in the EU, requires a plebiscite for 
every new, or substantive change to a, European Union Treaty. 
The substantive issues in the case revolved around the interpretation of Part III of 
the Single European Act which codified cooperation on foreign policy matters 
between the governments of the then twelve member states of the European 
Economic Community – referred to as European Political Cooperation – into an 
international agreement. The majority of the Court ruled that if the state ratified Part 
III, it would amount to an unconstitutional delegation of the state's external 
sovereignty. The dissenting judges argued that the provisions only constituted a 
requirement to listen and consult.

Vaccine deaths and fraudulent misrepresentation 
In a ruling  under the UK’s code of conduct Pfizer has been found GUILTY of 
‘bringing discredit to the pharmaceutical industry’ in the UK, the most serious breach 
there is under the UK Code of Practice rules.   
 A ruling by the UK’s @PMCPAUK ound pfizer had breached the UK’s regulatory 
code of conduct FIVE times including misleading the public about the safety and 
efficacy of its Covid vaccine AND unlawfully promoting an unlicensed medicine.  
This comes after Pfizer was found GUILTY in November 2022 of misleading UK 
parents over the safety of the Covid vaccine for kids.

Cases against Artificial Intelligence and Patents 
Bill Gates AI technology secretly smuggled into the billions of mosquitoes 
engineered to carry the Wolbachia Bacteria IP Technology. The capacity is unknown 
but at very least can transmit data as to where the mosquitoes are, who they bite 
and can receive instructions too, including electrical pulse-relayed genetic 

modification and directions, activations, and a kill switch, all operated through the 5G 
network and smart infrastructure. Outside Indonesia’s control. AI also mapped the 
deployment of the eggs and was used to produce a risk assessment that concluded 
negligible risk for over 50 risks that were all guaranteed to be a high risk and 
guaranteed to happen. 
Artificial Intelligence is a military technology, that follows a retaliatory protocol.  
Following requests for due diligence, before the release of 200 million vectors 
carrying Wolbachia IP Technology coupled with Microsoft CNN AI ,in Indonesia, we 
achieved a postponement on the WHO-approved release. That same night an 
Indonesian maternity Hospital, in Gaza was bombed and destroyed. Then I 
discovered that the

Through the upcoming WHO's Pandemic Treaty, and Sustainability treaties, 
Microsoft AI will seize control of all data and exercise a heinous credit-scoring 
surveillance but mainly bring Bill Gates’ patents to fruition. Exclusive rights to the 
Computerisation of the Human Body and all energy derived from it. All the patents 
and licenses have to be revoked and the technologies contained and destroyed or 
decommissioned.  
Microsoft laid off their entire Ethics team, employed to ensure good practice in the 
implementation of artificial intelligence.. over 10,000 were sacked and not replaced. 
Microsoft has offered to pay all legal costs arising for their Artificial Intelligence 
customers. Microsoft will protect their customers from being sued however 
evidenced and extensive the infringement is.   
 
Artificial intelligence employed to generate thousands of targets, by using data 
gathered from people’s social media interests.   
1. President Obama changed strike targets from actual terrorist targets to 'signature 
groups', allowing any man woman or child with sympathy for the occupied nation or 
having lost a friend in the violence to become a legitimate target themselves.   
2. Drones were brought to Djbouti in 2010 for stirkes in the Yemen.

b) Analysis of The Sex Matters Bill as Crucial For Peace by Frances sent March

“Please support the Bill forbidding the social transitioning in school of children from 
boys to girls and girls to boys. The Bill thankfully further demands that no child is 
given puberty blockers or hormonal treatment (irreversible or otherwise-promoted) or 
surgery to change their sex. You can support the Bill by joining the debate tomorrow. 
I have also sent this to the Mayor of Abingdon, a member of Mayors for Peace. This 

is because the  sterilzing of children, by a foreign entity, however it is achieved, is a 
crime. (https://infertilitymovie.org/ This is how they're doing it in Africa. (The 
Diabolical Agenda case of sterilising a whole population with vaccines administered

Social and Genetic Engineering. Allowing the social and genetic engineering of 
children is part of a wider war against men and women. Many children experience 
mortification and shame about their bodies and question the value of who they are, 
as they are, when they go through puberty and beyond. That is an emotional and 
mental response to failures of our education and society. We would go as far as to 
say that they were not even failures, but a premeditated and protracted attack on 
humanity, deployed by foreign and novel technologies. Please explain at the debate 
that it is a crime to exploit this vulnerable age group by validating the self-rejection of 
the healthy body they are born with.

To represent peaceful men and women in your constituency please raise the context 
of this bill, where the rollout of MMWave and 5G towers (and Elon Musk's satellite 
capacity)  with an artificial intelligence interface is happening, without public 
consultation, consent or even planning permission. We do not consent. The capacity 
of this wifi technology and so-called smart infrastructure is to further 'groom' the next 
generation for exploitation. It is a radiological weapon of mass destruction. The 
internet triggers a permanent adrenalin response and intentionally spreads fear and 
a narrative devoid of emotional intelligence and truth. Following a Freedom of 
Information request into the safety of the 5G infrastructure and shortwave frequency 
before the rollout, I received only one sentence. “WHO says it’s safe”

The neurotoxin fluoridation also must not be allowed into the water supply in Great

Men and women stand above public servants, government and obviously above 
corporations, in Constitiutonal law and we ask you to make sure we and our bodily 
integrity are not undermined further. 
The updated version of the WHO and UN Treaties were not shared but leaked to the 
public. You may not have time to read them, and they are still being amended and so 
remain a ‘moving target’ in terms of meaningful analysis. You will have to trust these 
cases for appeal that they will bring carnage if nations aquiesce, via their “silent 
process”. In fact, nations haven’t kept silent at all but still the threats of profitable 

protracted crises (Declarations of pandemics that never end), lockdowns, forced 
medical procedures and surveillance down to biological data collection and 
replication, could still be written into legally binding agreements, unless we speak up 
and make the UN and WHO step down.  
 
c) This was my communication with the South African firm of lawyers who have filed 
charges against the UK, US and Israel governments, for War Crimes.  
In retaliation, the US have put sanctions on South Africa for filing these charges. All 
these hostile actions can still be defused and refused but not if the WHO come into 
power in May. 
The WHO will also put sanctions on member states if they do not comply with the 
agreement in terms of reporting on their surveillance of the people, and the 
purchase, mandating and administering of drugs. 
 
Most people know that the reported Hammas attacks were likely a psychological 
operation again, using AI to generate an event that would justify the involvement of 
US and UK in the bombardment of Palestine.  
The men and women of Great Britain do not agree or consent to the actions of the 
Corporation of the United Kingdom on any front and intend for our children to grow 
up with freedom of choice and sovereignty. 
The AI machine directing Israel’s bombing spree in Gaza 
The Israeli army has marked tens of thousands of Gazans as suspects for 
assassination, using an AI targeting system with little human oversight and a 
permissive policy for casualties, In 2021, a book titled “The Human-Machine Team: 
How to Create Synergy Between Human and Artificial Intelligence That Will 
Revolutionize Our World” was released in English under the pen name “Brigadier 
General Y.S.” In it, the author — a man who we confirmed to be the current 
commander of the elite Israeli intelligence unit 8200 — makes the case for designing 
a special machine that could rapidly process massive amounts of data to generate 
thousands of potential “targets” for military strikes in the heat of a war. Such 
technology, he writes, would resolve what he described as a “human bottleneck for 
both locating the new targets and decision-making to approve the targets.”

also hid a deadly pathogen from the WHO and refused to share samples. It was 
gone when got out of prison. When she was finally able to track it down, it was in

American-funded military laboratories there.

United Nations double agents. Herding women and children into schools for

The exhibition clearly showed the consequences of the attack on Gaza last year. 
The first half consisted of striking cell phone photos from 
many people in schoolyards with hundreds of phosphorous rays landing everywhere. 
The second half was an exhibition of drawings made by surviving children 
as part of a project aimed at remedying the mental trauma suffered. 
 
Gaza was bombed from December 27, 2008 to January 18, 2009. The UN then 
offered their schools as refuge to the Palestinians but the UN 
informed the Israelis. This made schools a target and hundreds of children and entire 
families were killed. Eighteen schools were fully 
destroyed, two hundred and fifty schools bombed. 
The two types of bombs used were both developed by the United States and given 
to Israel for testing. 
White phosphorus bombs rained down on large areas, burning whatever they landed 
on. New technology adding gel to the composition of the bombs meant that they 
remained lit and burned people as they tried to escape. Phosphorus fallout also 
reignites, making the place unsafe for days. Anyway, there was nowhere to go -  
the entire area is only 7 miles by 22 miles. 
 
The second type of bomb has been described as genotoxic. Thousands of toxic 
metal rods break off and remain in the body undetected. They are invisible to the 
naked eye  
cannot be removed. Their toxicity will cause cancer and cancer in the next 
generation. 
 

The drawings showed more destruction. Several showed bulldozers destroying 
apartments full of people. Many showed that the attack was carried out 
by machines rather than soldiers. Drones were used - remotely controlled bombers, 
operated from the base camp. The observations written alongside these images 
included a question aimed at children. “Should people be allowed to kill real people 
with a video game?   
Some school groups were also present 
at the exhibition, with one of them drawing pictures in response to the images in the 
exhibition. An older foreign group studied the exhibits. Some of our fellow Fas Lane  
protesters had put together the exhibit with a man who had worked with Palestinian 
children for years, originally trying to create a soccer team and program 
exchange with Great Britain. He was also there in March last year to carry out the art 
therapy project with the young survivors. All photos were both 
beautiful and horrible. There was no hatred but a lot of blood, tears, bombs, houses 
destroyed and symbols of Gaza as a whole destroyed. 
 
Since the exhibition, I have heard on the radio that a British brigadier had been 
reprimanded for his role in the tragedy, linked to the bombing of a UN ship. 
warehouse. It was said only last week that the Israelis had finally admitted to the use 
of white phosphorous bombs. We fear that the 
the bombings will have marked another generation of fear and hatred. From the 
photos it looked like fear and grief, yes, but hatred, no. Perhaps this is 
something that will follow though.

24. Thailand: Doctors file a case of concealment of data rather than investigate novel 
regimens. 
Thai Medical Experts Issue 7-Point Statement Concerning Long COVID & Vax 
Injuries, Point to Public Health Concealment of Data 
January 17 2024 
In what can be described as a medical bombshell revelation--well-respected 
academic medical experts in Thailand employed at the nation’s number one 
academic medical center and a separate respected research university -- raise the 
alarm about the implications of both long COVID and COVID-19 vaccination-related 
injury (long VAX) via a seven-point statement. Of serious concern are the 
implications of the observations and data from a study pointing to disturbing 
observations of cardiorespiratory, neuropsychiatric, neuromuscular and pro-
inflammatory conditions linked to both instances of long COVID-19 and symptoms 
arising from  COVID-19 countermeasures (vaccines). Ominously, the statement’s 
authors have gone on the record that the government continues to conceal the 
adverse impacts of the COVID-19 vaccines. With the recently announced statement, 
the authors also announce a research collaboration between Chulalongkorn 
University and Rangsit University College of Oriental Medicine, the formation of a 
network to collect, collate and study patient data linked to long COVID and long Vax. 
The goal, to better understand the underlying unfolding medical problems, leveraging 
existing medical treatments, investigate novel regimens and even embrace 
alternative courses, such as Traditional Chinese and Traditional Thai medicine. 
 
A highly regarded neurologist-scientist, Prof Dr Thiravat Hemachudha, director of the 
Thai Red Cross Emerging Infectious Diseases Health Science Centre at 
Chulalongkorn University, among other accomplishments establishing a World 
Health Organization research unit at a major Thai hospital, along with Panthep 
Puapongphan, dean of Rangsit University’s College of Oriental Medicine, and a 
psychiatrist on the Chulalongkorn University Faculty of Medicine Dr. Atapol 
Sughondhabirom issued an ominous joint statement—a call to action to healthcare 
professionals. Their concern? The accumulation of their observations, manifestation 
of hidden disease, weakened immunity as potential pathway to neurological 
disorders and even cancer as well as shining light on nefarious efforts to conceal 
public health data as to the true volume of people across Thailand facing health 
issues linked to either long COVID or the COVID-19 vaccines. 
 
In this case, the WHO’s own Constitution says that Amendments must be circulated 
at least 4 months before voting. And the 80 pages of the International Health 
Amendments giving “aggregious powers to force vaccinations, force medical 
procedures, force lockdowns and border closures and allow detention without due 
process”, are still being worked out, FOI 4941 revealed. 

 
25. “Banking is slightly illegal,” says world-renowned economist Richard Werner, 
who is leading the charge against CBDCs. In this episode of "The Glenn Beck 
Podcast," Richard teaches Glenn that “banks don’t take deposits, and banks don’t 
lend money.” That begs the question, “What do banks actually do?” This discussion 
may make you realize that all you think you know about money is wrong. That’s not 
all we don’t know about the economy. We also have no clue which banks make up 
the Federal Reserve, who created Bitcoin, or the real relationship between inflation 
and interest rates. But we do know that COVID-19 revealed a global concentration of 
power and probably paved the way for the tool dictators of old could have only 
dreamt of: CBDC. Before the appeal of Universal Basic Income lures you into 
implanting a chip under your skin, it may be time to consider whether or not America 
should follow the China-inspired path to one central bank. Perhaps, it’s time to 
consider what Glenn says about the central planners of our economy: “You’re in 
Vegas, and the house always wins.” 
 
 
20th April 2024 Supplementary Evidence Submission to the Court regarding the 
Jurisdiction and Patents. 
This notice is in relation to count 15 in the application for appeal: The exploitation of 
animals and use of so-called animal "by-products": 
 
I am grateful to the honourable court for considering the appeal entered against the 
men and women acting as directors, delegates, and agents of the WHO, UN and 
WEF.  
 
 The following supplementary evidence, of legal proceedings, supports the claim that 
the appeal should extend beyond genocide to faunicide (the killing of animals) and 
ecocide (wilful destruction of the  environment). 
 
Jurisdiction 
I write on behalf of the men and women and all sentient beings that have not been 
able to hold corporations, governments or even individual humans accountable 
through lawful, legal or political process or through public censure; who cannot 
donate, and cannot take up arms or mount an organized, collective campaign of self-
defense. 
 
Please add to count 15 that the treatment of animals is "not in consonance with 
constitutional values". I ask that the first remedy provided by the Federal Supreme 
court establishes jurisdiction, freedoms and dignity for land-animals, pollinators, birds 
and aquatic life, as well as men and women. It must be made clear that we are 
above corporations and above public servants. 
 
We ask for an end to the slaughter, breeding, engineering, confinement, isolation, 
force-feeding, intensive keep, Halal or other methods of killing, hunting, testing, 
vivisection, dissection, poisoning, experimentation, modifying, enhancing, neglecting, 
gene editing, consuming or selling of animal-based ingredients.  
 
We ask the court to formally recognize the substantial equivalence of the "live 
export" of farm animals to countries where they are not protected by any laws, to the 

displacement and replacement of whole human populations to nations where they 
hold no legal status and no recourse to protection.  
 
Contesting Patent Court Decisions 
Thousands of patents have been allowed that should not have been allowed. The 
jurisdiction, bodily integrity, privacy, rights and dignity of de jure men and women and 
all natural creations have been over-ridden by the patent laws and patent courts.  
 
We rigorously contest the legality of patenting 'Exclusive Rights to the 
Computerization of the Human Body' and all  energy generated there-from, by Bill 
Gates.  
 
We strongly contest the Wolbachia IP Technology coupled with Microsoft CNN AI 
patented by Scott O'Neill of the World Mosquito Program, which claims exclusive 
rights to all digital equipment - including the mosquitoes themselves and all data 
generated. The patent has apparently meant that the implementers have not had to 
disclose the presence of the surveillance technology in the mosquitoes, or accept 
liability for the mass deployment of novel biological organisms.  
 
We strongly contest the legal basis for private patenting of pharmaceutical, military, 
agriculture, pesticide, or conservation products, when the research and trials for 
those products have been justified and funded by the public. This is particularly of 
concern with 'dual function' research of concern, where biological agents and their 
gene sequences are withheld in case they are misused. It is the military and 
pharmaceutical companies themselves that have weaponized technology. The 
patents ensure that no independent testing of safety, efficacy or spread are possible. 
 
 The Covid 19 vaccines were the first ever drugs to be allowed on to the market 
without their active ingredients being in the public domain. 
 
We strongly contest the genetic modification of any animal or plant-life and demand 
compensation in all countries for the contamination of their food and water supply, 
and degraded quality of life, as a result  
 
Permanent Suspension. 
Requested remedy of the court - Suspend the use of chemical, synthetic and 
engineered products.  
 
We anticipate compensation that will support tillage and horticultural food producers 
and larger land owners in making their land more productive, with orchards  and 
mixed crops. It will provide a return to the principle that food is medicine. This is a 
process used by the Organic Trust and other Organic Agriculture regulators: The 
principle is that it takes just six years once the synthetic and chemical products are 
stopped, for their residue to disappear fully from the soil. 
 
During the six years, labeling can reflect this transition and subsidies support the 
purchase of 'heritage' seeds while treated, patented and gene edited seeds are 
taken out of circulation, and heirloom varieties,  biodiversity and soil fertility are 
restored.  
 

 Intensive farms will have to be de-commissioned and herds rehomed for the 
remainder of their lives. 
 
We need the court to insist on an immediate ban on the use of chemicals and novel 
technologies.  
 
Proposed Biobanks 
Please emphasize that the people do not consent to the collection of genetic 
samples, of blood or other bodily fluids for replication. 
 
We would appreciate a definitive decision from your honourable court, against a 
Universal Patent Court in France; A universal patent court is proposed, instead of 
legal proceedings remaining in their individual nations within Europe, retaining their 
own patent court and protecting the intellectual property, research, creativity and 
inventions of their own people. We hope the appeal will  clarify if the patent courts 
are Common Law courts, as the paperwork suggests. Will this give patent-holders 
both private and corporate  exemption from liability for their products? Will patents on 
not-for-profit products be protected?  
 
Partial Remedy - One Health Experiment's Control Group 
So far, there has been no control group for any of the experimental permits awarded. 
Even the placeboes in vaccine trials have contained the majority of active ingredients 
of the actual vaccine administered to the other trial group. 
 
If Member States can only get a partial remedy, it would be to be awarded the role, 
by your honourable court, of the experiment's "Control Group". 
Instead of 'An absolute non-questionable leadership in all health matters" being 
forced on the whole world. The experiment could be conducted on the UN 
Headquarters in Switzerland and the United States, as both nations are keen to have 
it.  
 
All the other member states will live by their national constitutions and record their 
nation's return to health and prosperity, in their own terms, using the funds retrieved 
from the defendants and public funds saved from use for terrorism, by the 
governments and military that will have to step down.  
 
This would involve the cease and desist of the aerosol chemical trails deployed by 
airoplanes, disruptive weather modification, the decommissioning of the surveillance, 
wifi, smart infrastructure, the seizing of assets from military and fraudulent public 
servants' control and their disbursement to people. The decommissioning of all 
laboratories inside and outside educational facilities and a funding criteria, lending 
criteria, and building permissions be established in line with the new economic 
strategy developed by Humane Party https://humaneherald.org/wp-
content/uploads/2019/05/calories-and-protein-produced-per-acre-1.pdf and through 
public banks for localized wealth and ensure people are the beneficiaries of their 
own nation's resources and their own labour and inspiration.

%20Public,Public%20Banking%20System%20to%20Ireland.  
 
I bring to your attention the following court proceedings and our calls for a 

referendum. 
1) The New York court decision in 2021 that Chimpanzees are not people. This 
protected researchers from being required to retire chimpanzees after decades of 
experimentation, to sanctuaries. Even though the chimpanizee was shown to have a 
command of language and showed empathy and other observable sentience. 
Response was that apes cannot contribute to society or suffer legal consequences of 
their actions. 
2) National Pork Producers Council (NPPC) and American Farm Bureau Federation 
(AFBF) sued the government for Prop 12 that protected animals, in 2019, claiming 
Prop 12 violates the Commerce Clause of the US Constitution. They did not win but 
farmed animals still do not have space to turn around, nuruture their young or see 
daylight. 
3)  6 Mar 2020 The largest foie gras (force-feeding of ducks until their livers explode) 
producer in Hungary sued Ndgy Mancs Foundation for violating its reputation and for 
damages. 
4) Live Transport of calves to other countries for slaughter outside regulations, or for 
keeping for veal. 
5) Case against the Minister for Agriculture, SImon Coveney, and Queallys 2015; 
fraud and non compliance in their meat plants. 
6) Guinness moved to vegan production from filtering through fish bladders. All Irish 
hop growers (the base ingredient of Guinness) were allowed to plant their crops and 
be told less that a week later that Guinness would not buy their crops as there were 
fewer sales as a result of the lockdown.  
7) Bullfighting was at last outlawed in Spain, only then it came to light that it was 
subsidized with public money to the tune of millions of euro. 
110 million Euro in subsidies from the EU for Bull Fighting 
8) All traditional herbs, medicines, supplements, and other products were banned 
unless they are tested on animals again, even though their safety and efficacy had 
been established for hundreds of years. Making it impossible to source traditional 
medicines was orchestrated by the pharmaceutical companies wanting a monopoly 
on the health market and was severely exacerbated during the pandemic.   
The 'continuum of testing' on established products is an unnecessary cruelty for 
laboratory's profit. 
9) Hare coursing, which is banned because of its cruelty in most countries, is allowed 
in Ireland. MEP Clare Daly discovered hare coursing has also been subsidized 
yearly by more than a hundred thousand euro, of Irish tax payers' money.  
10) No welfare provision in Agricultural Minister's Horse Racing Bill, despite 
considerable pressure to enter some. 
11) The crushing alive of one-day -old male chicks (Chick culling) ban in Germany 
but nowhere else.  
12) Non-compliance in Charles River vivisection laboratories. 600 cats and dogs 
undergoing the most painful toxicity experiments until they are dead. 
13) Super trawlers, banned in Australia, are allowed to fish indiscriminately in Irish 
Waters. The super trawlers have nets the size of two football pitches, sonar to 
identify every shoal and catch them, fishing on a Lithuanian quota, but owned by 
someone in Holland.Boats with freezers that can carry 15 tonnes. No regulation to 
stop smaller fish are not thrown back dead, creating dead zones with no fish. 
14) GMO farmed fish and all other digestive-enzyme-destroying GMO food 
ingredient has been challenged by the Institute For Responsible Technology. 
 

Compensate the existing animal and other charities to the extent that land recovered 
from irresponsible technology - GMO foods, productive land wrongly re-zoned for 
solar, wind and military purposes - to be donated for sanctuaries, with human and 
animal food production supported in the strategy.  
 
There has not been the opportunity to participate in court proceedings  
but some possible Constitutional Amendments have been articulated: Democracy 
Amendment (2015), Equal Rights Amendment 2 (2015), and Abolition Amendment 
(2016). Having this language in final form provides a very clear goal around which 
the court  could facilitate a complete recovery of the sanctity of the life. And the 
Appeal decision could help with the final language needed for the Fiscal 
Responsibility Amendment 
 
15). A ban (following its 5 year wind down period) on caging female pigs, but only in 
Australia. Few know that in Ireland and everywhere else most sows live permanently 
in crates so small that they cannot turn around. They are inseminated where they 
stand and cannot help their piglets when they arrive - every 4 months.  
 
The public were able to postpone, briefly, the new factory farms planned.  
 
16). All public contracts are awarded to corporations, instead of qualified smaller 
organizations because tenders have a clause that requires that an applicant already 
manages a budget and contracts of equal size. There is no way for not for profit 
organizations to expand their charitable offering, if they have been donations-based 
up until the public contract was tendered.  
 
17) Two animal welfare organizations were refuse the management of County dog 
pounds and the contract was awarded to a company who dispose of fallen farm 
animals and were registered in Riga, Latvia at the biggest animal body parts factory 
in the world. A newspaper article was allowed, which would have been censored 
now, and the directors of the company backed out of the contract, demonstrating that 
the extent of their operation was threatened with exposure. 
 
18. Fur farming has not been banned yet, The most recent country gave a 10 year 
wind-down period - within which it is anticipated that 50 million more mink will be 
killed.  Fur Farming Stats and Information - Fur farming is banned across the UK but 
Ireland still has fur farms as horrific as any from the past. Mink are semi-aquatic wild 
animals each family holding an average territory of 2.5km of riverbank in the wild. In 
the farms, they are skinned even when still conscious. 
 
19. A Govegan Poster Campaign contributed to a drop in turkey sales one year but 
the defendants have hijacked the vegan supply chain and the Impossible Burger, for 
example, contains over 40 gene-edited ingredients.  
 
20. The World Health Organization defendants have reported that processed meat is 
carcinogenic, because of 1. the chemicals involved in processing meat 2.  the 
antibiotics used in confined farming methods and 3. the chemicals sprayed on the 
grain and grazing the animals eat. They all find their way into the food chain. Now 
the WHO's pandemic preparedness agreement condones a constant increase in 
antibiotic resistance through their genetic engineering of pandemic response 

pharmaceuticals. We appeal to the honourable court to suspend all activities of the 
defendants with immediate effect. 
 
21. The 'Kill-counter' website shows that aproximately 200,000 tonnes of animals 
killed per month - sheep, pigs and cows. 
Farm Animal Slaughter Statistics UK 
 
22. Puppy farms raided and exposed in Myshall Carlow were found to have several 
hundred more bitches than they had licenses to keep. The owner famously is quoted  
as saying in response to neglect charges "They don't need eyes to pump out 
puppies" The local court planned to return his breeding license but there were too 
many people demonstrating outside the courthouse.  
 
23. Puppy farmers' profits and neglect were protected by the government when the 
DSPCA (Society for the protection of animals) had to pay for the dogs they seized at 
Dublin Airport. 
 
24. New puppy farms have got licenses, including Mayo where the beagles are to be 
bred purely for use in laboratories. 
Charles River Laboratories' Experiments a US company breeds and buys stray 
animals for a "continuum of product development and tests". We do not consent to 
the corporations or their practices.  
 
25. 820,000 animals a year suffer in laboratories in Eire (Ireland). 80% for 
commercial product testing, not even medical. The Hadwen Trust in Oxford amongst 
others has developed a complete system, exploiting no animals, that could be made 
mandatory. 
Dr Hadwen Trust offers animal-free, human-relevant research. All trials must cease 
and desist as a result of this appeal, on animals and on humans, due to the 
impossibility of 'informed consent'. The infant tecchnology that is being used, has 
been lobbied as accurate and predictable but it is not.  
 
26. Conditions for cows at abattoirs have been exposed but we have not had the 
opportunity to bring court proceedings against the meat industry or individuals. There 
was a rush of 'rape rack' training advertised on Done Deal where people can pay 
and practice artificial insemination skills on a suspended cow before she is 
slaughtered. 
Calves are routinely dragged from their mothers before receiving the crucial 
colostrum for their immune systems, for the dairy industry. This creates another level 
of antibacterial resistance, as calves must receive them, to be kept alive through 
pneumonia.  
 
27. Cows are shown electric-prodded in and then rolled upside down in a form of cat 
scan tunnel, throats cuts and then thrown still alive onto the floor under another, now 
hanging up, also still alive, in front of the next one pinned in the tunnel. 
 
A police officer Lyn White reported: Cruelty to animals affects people adversely, too" 
She recalls that she once attended a domestic when she was with the police. The 
man had abused the woman. But what stood out for her was that this normally mild 
mannered man was now working in an abattoir to provide for his family. He loved 

animals so his hatred for the job grew and grew until it controlled him. Sometimes 
the price of conformity is too high. In fact, perhaps always. 
 
We appeal to the court to stop these industries, devoid of humanity, from continuing, 
let alone assuming absolute control over all people as well as animals. 
 
28. Blood Spatter Experiments by the military 
Massive animal cruelty and abuse exposed throughout the food, science, 
entertainment and every other industry, including the use of pigs for the military to tie 
down and shoot, just to observe blood spatter patterns. 
 
29. COP28 Climate action incongruence. What was not discussed was the monopoly 
on water or the environmental impact of animal agriculture in regard to water; with up 
to 15,000 litres of fresh water to produce 1kg of beef. Farmers use three quarters of 
the world's fresh water.  
 
We refuse to entertain the promotion of Carbon Capture and Storage. 1) It is so 
dangerous to upset the other critical processes such as photosynthesis. 2) All living 
things requite carbon. The COP28 was a warning in plain sight of the plan to restrict 
people's movement and choices, create a captured market for their own products, 
and all under the pretext of a climate crisis, PHEIC - a public health emergency of 
international concern.  
 
Genetically Modified Round-Up Resistant corn or any other toxic food must be 
banned as it kills the pollinators, the other plant life, and is present in human and 
animal cancers.  
 
If all crops, all unsprayed grown on farms transitioning to organic, were directed to 
people directly, there would be no shortage and the remainder would feed the 
recovering animals in a natural system where grazing can be provided year around. 
 
30. We do not consent to the high level deals with America and China to produce 
meat and dairy for them. Minister Simon Coveney has stepped down recently but 
must be held to account for his treasonous negotiation of Ireland's resources with the 
Trans Atlantic Trade Partnership Negotiators. 
 
31. The undervaluing of developing countries' produce has already happened by this 
same TTP - as the US has just decided that meat must not be labelled as to where it 
came from so that shoppers cant be biassed. We do not consent.  
 
There is no differentiation between factory-produced and animal products produced 
from animals that have seen daylight or even free range or ejoyed any adherence to 
animal welfare principles. 
Ireland, for example, is not allowed to say that their cows are from Ireland anymore. 
It is another matter of jurisdiction and value on the life and productivity of lliving 
beings.  
 
All the recent international trade partnerships and treaties will have to be revoked, if 
justice is done and the defendants held to account. 
32. The Right To Resue sick animals has just been lost in the last two weeks. 

Animal Rights Activist Convicted of Felony for Rescuing Sick Chickens 
 Hsiung’s use of a necessity defense was denied, "a person is permitted to trespass 
onto private property to aid ailing animals". 
 
A gag order barring him from speaking with the media about the case. 
 
All the member states have had a "gag order" put on us. No other scientific or 
political enquiry is allowed. Feedom of speech is gone already.  
 
In the case, "the defendants were able to show that the animals had no value, as 
understood by agribusiness; therefore their removal could not be shown to be a loss 
of value to the company."  
 
I ask the honourable court to ensure the appeal is heard because the consequence 
of the the defendant's agenda, enshrined in to law by the upcoming treaty and IHR 
amendments vote will be complete humiliation for all living things: No value, no 
jurisdiction and no protection. 
 
The defendants are trespassing and intend to overreach their authority. Only one 
delegate from each member state will be allowed at the Conference of the Parties 
and every single one of them has been compromised and recruited, with the promise 
of full control over their nation's budget. All the African countries, the Caribbean, 
Indonesia and of course Palestine are set to be ruined and bankrupted, so that their 
abundant natural resources can be mined, at the countries' own expense and risk.  
 
33. The corporations and international organizations will not back down unless they 
are required to do so by the Federal Supreme Court. This has been shown time and 
time again. For example, the Biden administration backed a petition by National Pork 
Producers Council (NPPC) and American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF) filed to 
oppose Prop 12 an animal welfare bill, and sue the state in 2019. They claimed Prop 
12 violates the Commerce Clause of the US Constitution.  https://media.4-

How With The Hate Speech Laws, and AI registering anything ‘adversarial, even 
saying no becomes a crime 
30th April 2024 How Saying No Becomes A Crime 
 Gripping Analysis of the Bill that Simon Harris wants to push through, article by 
article 
 
Having studied the un-loving Speech Bill, it is clear it is a financial business plan for 
Ireland in three ways. If they can criminalize the people en masse, though, they 
guarantee themselves a steady and lucrative income stream.  
 
Fines of 5000, even for a friend of a friend 
1.Quite blatantly, legitimising a Class A fine of €5000, on the pretext they might have 

spoken “recklessly” on line (not even “intentionally”) means that every man, woman 
and child can be landed with a debt, a criminal record and no way to make a living or 
clear their name or pay that alleged debt. Even the slightest resistance to handing 
over their passwords, our only means to access our bank accounts remember, also 
justifies the fine.  
 
How The State Cashes In 
2) What is less well known is that the State makes a vast amount of money from 
every criminal case, in fact the more times a hearing or decision is deferred, the 
better. By threatening Google and co, the platforms themselves will police the 
internet and censor anything that might incur a fine. By empowering the gardai, they 
threaten us physically. 
 
Don’t be under any illusion that some minority group will be better protected by this 
bill. No one will have any actual jurisdiction (lawful power) to bring a case, and there 
will be no ways to avoid or win a case. It is just the process that is such a money-
spinner for the government: The process is to track, bring disgrace and dereliction 
and chip and pin on every family. You may want it to stop but they know it's a deep 
vein of gold to mine.  
 
The Bill would protect the government though, because every difficult question can 
be avoided with this nationwide “gagging order” - Ironically, a gagging order used to 
only be used by intensive farmers in the States to stop people sharing video footage 
of animal abuse to the media or a court. Already my friend was not allowed to show 
footage of police brutality in court. We have to make sure that these wild and 
worsening offences against us are not given a legal footing by entertaining this bill, 
on any level.  
 
AI used by ‘fact checkers’ picks up factually true statements but that register as 
adversarial. Therefore even saying “No thank you” becomes an online harm or 
misinformation. 
 
3) The artificial intelligence used to track down un-loving speech is a) a military 
protocol. AI is specifically programmed b) to deliver targets. Criteria for legitimate 
targets was changed a few years ago, and now merely being part of a c’) signature 
group’ makes you a target. In Israel this has meant that the military was only able to 
identify 50 civilian targets a year, but now with the AI, they boast of 100 targets a 
day, with no human oversight, and success in bombing half of them. With this bill, 
the Irish people (and I know many other governments are pushing bills like this too, 
because those nations are also bankrupt) are to be the targets.  
 
I Promise to Stop this Madness, Given a Chance. Keep saying "No", until the word 
‘no’ itself, even in self defence, becomes a crime. https://lnkd.in/eR2q5g5b 
 
3rd May 2024 Migration and The Hate Speech and Online Harms Bills are all WEF 
business plans to look retrospectively at private messages from when we were 
censored during Covid and criminalise us. The UN plan to keep us ‘regularly’ 
migrating means, show they hope we will have no power or jurisdiction wherever we 
end up. 
 

Safe, Orderly and Regular! Most people you speak to see migration as an absolute 
tragedy, women and children abused on every border, desperate, vulnerable and in 
shock with no food, belongings or future but it turns out that is exactly how the United 
Nation!s wants us. Broke and homeless. And notice how this is the UN in New York, 
not Switzerland. The US feels it should be there permanently. And maybe it should 
as at least that would be show who is in charge. And then there's the slimmest of 
chances that the organization would have less diplomatic immunity if it was moved 
but not much.  
 
Desperate Attempts to Stop The Deployment of Bombs, GMO Mosquitoes, Other 
Technologies and People are already failing, the American way has already crept in 
like a trojan horse, through Nato, police violence and breeding racism, where there 
was none. The other truly American thing we've allowed in are the pharmaceutical 
companies with their mission statement "To have every citizen on at least 4 
prescribed drugs from cradle to grave" 
 
The Caribbean Supplementary Evidence sent to support my Appeal to the Swiss 
Federal Supreme Court proves how well that is working out for them. 
 
We Can't Even Stop Things In Our Own  
Countries, let Alone If We're Forced to Move 
 
“There has been no long-term 
study and risk analysis for humans and the 
environment regarding the spread of mosquitoes, 
this will pose a risk to the safety 
and health of workers. 
There are also still unclear regulations 
and legal means regarding who is responsible 
if the release of mosquitoes exposed to 
Wolbachia bacteria causes unpredictable damage 
to human health and the environment." 
 
"Annex II of the New York Declaration set in motion a process of intergovernmental 
consultations and negotiations towards the development of a Global Compact for 
Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration."  
 
This is the first inter-governmentally negotiated agreement, prepared under the 
auspices of the United Nations, covering all dimensions of international migration in 
a holistic and comprehensive manner" The only way it is holistic and comprehensive 
is as a business plan. The UN goes on to say "It demonstrates commitment to 
"strengthen the contribution of migrants and migration to sustainable development." I 
don't think people know they are contributing to the SDGs as they drag their broken 
limbs from pillar to post but just as long as someone is getting some profit from it, I 
will endeavour to flag this up too at the Appeal. I have asked that the UN be 
dismantled and people be granted compensation and safe passage home. 
 
The biological warfare, surveillance, technology and shift to non-consensual 
imposition means that the military have to leave as do DARPA, WEF and all the dark 
entities.  

 
We need to apologise to nature and we need to compensate the people.  
 
Summary of Community Unacceptable Risks by Professor Richard Claproth: 
• The spread of millions of insects has a major impact on tourism 
• The World Mosquito Program's strategy to continuously GROW Wolbachia bacteria 
in mosquitoes means that Balinese residents and tourists must be prepared to 
receive hundreds of millions of additional mosquito bites. Mosquitoes must get a 
blood meal before they can produce eggs. Each female mosquito will produce 100 
eggs, three times during her adult life. 
 
• Global Petition to Stop Genetic Engineering - Gene Drive 
• Gene drive engineered mosquitoes have not received approval for release into the 
open or for field testing; because it propagates permanent genetic changes in the 
ecosystem. The impact on human health and the environment cannot be predicted 
no matter how good the initial intentions. Read more here 
• After release, the spread of mosquitoes exposed to Wolbachia bacteria cannot be 
controlled or returned to normal. [Gene Drives: Assessing Benefits & Risks - Future 
of Life Institute] 
 
• An international petition has gathered more than 308,000 signatures this year, 
arguing that gene drive research is so dangerous to humans and the environment 
that it must be stopped globally. View the petition here 
• Who is responsible for releasing mosquitoes in Bali 
• Will the World Mosquito Program, researchers, funders, mosquito egg producers 
and universities conducting research be held responsible if errors occur or the 
program has a negative impact. 
• Diseases and the damage they cause are almost impossible to trace. 
• Before releasing the mosquitoes, we require the Ministries of Defense, Tourism, 
Forestry, BAIS, BIN, the Governor of Bali, the Mayor of Denpasar, the Environmental 
Service in Bali and other relevant component authorities to DECLARE the extent of 
their obligations and authority in vetoing the release of the mosquitoes. 
 
• There are no consequences and responsibilities due to the impact of biotechnology 
• Will releasing mosquitoes produce more dangerous variants of the Zika virus? See 
article in The Ecologist 
• Does the Dengue Fever vaccine in the Philippines cause a deadly variant of the 
measles virus? Read it on NPR 
• Wolbachia bacteria have a symbiotic relationship with parasites which actually 
worsen tropical diseases; even though releasing mosquitoes was originally aimed at 
reducing tropical diseases. Look in PubMed 
• Wolbachia can cause elephantiasis (elephantiasis) and river blindness. Source: 
scielo.br & pubmed 
 
• Escalation of Dengue Fever Threat in Sri Lanka Following Mosquito Release 
• In Sri Lanka there has been an increase in mosquito larvae so that cases of 
Dengue Fever have doubled since the mass release of mosquitoes in 2021. Crisis24 
- Dengue Fever Activity Increases in Sri Lanka 
 
• Comprehensive Due Diligence Protocol (Comprehensive Investigation Protocol) 

• Due Diligence Mosquito Release 
• We strongly request a “Comprehensive Investigation Protocol” that includes an 
evaluation of resilience and national security, public health and the environment, 
legal, operational techniques of the Wolbachia mosquito release program, funding, 
transparency, effectiveness assessment and a thorough long-term risk analysis 
before mosquito releases are carried out . 
• The Denpasar Regional Government in Bali must announce the following: 
• Risk of spread to other species, disproportionate and sustained increase in 
mosquito populations, assessment of the risk of vertical gene transmission in 
imported mosquito eggs, safety of utilization of Wolbachia bacteria and application of 
Matrix‑Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization‑Time Of Flight (MALDI‑TOF) & 
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) uses Wolbachia mosquitoes. Look here 
• Precautions regarding the Use of MALDI‑TOF MS & CNN in Mosquito Releases on 
National Security & Resilience 
• Non-disclosure (must not be disclosed). Not disclosing the use of Matrix‑Assisted 
Laser Desorption Ionization‑Time Of Flight (MALDI‑TOF) & Convolutional Neural 
Network (CNN) in the release of mosquitoes in Bali which could threaten National 
Security and Resilience. Look here 
 
• Wolbachia bacteria (Natural) and Internet Protocol Technology (IPT) via 
Wolbachia: 
• AU Expansion Model.pdf DOWNLOAD_DISI 
• The World Mosquito Program (WMP) claims that the Wolbachia bacteria and 
mosquitoes used in this research are natural and not genetically modified. Look here 
• However, inserting Internet Protocol Technology (IPT); uses automated 
microinjection to insert bacteria; and creating Gene Drives all require genetic 
engineering. 
• Artificial Intelligence in Mosquitoes: Artificial Intelligence simulations are used to 
analyze risks and biohazards (Microsoft's Artificial Intelligence). 
• Release of Responsibility: Anyone responsible for monitoring, supervising, 
collecting data, mapping locations, and scheduling the distribution of mosquito eggs 
is protected from liability by the existence of patents and legal exemptions, and 
Microsoft is willing to pay legal fees in the event of copyright infringement. Link: 
Protection_from_Claims). 
• Wolbachia IP (Internet Protocol) technology in gene drives in Bali is a major threat 
to National Security and Resilience as well as Public Health and Safety and the 
environment. The owner of the Wolbachia IP Technology patent (Wolbachia IP 
Patent Link) has claimed exclusive rights to all digital equipment, data collected and 
transmitted using this technology. This indicates a conflict of interest for the World 
Mosquito Program. There is a threat that the injection of artificial intelligence 
technology through mosquito bites can transmit information to the human body with 
unknown purposes. 
• Bali as a location for biotechnology experiments

transmitting energy and data," Unified Patents. Bill Gates Patent: US-6754472-B1. 
Patent Link US-6754472-B1 
 
• Disease Transmission in Mosquito Eggs 
• This document well notes that mosquito eggs carry the Dengue Fever virus and 

other diseases. Knowledge about Gene Transfer, from generation to generation, 
should be the basis for refusing the mass release of mosquito eggs. 
• Zika discovery: link:ubmed-zika 
• Dengue Fever: link:cademic.oup.com 
• Chikungunya: link:parasitesandvectors.biomedcentral.com 
• Malaria: link:nhm.ac.uk 
 
• Planned hundreds of millions of eggs to be distributed in Bali, imported with 
additional undetected pathogenic diseases. 
• The goal of WMP is not to reduce mosquito populations, but rather to spread them.

• A species of mosquito that can no longer be controlled through fogging is being 
released in Bali. link: ncbi.nlm.nih.gov 
• Mosquitoes are insects but have now been recorded as pesticides. link:epa.gov "As 
with all pesticides, mosquitoes have been modified 
 
(9) genetics are regulated under the Federal Pesticides Insecticide, Fungicide and 
Rodenticide Act (FIFRA)." Even if we accept that they are not the product of genetic

OPEN SCIENCE MANIFESTO - by Professor Richard Claproth 
  
1. Principle 1: Enable an Inclusive Container of Knowledge 
• The Open Science Team must create a knowledge platform where each individual 
has the rights and means to determine how his or her knowledge is organized and 
managed to meet his or her needs. 
  
2. Principle 2: Recognize Cognitive Justice 
• Open Science teams must recognize cognitive justice, namely the need for diverse 
understandings of how knowledge is created in order to co-exist in scientific 
production. 
  
3. Principle 3: Practice Situational Openness 
• This principle emphasizes that Open Science must pay attention to the ways in 
which context, power, and inequality influence scientific research. This means that 

disclosure of information must be adapted to specific situations. 
  
4. Principle 4: Support Every Individual's Right to Research 
• This principle advocates the right of every individual to conduct research and 
allows various forms of participation at all stages of the research process. 
  
5. Principle 5: Encourage Fair Collaboration 
• Open science should encourage fair cooperation between scientists and social 
actors. This involves establishing equal partnerships and fostering co-creation and 
social innovation in society. 
  
6. Principle 6: Inclusive of Infrastructure 
• Emphasize the importance of inclusive infrastructure, enabling everyone, including 
those with varying abilities, to use and contribute to accessible open source 
technologies. 
  
7. Principle 7: Using Knowledge as a Path to Sustainable Development 
• This last principle states that open and collaborative science should seek to use 
knowledge as a tool to achieve sustainable development. Every individual must be 
empowered to improve the well-being of society and the planet. 
  
The seven things above are the basic principles proposed to achieve more inclusive 
and collaborative open science in the development context. 
 
Mass releases contravene International Human Rights Treaty against torture 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Convention_Against_Torture releasing 
hundreds of millions of biting female mosquitoes.  
 
Please stop these terrifying plans.

Dear Ways and Means Committee, 
I am writing to express my strong support for HB300 HD1, which includes funding for the 
Waimānalo Research Station and Magoon Research and Teaching Station. I am Theodore 
Radovich, a faculty member with statewide Extension responsibilities at the University of 
Hawaii’s College of Tropical Agriculture and Resilience. While my work extends across the 
state, a significant portion of my teaching and research activities are conducted at 
the Waimānalo Research Station and Magoon Research and Teaching Station. 
The Waimānalo Research Station, established in 1955, has been instrumental in promoting 
diversified agriculture in Hawaii for over 60 years. This facility has consistently worked  to 
disseminate science-based information and solve problems facing producers. The station’s 
research activities include: 
• Breeding and selecting food crops for sustainable local production 
• Apiculture (Bee Program) 
• Certified organic agriculture 
• Aquaponics 
• Beginner farmer training 
The Waimānalo Research Station also hosts The Waimānalo Learning Center (WLC). Initiated in 
2012, the WLC has welcomed thousands of community members annually, improving 
awareness of the station’s research activities and supporting ’aina-based education for keiki 
and their ’ohana. 
Similarly, the Magoon Research and Teaching Station plays a crucial role in our agricultural 
research and education efforts. These facilities are essential for: 
• Conducting cutting-edge research to address Hawaii’s unique agricultural challenges 
• Training the next generation of agricultural professionals 
• Engaging with the community to promote sustainable farming practices 
• Supporting local farmers and producers with evidence-based solutions 
As a Professor and Extension specialist, I can attest to the importance of these stations in 
fulfilling our mission to provide information, education, and encourage the application of 
research-based knowledge. The work conducted at these facilities directly contributes to the 
development of sustainable agricultural practices, food security, and economic growth in 
Hawaii. 
HB300 HD1 provides much needed support for the Waimanalo Research Station and Magoon 
Research and Teaching Station. This investment will yield significant returns in terms of 
agricultural innovation, education, and community engagement for years to come. 
Thank you for your consideration. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Theodore Radovich, Ph.D.

Dear Chair and Members of the Senate Ways and Means Committee, 
Aloha, 
I am writing to express my strong support for the inclusion of $5.5 million for the Waimānalo 
CARES Center and $6 million for the Magoon Research and Teaching Station in the state 
budget bill, HB 300, HD1. These allocations are crucial for our community and will have a 
significant positive impact on both the residents of Waimānalo and the broader educational and 
research efforts in Hawaii. 
Waimānalo CARES Center: 
The Waimānalo CARES Center plays a vital role in providing essential services and support to 
the local community. This funding will enable the center to enhance its programs, expand its 
reach, and improve the quality of life for residents. By investing in this center, we are investing 
in the well-being and prosperity of our community. 
Magoon Research and Teaching Station: 
The Magoon Research and Teaching Station is an important educational and research facility 
that contributes significantly to Hawaii's academic and environmental initiatives. This funding 
will support critical research projects, educational programs, and community engagement 
activities, ultimately benefiting both students and the broader community. 

I urge you to approve these allocations as they represent a wise investment in our state's future. 
These projects align with the values of community support, education, and environmental 
stewardship that are essential to Hawaii's growth and prosperity. 
Thank you for considering my testimony. I look forward to your support for these important 
initiatives. 
Mahalo, 
Puuoneomakapuu Johnson

To: Senator Donovan M. Dela Cruz, Chair 
      Sharon Y. Moriwaki, Vice Chair 
      Members of the Senate Committee on Ways and Means 
From: Christina Simmons, Kaneohe Resident 
Subject: HB No. 300, HD1 - Testimony in Support of EOEL Budget Request 
Dear Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki, and members of the committee, 
I am writing with two requests: 1) to support funding to expand early learning opportunities for 
Hawaiʻi’s keiki and 2) to include the addition of Family Child Interactive Learning (FCIL) 
programs to the budget. 
These worthwhile investments will improve access to high-quality early childhood education for 
underserved populations, allowing more parents to work while their keiki are in safe and fruitful 
environments, and help advance progress toward universal access to early learning for three and 
four-year-olds. 
In particular, I support retaining funding in the House Draft of the Budget which provides 
funds and positions to open 50 additional Executive Office on Early Learning (EOEL) 
Public Prekindergarten classrooms over the next two years (EDN700). These funds will: 
● Improve educational equity through priority enrollment for at-risk children; 
● Support progress toward universal access to early learning for three and four- 
year-olds; and 
● Promote Kindergarten readiness. 
I also respectfully request this committee consider adding funding for Family Child 
Interaction Learning (FCIL) Program contracts to the budget for EOEL (EDN700). FCILs 
are an important component of our early learning system for the following reasons: 
● Expand the variety of early learning opportunities for families 
● Utilize a multi-generational, culturally responsive approach 
● Support family efforts to take an active role in the social, emotional, and cognitive 
development of their children 
● Dual focus on parent education and early learning 
The expansion of these programs will help more keiki access high-quality early learning 
experiences that set the foundation for lifelong success. 

For these reasons, I respectfully urge you to include this funding in the Senate Draft of the 
budget. 
Sincerely, 
Christina Simmons MPH, IBCLC (emeritus)

Aloha Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki, and Committee Members: 
My name is Lisa Darcy from Kula, Maui, HI. I have worked in the human services field for 
almost 40 years and am strongly opposed to bill HB300. I oppose provisions in HB300 that 
expand mass incarceration and the building of a new $1 billion jail. 
The work I asssiting those released from incarceration without any supports, any supports, is 
grossly underfunded. As a result, cycles of incarceration keep people dependent and trapped in 
the incarceration system. My work can pop maybe 1:100 people I work with out and the rest 
simply continue to spin in circles without any assistance. This legislation is misdirected and does 
not address root causes. 
The proposed budget includes an appropriation for the building of a "new" OCCC. We don’t 
need a new, $1 billion jail. Instead, we need to fund youth and education programs, affordable 
housing, job training, family strengthening and violence interruption programs, community-
based health, treatment and reintegration programs rooted in evidence-based practices, and 
restorative justice to help us build communities that are safe, healthy, and equitable. 
Much of my work is done without funding and as a reult does not show up on any radar. You 
have the ability to reverse this harmful process and vote no on this bill. This system is inverted. I 
want my voice to be clearly heard and to know that almost 40yrs of work on the streets is cost 
effective and grows stronger community. 
In the absence of a public health-based approach to public safety, we cannot invest in prisons, 
rather we need to invest in our communities—diversion programs, mental health care treatment, 
and permanent supportive housing. All of my life experience is behind this testimony. Please 
oppose HB300. At anytime, I am available for clarification. 
Lisa Darcy, Kula HI

Re:  HB300,  State budget   
Aloha Chair Dela Cruz, V-Chair Moriwaki and Members of the Senate WAM Committee: 
My name is Gail Breakey, and I live in Waipio Gentry. I am testifying in opposition to provisions 
in HB 300 that includes planning for a new prison.  I was involved in planning for alternatives to 
incarceration 40 years ago, plans that have never been implemented… always in favor of new 
prison facilities.  We need to support families and develop alternatives to incarceration as has 
been the case in European countries, which have far less crime than the US.  
The current budget bill would appropriate $30 MILLION for planning relating to the proposed 
new jail to replace OCCC, $10 MILLION for a 10-year Department of Corrections Statewide 
Master Plan, and MILLIONS more for jail and prison expansion and maintenance. What’s more, 
the State is pushing for a Public-Private-Partnership (P3) to finance, design, construct, and 
maintain the new jail. This will make taxpayers $1 billion poorer, not safer!  
 
Programs rooted in evidence-based practices, and restorative justice to help us build 
communities that are safe, healthy, and equitable. Safety for all includes housing, living wages, 
and mental health treatment. Hawaiʻi is not safer with billion-dollar jail expansion projects 
prioritized over access to healthy foods, healthcare, decent jobs, and safe and stable housing.   
  
Please fund $3 million in family planning to ensure low-income and underinsured patients can 
continue accessing reproductive healthcare. Please do NOT fund $30 million for planning the 
proposed new jail to replace OCCC, $10 million for a 10-year Department of Corrections 
Statewide Master Plan.  We should be funding healthcare, public education, healthy food, and 
affordable housing, not a new prison. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Gail Breakey, RN, MPH

Please consider supporting HB300. While a much-needed increase in Med-QUEST 
reimbursement rates for Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) providers was approved for CY 2025 
following legislative requests like House Resolution 207, this funding is currently non-
reoccurring. Making these adequate rates permanent is essential to ensure continued access to 
necessary ABA services for all eligible Med-QUEST beneficiaries who can benefit from this 
evidence-based approach to behavior change. Supporting HB300 is a critical step in advocating 
for the sustained financial stability of ABA providers, enabling them to serve a diverse range of 
needs within the community, including but cetainly not limited to, the severly underserved 
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) community of clients and their families. Mahalo.

HB300 funds dangerous mosquito release experiments on Maui and Kaua‘i. The supposed 
reason is to protect song birds. But this is false. There is no evidence that introducing cyborg 
maoquitos into the environment will save these birds.  
Whenever Man interferes with nature with a man-made substance or species, it ALWAYS goes 
awry.  
Please do NOT fund this.

“I’m opposed to Executive Budget funding through HB300 for Wolbachia-
bacteria-infected mosquito releases on Maui and Kaua‘i.” 
There are so many reasons this is a bad idea.  Any past attempt to "change mother 
nature and introduce exotics to the islands have been a disaster!!" 
• 
Accidental release of female mosquitoes that bite, breed, and spread 
disease (EPA guidelines allow for the release of one female for every 
250,000 males; just one female released can produce 160,000 more 
females through breeding of the generations in her lifespan; 3,103 females 
are allowed to be released weekly on Maui – up to 6,000 mosquitoes 
released twice weekly per acre in the 64,666-acre project area: 6,000 x 2 x 
64,666 = 775,992,000 mosquitoes divided by 250,000 equals 3,103 
females weekly) 
• 
Peer-reviewed studies showing Wolbachia bacteria can cause increased 
pathogen infection and disease-spreading capability in mosquitoes 
• 
Horizontal transmission of Wolbachia bacteria to wild mosquitoes and 
other insect vectors of disease 
• 
Population replacement of wild mosquitoes with lab-altered mosquitoes 
(as few as three females released can cause population replacement) 
• 
Wind drift of released mosquitoes to unintended areas 
• 
Lack of documented biosecurity protocols and pathogen screenings for the 
imported mosquitoes 
• 
Risks to the health of people and animals, and the potential for the plan to 
cause the extinction of the native birds it is meant to protect. 
• 
We do not need bioweapons laboratories in Hawaii and  crazy biological 
experiments with our fragile environment. 
• 
Please vote no.

I oppose the release of any mosquitos in the State of Hawaii for any purpose whatsoever. Please 
vote with your conscience, your gut and your common sense as your guide. Remember that you 
have to sleep at night like everyone else in the Islands. Dropping mosquitos on the heads of your 
constituents in unconscionable.  There is no legitimate reason, either for scientific or for public 
health for releasing mosquitos into the State of Hawaii. If you are being persuaded otherwise, 
please take pause and understand that you will be responsible for releasing Pandora's box on the 
heads of your constituents, yourself and your family. I suffered from mosquitos on the Mainland 
for many years and it is a disaster. It does not matter that you are being told the mosquitos are 
infertile. The idea is simply scientific and health hackery. Please make the right decision for your 
self and all of us Hawaiians and vote against this measure.

Summer Sylva, Waimanalo, HI 96795 
Dear Chair and Members of the Senate Ways and Means Committee, 
Aloha, 
I am writing to express my strong support for the inclusion of $5.5 million for the Waimānalo 
CARES Center and $6 million for the Magoon Research and Teaching Station in the state 
budget bill, HB 300, HD1. These allocations are crucial for our community; support our 
proactive initiatives, proposals, and engagements with our community partners; and will have a 
significant positive impact on both the residents of Waimānalo and the broader educational and 
research efforts in Hawaiʻi. 
Waimānalo CARES Center: 
The Waimānalo CARES Center plays a vital role in providing essential services and support to 
the local community. This funding will enable the center to enhance its programs, expand its 
reach, and improve the quality of life for residents. By investing in this center, we are investing 
in the well-being and prosperity of our community. 
Magoon Research and Teaching Station: 
The Magoon Research and Teaching Station is an important educational and research facility 
that contributes significantly to Hawaii's academic and environmental initiatives. This funding 
will support critical research projects, educational programs, and community engagement 
activities, ultimately benefiting both students and the broader community. 
I urge you to approve these allocations as they represent a wise investment in our state's future. 
These projects align with the values of community support, education, and environmental 
stewardship that are essential to Hawaii's growth and prosperity. 
Thank you for considering my testimony. I look forward to your support for these important 
initiatives. 
Mahalo ~ Summer Sylva

Comments:  
I strongly object to funding the mosquito project that’s been sold to Hawaiian leaders and urge 
our leaders and all Hawaiians to oppose this and any future mosquito project that requires 
introducing manufactured mosquitoes into a single Hawaiian ecosystem anywhere, whether for 
“emergency,” “experimental,” or any other alleged justification.   
  
For the following reasons, I stand against this project: 
  
Every single fact referenced and filed as lawsuits by Hawaii Unites and Mike Yellen! 
  
Project Success Criteria Analysis. I compared other projects proposed to other municipalities to 
verify that this type of project succeeds. I was unable to find a single proof-of-concept success. I 
then evaluated other project requirements to determine if the proposed project meets and exceeds 
enough factors to guarantee success here. What I found was that this project deviates from past 
tested failed projects in several ways, some of which predict project failure and even point to 
project design for failure: 
  
Other municipalities required that zero females be allowed per release, as a metric for success to 
avoid invasive species population replacement. This project allows 3000 per week on Maui, 
which is more than necessary to guarantee population replacement, thus ensuring failure of stated 
goals, and since the project claims to have studied other projects, this metric points to design for 
failure. 
  
Other municipalities required release population count ratio per acre many hundreds of times 
more dense than the proposed project on Maui (in flat low wind areas), but at that ratio, those 

projects failed. Maui’s terrain is far more vast, complex, windy, vertically diverse, and as such 
would require exponentially more population density to have a remote chance of success. Per 
this measure, this project is scaled too low for Hawaii’s geography, thus guaranteeing failure of 
stated goals and indicating design for failure. 
  
Exporting experimental mosquitoes from California where Bird Flu is rampant in the air exposes 
the project’s experimental invasive mosquitoes to Bird Flu, a virus requiring quarantine and 
culling. After exposure from California, Hawaii’s endangered bird’s reproductive nesting areas 
will receive potentially Bird Flu exposed invasive mosquitoes directly over their head in large 
numbers. This point alone indicates such a severe lack of understanding of living systems that 
proves the project is designed to fail, whether due to intention, ignorance, or lack of informed 
safe and effective procedures. 
  
This project claims to have sufficient knowledge of Hawaii’s culture, ecosystems, and endemic 
species such that the project rules out any possibility of horizontal transfer to any significant 
species, ecosystem, or culturally important criteria. Published Wolbachia research found 
horizontal transfer to soil species, thus risking altering soil systems in unpredictable and 
potentially harmful, even catastrophic ways; rapid and highly morphological impacts to 
unexpected species; and, culturally vital to Hawaiians, Wolbachia has been found to transfer to 
crustaceans of similar type to the Opa’é freshwater shrimp. Soil and water being the lowest 
points under the drop zones, even low drop counts have high potential for horizontal Wolbachia 
transfer to soils and Opa’é. That this does not appear in the project playbook as declared 
indicates lack of disclosure, lack of due diligence, or design for failure.  
  
The project claims to have sufficient knowledge of Wolbachia horizontal transfer to rule out all 
possible negative effects upon people and livestock. Although Wolbachia doesn't directly infect 
people, nor mammals, in published studies it has been found to inhabit parasites that do infect 
animals and people, such as filarial nematodes, and many parasites remain to be 
studied.  Wolbachia produces chemicals to reward it’s hosts, possibly for steering to favored 
spots in host anatomy.  Wolbachia are extremely fond of testes and ovaries, and once inside 
human parasites, may accidentally or  potentially migrate to reproductive organs as it does in 
other species. The project did not disclose that Wolbachia are proven to transfer to parasitic 
species. Perhaps because this is such a vast area with many questions that should have been 
acknowledged and answered. Certainly more studies are needed, but If the project gets this 
wrong, the project will have achieved a transmissible parasite borne STD that may partially or 
totally sterilize people. Maui visitors will carry it home, Maui’s reputation will suffer. The 
question then arises, when in Hawaii it’s finally proven, which it will be, that Wb transferred to 
human parasites which have an affinity for ovaries and testes, and as a result people have 
become sterilized, how will you compensate for loss of children?  

  
As for the project’s sudden introduction of Bti bacterial fungicide, you can build trust by 
submitting full transparency now, otherwise project secrecy needs to be subpoena’d. Because by 
introducing ‘emergency’ Bti spraying, the likely rationale and pattern is that the project has 
unleashed failure factors at best, or a monster at worst, they know it, and they’re trying to cover 
it up before Hawaiian leadership, and all Hawaiians, and the world know about it.  The project 
claims to have introduced Bti Bacterial Fungicide to enhance proofs of the project’s success. In 
any new experimental test, according to test engineering professional standards, each factor must 
be tested fully, independently, before combination tests. Wolbachia is the first variable to pass 
engineering test evaluation, the invasive mosquito species is the second variable, because they 
are inseparable once in the field, they count as one field test with two test metric rollups. 
Preserving cohesive boundaries for field testing is essential. By introducing chemical drops of 
Bti Bacterial Fungicide, the projects claim that this makes their ecosystem engineering look 
better is entirely the opposite. Introducing the vast dynamics of Bti Fungicide drops into 
Hawaii’s ecosystems, which is a deviation from the plan’s playbook, strongly indicates project 
engineering failure sufficient to require a failover rescue of some sort. Introducing a failover so 
early in the project telegraphs that some failure known to the project was detected, but was 
unknown to the sponsors, for which some correction, coverup, or remediation became required to 
get the project back on track without attracting attention. Had I approved budget according to the 
original plan, then been told to fund Bti Fungicide, I would have winked at this proof of project 
failure, and immediately halted all further funding.  
  
Last October my daughter and I hiked remote mountain trails in east Maui and I got 3 mosquito 
bites. One mosquito bite was entirely normal, but the other two bites were a horrific experience 
I’ve never had before. One bite swelled up to a 2 inch pus filled lump that oozed pus like a spigot 
for a week. The third bite swelled to a 3 inch lump that also leaked runny pus for a week. How 
does your project provide transparency linked to medical services so that I can investigate and 
verify each of my 3 mosquito bites? Once I was bit, I spoke with others with the same 
experience, what are you doing to protect us in terms of a data trail linking your project and 
medical services? The project appears to have failed any such protective measures, thus 
indicating design for failing critical safeguards. (pictures available upon request) 
  
Please list each piece of legislation that allegedly allows exposing the human species, that is 
living men and women, to experimental invasive bacteria inside an invasive species of 
mosquitoes under the excuse of ‘emergency authorization’ for an avian species when the laws 
regarding emergency use clearly pertain to the human species? And if no one there can list that 
legislation, can you please have someone research and publish the full legislative sequence? 
Because so far your project demonstrates one over-riding mentality: assumptions that you 
already have voter approved powers to spray anyone, anywhere, at any time, with any substance 
that you so wish. Well your personal liability and worldwide laws stand firm witness against 
you. No one has an “emergency right” nor an “experimental right” to injure another at all, not by 

contamination, not by low level biowar, not with any invasive exposure of potential injury to any 
living man, woman, or child. I and Aina are not for sale under “emergencies” nor for 
experiments. As for birds, what damage control could matter more than protecting them where 
they are from any further invasive species.  
  
I’ve had anaphylaxis 4 times, I moved to Hawaii to avoid as many insects and chemicals as 
possible that could cause another anaphylactic reaction. So I have questions: How thoroughly 
will you notify every single person whenever you are going to expose people to Bti larval 
fungicide, or to invasive mosquitoes, and to all chemicals/contaminations in project deliverables 
that may harm people like me? 
  
As far as solutions, we would like to require the following level of open transparency so as to 
guarantee that none of the problems that developed with Aedes mosquitoes in project P-268 ever 
happen in Hawaii. So before listing the solution, I would like to summarize the P-268 project, 
one that Colorado State University was involved in. Quoting from the project,  "the use of Aedes 
mosquitoes as biological weapons, exactly the same ones operated by the U.S. military 
department, is recorded in the class action suit of Cuban citizens against the U.S. government 
and was submitted to the member States of the Biological Weapons Convention. The class action 
notes that the 1981 dengue epidemic in Cuba that contaminated 345 thousand people and 
resulted in the death of 158 persons was the result of the spread of the second dengue virus 
serotype that had not previously been recorded in the Caribbean and had clear signs of a 
deliberate nature. Thus, the time of the attack (late January) was chosen in consideration of 
biological features of the life cycle of mosquito vectors and was optimal for the subsequent 
development of the epidemic process. In addition, the only place on the island where no cases 
have been reported was the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo due to pre- vaccination of soldiers 
against the dengue virus type 2." 
So for solutions, transparency then must include full state-of-the-art analysis of the following:  
— toxicological tests on each batch of feedstock for WB, mosquitoes, and all growth/medicinal 
inputs at each stage of incubation through to final placement - fully auditable 
— reporting of all treatments such as growth or sanitization lights, sterilization materials, 
antibiotic treatments, hormone treatments, mold identification and remediation, production, 
transport, and packaging substances  
— all accidents, cross-contamination, anomalies in female placements, 
— long-term tracking of all ER adverse episodes, long-term teratogenic population data, 
— long term monitoring of key points in the environment for Bti fungicide harms like those 
found in earlier research of how Bti fungicide is poisoning the environment. See "Study of the 
environmental impact of insecticides by metabolomic foot-printing approach" 
— all reports regarding Hawaii’s Biosystematics, Informatics and Genetics as gathered from 
Hawaii or introduced to Hawaii 

— All project, project partner, and spinoff funding must declare and make transparent all genetic 
related studies and revenue. According to documents produced by the mosquitoes industry, 
funding surveillance of mosquitoes, their bacteria, and the environment includes, as a major goal, 
plumbing the riches of the various protein species internal to mosquitoes in order to “establish a 
pipeline for generating genetic mutants (protein mutants).” Therefore all genetic mutants 
gathered from the project including all the various protein species internal to mosquitoes and to 
WB - the entire PHIST family that develops in Hawaii be open and transparent to all Hawaiians, 
and it should include accurate phenotypic analysis for any and all proteins or lipoproteins that 
may be introduced to a body as alien and potentially. harmful and or teratogenic, mutagenic, etc. 
— Transparency must also include all antidotes for any adverse effects to any living species due 
to WB or aedes project contamination and injury. 
— All imitator antigens, immune priming, and immune intolerance that are found to develop 
from WB or aedes found within any livestock, wildlife species, or people. 
— Monitoring and reporting of chronic illness among livestock and people.  
  
Every species of mosquito are simply akin to an empty gun’s bullet chamber that can be loaded 
with any desired caliber of bullet. In the case of mosquitoes, their system, their proboscis, can 
transfer varying kinds of pathogens. Hawaii presently has 5 species of mosquitoes with a known 
and limited pathogen list. You’re bringing in a new species of mosquitoes, which historically 
would certainly be considered an invasive species, and one which is already known to be capable 
of carrying MORE pathogens that what we have in Hawaii. In addition, Hawaii’s environment is 
a tropical incubation chamber for pathogens throughout our ecosystems. And we have streams, 
offal piles, septic areas and ditches, and agricultural resources, any of which may incubate and 
harbor pathogens that prior to now have never had a vector bridge into humans. But you’re 
bringing in an empty gun chamber in the way of the females that could uptake novel pathogens 
from Hawaii’s tropical incubator and, because this species is capable of carrying many 
pathogens, may act to bridge pathogens from Hawaii’s environment to our people. What will you 
be doing in the field to identify and remediate such injuries? What will you do when your 
invasive species of mosquitoes and bacteria take some new bacteria from the environment and 
introduce it to far more species of birds?  
  
How much are you putting in a trust fund to protect Hawaii’s tourism and Hawaii’s agriculture 
once word gets out that novel bacteria inside novel mosquitoes made their way into populated 
areas, because they will with 3000 fertile females allowed per week. What will our new tourism 
promote: “Come see Maui, world's largest experimental bacteria laden mosquito farm! Free bites 
and pestilence for all, all inclusive thrills! Take home a memory!”  
  
How much are you putting in a trust for Mollusks and crustaceans, such as the sacred 
ʻ’Ōpaeʻ’ula shrimp, can host Wolbachia, once they are contaminated? These crustaceans will for 

sure eat infected sterilizing novel mosquitoes and likely their larvae in streams and ponds thus 
setting them on a sterilization-injection-by-lab- experiment-gone-wrong crash course.  
  
Legislature should insist upon full factory process transparency so we can verify that the factory 
process that separates females from males has never screwed up, never reversed sorting, never 
accidentally filling helicopters full of dangerous fertile females let loose in the wilds of Maui and 
Kauai instead of sterilizing males. (This would seed invasive novel mosquito species (which 
carry more pathogens) into the islands and might even replace the less pathogenic mosquitoes 
already here.)  
  
How much will you put in a trust for mold or fungal contamination that would harm Hawaii’s 
crops with dangerous mycotoxins. Plants, molds, and soils, especially in a complex tropical 
climate with 10,000 endemic species, can interact with lab grown insects in unpredictable ways. 
Hawaii's many microclimates make for runaway incubators, especially in our commercial 
agriculture. The project should produce full transparency of male genetics and surface microbes. 
Males with a novel infection, mold, or bacterial contamination would pose a huge problem and 
must be fully traceable and transparent.  
  
What safeguards and remediation processes are in place in case lab mosquitos or WB are found 
to depopulate other insects that are a food source for many birds such as moths. Endangered 
birds don’t replenish their populations very well when they are starving.  
  
How will the project remediate damage control for WB spread to Hawaii’s tiny creatures such as 
lice and bird mites, which are certain to acquire the novel sterilizing Wolbachia and who knows 
where the experiment will go once it’s loose in the mite and lice populations. Most wild chickens 
for example, carry mites, as do mynah birds, which are everywhere and will bring the 
“emergency” experiment into our neighborhoods. We need to be able to track and remediate Wb 
in all HI impacted arthropods including tiny creatures and soils.  
  
Project research traceability & audit: Please provide all prior industry research (your own 
proprietary research is optional, but is desired and can be redacted) in your archives and 
correspondence surrounding and supporting your research and production goals regarding 
wolbachia, Bti bacterial larvicide, mosquitoes, all genetic research, protein species internal to 
mosquitoes and WB, sterilization research, generational research, terminator research, and field 
application planning and project management calculations, safeguards and remediation 
measures.  

  
Throughout my entire career as a systems test engineer, one of the professional sub-tasks I 
frequently performed was evaluative analysis of the body of systems analysis supporting a 
project, it’s playbook, plans, and project success criteria supports. That left a deep sense filter 
toward any project I encounter. This project is designed to fail, to be terminated, or to be 
parlayed, harvested, acquired or transmuted. It cannot succeed as stated, and top level mosquito-
as-an-industry promoters know it. One thing is clear: the declared goals, methods, data 
collection, and knowledge base of this project are not what’s advertised. If it were, for one, 
project supports of success determinants that are missing would be there, and they’d be 
extensive.

Senator Donavan Dela Cruz, Chair 
Senator Sharon Moriwaki, Vice Chair 
Members of the Senate Committee on Ways and Means 
RE: 
HB 300, HD 1 - RELATING TO THE STATE BUDGET 
 
Hearing Date – March 18, 2025 at 10 a.m. 
 
Aloha Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki and Members of the Committee, 
Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to submit testimony in support our budget appropriation 
requests set forth in HB 300, HD 1 for the 2026 and 2027 fiscal years. Act 103, SLH 2015, codified as 
HRS Chapter 323F, Part IV ("Act 103") provides for operating and capital subsidies for Maui Health 
System ("MHS") in connection with its operation of the hospitals. Under HRS §323F-58 and the terms 
of the Transfer Agreement signed January 14, 2016 between MHS and Hawai'i Health Systems 
Corporation, the State of Hawai'i, and the Maui Region of Hawai'i Health Systems Corporation (the 
"Transfer Agreement"), MHS may request operating support payments annually based upon the 
amounts needed to cover any operating losses of the Hospitals plus a 2% margin, but the amount 
requested in any year may not exceed the amount appropriated to subsidize the operating costs of the 
Maui Regional System for the 2014 fiscal year, which was $38 million. Under HRS §323F-59 MHS may 
also request support payments for its capital expenditures during the first ten (10) years of MHS' 
operations of the hospitals in an amount not less than $6 million. 
As you may be aware, I officially joined MHS as the Chief Executive Officer on January 1, 2024. I 
have worked closely with our team over the last 14 months to understand the terms of the Transfer 
Agreement and the current financial position of Maui Health. I am honored to be here and serving the 
Maui and Lana’i communities. 
We are grateful for the support provided by the Governor and the State Legislature in sustaining the 
health care system on Maui and Lana'i. Since our public/private partnership began, we have reduced 
our total state funding by over $125 million. 
Unforeseen challenges, including the global pandemic, the devastating wildfires on Maui and two 
labor strikes, have impacted the speed of our progress. While our pace has been slow, the goal 
remains to provide high quality, reliable and accessible health care on Maui and Lana’i without 
taxpayer support. 
Each year we care for over 50,000 patients in our emergency departments across central Maui, 
upcountry Kula, and Lana'i. In addition, Maui Health is the sole provider of inpatient psychiatric care 
on the island and absorbs the cost of those services. Despite progress, we face ongoing economic 
challenges and seek your continued support as we continue to move towards economic self-reliance 
and sustainability.

(2024681.1)LF.docx 
Our commitment extends to caring for over 100 kupuna in long-term care and skilled nursing in Kula 
and Lana'i, managing both hospitals at near full capacity. Our team continues to work with our 
community partners to reduce the number of kupuna waiting for access to long-term care or skilled 
nursing beds but continue to have over 25 patients living in the hospital, utilizing an acute care bed 
when they need long term care. On Maui, adequate long term care beds are available but remain 
empty, reportedly because there are not staff available to provide care. We absorb approximately $4 
million in costs while awaiting long-term care availability. 
Extended lengths of stay for individuals without a safe discharge plan increase the cost of care in 
Maui by $7 million per year. These patients include those who are houseless, have co-occurring 
substance use disorders, under treated mental illness, those needing an inpatient hospice bed, short 
term rehabilitation or those who simply need access to life saving antibiotic infusions that are 
unavailable in remote eastern Maui. 
Looking ahead to State Fiscal Year 2026, hospital reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid and 
Commercial Insurance companies is increasing by less than 3% while the cost of labor, medical 
supplies and drugs are forecasted to continue to outpace reimbursement. These facts require that we 
become more efficient to continue to progress toward our goal. 
While these challenges are substantial, we believe they are solvable with sustained effort, funding, 
and collaboration with other agencies. Maui Health is committed to doing our part in this ongoing work 
to solidify health care services for our community. Your continued support is appreciated as we 
navigate these challenges and strive for a sustainable and self-reliant health care model. 
Given the information noted above, Maui Health respectfully requests the state's assistance in 
continuing to provide care to the people of Maui and Lana’i by providing an operating subsidy of $12 
million for Fiscal Year 2026 and $6 million for Fiscal Year 2027. We appreciate your consideration. 
In kindness and appreciation, 
 
Lynn Fulton 
Chief Executive Officer

Honolulu, HI 96813 
Dear Chair and Members of the Senate Ways and Means Committee, 
Aloha, 
I am writing to express my strong support for the inclusion of $5.5 million for the Waimānalo 
CARES Center and $6 million for the Magoon Research and Teaching Station in the state budget 
bill, HB 300, HD1. These allocations are crucial for our community and will have a significant 
positive impact on both the residents of Waimānalo and the broader educational and research 
efforts in Hawaii. 
Waimānalo CARES Center: 
The Waimānalo CARES Center plays a vital role in providing essential services and support to 
the local community. This funding will enable the center to enhance its programs, expand its 
reach, and improve the quality of life for residents. By investing in this center, we are investing 
in the well-being and prosperity of our community. 
Magoon Research and Teaching Station: 
The Magoon Research and Teaching Station is an important educational and research facility 
that contributes significantly to Hawaii's academic and environmental initiatives. This funding 
will support critical research projects, educational programs, and community engagement 
activities, ultimately benefiting both students and the broader community. 
I urge you to approve these allocations as they represent a wise investment in our state's future. 
These projects align with the values of community support, education, and environmental 
stewardship that are essential to Hawaii's growth and prosperity. 

Thank you for considering my testimony. I look forward to your support for these important 
initiatives. 
Mahalo, 
Kalawaiʻa Moore

Aloha Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki, and Committee Members: 
My name is Diane Ware, and I live in Volcano. I’m testifying in opposition to provisions 
in HB300 that expand mass incarceration and the building of a new $1 billion super jail.  
Budgets reveal what and who we care about. The proposed budget includes an appropriation for 
the building of a new OCCC, but we don’t need a new, $1 billion jail. Instead, we need to fund 
youth and education programs, affordable housing, job training, family strengthening and 
violence interruption programs, community-based health, treatment and reintegration programs 
rooted in evidence-based practices, and restorative justice to help us build communities that are 
safe, healthy, and equitable.  
Mahalo for your time and consideration.”

before the 
SENATE COMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS 
 
Tuesday, March 18, 2025 
10:00 AM 
State Capitol, Conference Room 211 
 
In consideration of  
HB300, HD1 
RELATING TO THE STATE BUDGET.  
 
 
Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki and members of the Committee. 
 
The Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism strongly 
supports HB300, HD1 which appropriates funds for the operating and capital 
improvement budget of the Executive Branch for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-
2027. DBEDT notes the following concerns with HD1, for your consideration. 
 
Foreign Trade Zone (BED107/BA) 
• BED107 CIP– Reinstatement of Hilo AgTech facility removed in HD1. Request of 
$6.070M Reimbursable G.O. CIP funds as working capital to construct the Hilo 
Tropical AgTech facility. The goal of this multiuse innovation center will be to 
improve small farm competitiveness and profitability, increase food security and 
resiliency, develop ag related products and intellectual property for export, create 
higher paying STEM related jobs, and keep local talent in Hawai‘i. The FTZ has a 
$6.1M federal earmark for this project but needs working capital to move the 
project forward.  
 
Land Use Commission (Proposed BED103/BED144DA) 
• BED103/BED144DA SEQ #30-001 – Typo correction.  The salary amount for the 
Executive Officer (Position No. 100982) is incorrect ($159,713) and should be 
corrected to $164,208. 
 
 

DBEDT Testimony 
March 18, 2025

Hawai‘i Community Development Authority (BED150/KA) 
• BED150 Operating  – Reinstatement of 1.00 Program Specialist V and funds of 
$100,000 each year.  Act 97, SLH 2023 established the ninety-nine leasehold 
program, which included two temporary positions through June 2025. The multi-
year endeavor required HCDA to promulgate rules for the sale of the leasehold 
interest of residential condominium units and develop one project on non-ceded 
lands within an urban redevelopment site.  The project is well underway, and the 
position is needed to administer the program.   
 
• BED150 CIP – Reinstatement of $30,000,000 total. Appropriated over two years 
FY2026: $12,102,000 and FY2027: $17,898,000 in GO Bonds to design and 
construct one low-cost residential condominium building of leasehold units for 
sale to Hawaiʻi residents on non-ceded state-owned land, withing an urban 
development site, for 99-Year Leasehold Program Phase 2 (Act 97, SLH 2023). 
 
• BED150 CIP – Reinstatement of $50,000,000 in FY 2027 in General Obligation 
Bonds for Iwilei-Kapālama Community Development District to construct 
infrastructure improvements (sewer, water, drainage, transportation, and electric) 
to support future development at Liliha Civic Center and Mayor Wright Housing. 
Design will be done with FY 2026 funds. 
 
Hawai‘i State Energy Office (BED120/SI) 
• BED120 SEQ#100-001 – Reinstatement of $20,432 to increase the base budget 
for PN 124584. An increase in the base budget is needed to attract qualified 
candidates to fill the position. This position is currently vacant.  According to the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics, the mean salary for an economist in Hawai‘i is $100k. 
The current budgeted salary is $77,521, this increase would raise the base 
budget to $98,000.  To attract and retain a qualified employee an increase in the 
budgeted salary is necessary to be competitive in the current market.  
 
• BED120 SEQ#101-001 – Reinstatement of $97,094 to appropriately fund the 
position of the Chief Energy Officer, established by the Legislature under Act 
122, SLH 2019.  Additional funds are needed to cover a payroll shortfall from the 
salary amount currently provided for the position that places the agency’s 
statutory head among the lower half of paid positions in the agency at $80,625.  
The requested salary adjustment will realign the budget with actual costs and 
allow the program to utilize OCE funds now covering the shortfall to support 
critical operational expenses. 
 
 
DBEDT kindly requests consideration of the following Operating and CIP line items.   
 
 
Operating Requests 
 
Business Development and Support Division (BED100/SM) 

DBEDT Testimony 
March 18, 2025 
Page 3 
 
• $1,450,000 each year to be used for the Healthcare Workforce Development 
Program to provide funding for two programs: 1) High School Healthcare 
Workforce Certificate and 2) CNA to LPN Glidepath Program. Funding for the 
High School Certificate Program would address the entry-level healthcare 
workforce shortage by certifying high school students in high-demand healthcare 
professions. The Glidepath Program is an earn-and-learn pathway that further 
addresses the healthcare workforce shortage which enables employers to retain 
employees as they pursue education and career advancement. 
  
• $1,595,000 each year to be used for the following purposes a) increase 
workforce capacity and market access for locally made products by supporting 
training programs that integrate workforce skills with pathways to 
commercialization, including product development, branding, and sales strategy 
as a means to enhance economic opportunities for Hawai‘i-based entrepreneurs 
and small businesses; b) upskilling opportunities for adult learners, focusing on 
industry-relevant skills to enhance employability and career transitions (partner 
with McKinley HS Adult Education); c) provide professional training for school 
meal development by equipping culinary professionals with the skills needed to 
develop nutritionally balanced, locally sourced menus for Hawai‘i’s public schools 
(in partnership with the University of Hawai‘i’s College of Tropical Agriculture and 
Human Resources (CTAHR), the Department of Education (DOE), and the 
Culinary Institute of America). 
 
Office of International Affairs (BED101/IA) 
• $2,000,000 each year to be used for the East-West Center (EWC) to provide 
Hawai‘i residents with the opportunity to participate in various activities related to 
the Asia-Pacific region.  The East-West Center will expand its outreach activities 
so that an exponential number of Hawai‘i residents can benefit from the 
outcomes of its work.  Funding would result in EWC’s ability to convene more 
conferences in Honolulu, which will foster an infusion of additional funds into the 
Hawai‘i economy by individuals who will travel from out of state to participate in 
its conferences. 
 
Land Use Commission (Proposed BED103/BED144DA) 
• 7.00 Permanent FTE; 1.00 Temporary FTE, and $786,875 each year. The Office 
of Planning and Sustainable Development (OPSD) has requested a change to 
the DBEDT program structure to add (restore) BED 103 from BED144DA, State 
Land Use Commission, to DBEDT program IDs to promote transparency and 
accountability to the public and to better align two separate programs with their 
separate missions within the state program structure.  This request would 
transfer all our LUC budget line items from BED144DA and transfer into BED103.  
This does not include funding for the existing Land Use Development 
Coordinator and request the following: 
o $186,456 ($93,226 annually) to allow funding for the existing Land Use 
Development Coordinator position (Position No. 125210) which has been 

DBEDT Testimony 
March 18, 2025 
Page 4 
 
instrumental in assisting legacy workforce housing projects to address 
barriers in the development process. 
o The salary amount for the Executive Officer (Position No. 100982) is 
incorrect ($159,713) and should be corrected to $164,208. 
 
Creative Industries Division (BED105/CI) 
• 1.00 Program Specialist V (FY26: $71,016 / FY27: $71,016). 
Lead position for CID and DBEDT’s primary workforce development liaison, 
integrating industry and education partners, ensuring alignment with the state’s 
economic diversification goals, accelerating job creation and career placement. 
Responsible for department specific industry cluster pipelines development and 
implementation. Key position to represent DBEDT on the Workforce 
Development Council (WDC) and will serve as workforce lead for the Business 
Revitalization Task Force (Permitted Interaction Group – Workforce). 
 
• 1.00 Film Industry Development Specialist V (FY26: $35,508 / FY27: $71,016 + 
fringe). Restores film permitting statutory position, critical to intra state, inter 
departmental film permitting unit. Reduction of position in SLH 2024 impacts  
productions coming into state, local productions and the inter-departmental 
approval process, as the elimination of position reduced a two person team to 
one position only.  
 
Foreign-Trade Zone (BED107/BA) 
• $120,000 Special Fund ceiling increase each year to allow for the procurement of 
one (1) additional forklift to complete fleet replacement and to cover costs of 
deferred maintenance projects, and other expenses due to inflationary increases.  
 
Hawai‘i Tourism Authority (BED113 – BED118) 
• BED114/BM: $2,773,676 each year. This program globally markets and brands 
the state of Hawai‘i and its islands as a globally competitive leisure and business 
destination to strengthen tourism’s overall contribution to Hawai‘i economy.  HTA 
will continue to be present in the major market areas of U.S., Canada, Japan, 
Korea, Oceania, Europe and China.   In addition, HTA seeks to grow the 
meetings, conventions and incentives (MCI) market.  Demand from domestic and 
international markets is expected to be soft, and there is a continued need for 
activities for quick return generation of demand, such as market saturation 
activations and co-op programs.  Strong marketing is needed to stabilize the 
domestic market and rebuild the international markets. The current FY 25 
marketing budget is only able to maintain interest and awareness levels. 
 
• BED 114/BM: $3,000,000 in FY26 for brand marketing, per Governor’s Message 
4.  There is expected softness further into 2025 and 2026.  Overcoming market 
hesitancy to visit Maui can only be accomplished through continued contact, 
frequent viewership, and relationship building. Activities will focus on short-term 
activities to increase demand, such as coop programs and in-market activations, 
and campaigns to show what to do and see. 

DBEDT Testimony

• BED 114/BM: $3,000,000 each year for Japan marketing, per Governor’s 
Message 4.  Japan market demand will continue to be down through 2027. 
Activities will focus on short-term activities to increase demand, such as coop 
programs, in-market activations, and campaigns to show what to do and see. 
 
Hawai‘i Green Infrastructure Authority (BED138/GI) 
• 1.00 Investment Fund Manager (FY 26: $211,150 / FY 27: $217,485) in special 
funds to include position #125606 (authorized by Act 40, SLH 2024) in HGIA’s 
base budget. 
 
Director’s Office (BED142/AA) 
• 1.00 Sports Tourism Manager and funds of $149,000 each year. This position will 
play a vital role in promoting Hawai‘i as a premier sports tourism destination. The 
position will be responsible for developing and implementing marketing strategies 
that attract sporting events, athletes, and spectators to the Hawaiian Islands. 
Further, this position is critical to promote sport events and activities within the 
State of Hawai‘i and to establish and continue sports networking with our sister 
states, like Las Vegas, California, and others. 
 
• $650,000 each year for MACRO will be used for critical workforce development 
initiatives that equip high school and college students with hands-on experience 
in defense, cybersecurity, and other high-demand fields. By building the 
ecosystems that can lead to mentorship, internships, and real-world training, 
MACRO will work towards strengthening Hawai‘i’s talent pipeline, ensuring 
students are prepared for competitive careers that support both the local 
economy and national security. This ecosystem will not only benefit students but 
also reinforces Hawai‘i’s role in innovation and economic growth within the 
defense sector. 
 
• $50,000 (FY26) and $50,000 (FY27) for travel related expenses 
The Department of Business, Economic Development & Tourism (DBEDT) and 
its attached agencies are responsible for project management of various 
economic development initiatives, including facilities, infrastructure, and 
equipment investments across multiple sectors. As part of this responsibility, 
travel is essential to tour and assess established facilities, meet with industry 
leaders, and learn best practices that can be applied to projects in Hawai‘i. Over 
the past year, the demand for travel has increased significantly as DBEDT 
expands its economic development portfolio. Site visits and in-person meetings 
are critical for evaluating infrastructure projects, engaging with potential partners, 
and ensuring that investments align with industry standards. This funding will 
enable DBEDT staff to participate in necessary site visits, conference 
engagements, and stakeholder discussions, which are essential for the 
successful implementation of economic development projects statewide.

• $8,508 (FY26) and $8,856 (FY27) in general funds for salary adjustment of 
Position #42670 from a Program Budget Analyst IV to V. This position is the sole 
Budget Analyst for the department and processes all budget-related matters.  
With the addition of the Agribusiness Development Corporation, Stadium 
Authority, and the Military and Community Relations Office in recent years, as 
well as the breakout of the Hawai‘i Tourism Authority into multiple program IDs, 
the increased workload and complexity of task assignment warrants a level V 
position. This position can be readily offered a higher level Budget Analyst in 
other state agencies due to the demand in the skills and expertise of this 
position. 
 
Hawai‘i Technology Development Corporation (BED143/TE) 
• $1,000,000 each year for the Manufacturing Assistance Program, Hawai‘i Small 
Business Innovation Research Program, and the Small Business Training / 
Accelerator program.  HTDC firmly believes that these grant programs play a 
crucial role in leveraging resources and fostering positive economic development 
throughout the State of Hawai‘i which will lead to job creation, sustainable 
development, and a more resilient and diverse economy for Hawai‘i. 
 
Office of Planning and Sustainable Development (BED144) 
• BED144/DA – Transfer out 7.00 Permanent FTE; 1.00 Temporary FTE, and 
$786,875 each year to BED103/DA. The Office of Planning and Sustainable 
Development (OPSD) has requested a change to the DBEDT program structure 
to add (restore) BED 103, State Land Use Commission (LUC), to DBEDT 
program IDs to promote transparency and accountability to the public and to 
better align two separate programs with their separate missions within the state 
program structure. 
 
• BED144/PZ - $255,964 each year for Coastal Zone Management Federal Fund 
Ceiling Increase. Increase appropriation ceiling due to Federal Grant continuing 
support and inflation. 
 
• BED144/PL - 1.00 Special Funds Project Coordinator and administration costs  
for the second year (FY 2026) of the Hawai‘i State Planning Act Phase 2. 
Additional funding is required to continue this multi-year process to update HRS 
226 pursuant to Act 36, SLH 2024. 
 
• BED144/PL – 3.00 exempt, filled, temporary FTE and $282,060 each year.  
Personnel funds are needed to retain staff to continue to support an Economic 
Development District (EDD) designation to unlock additional federal dollars and 
support for economic development and resilience projects across the state. 
Failure to fund these positions will result in the loss of staffing required to 
maintain the EDD designation and benefits. 
 
• BED144/PL - 1.00 Permanent FTE (FY 26: $35,508 / FY 27: $71,016) for the 
Statewide Sustainability Branch to support statewide climate and sustainability

coordination/implementation. Established by HRS §225M-8 (Act 45, SLH 2020), 
the Branch coordinates and implements policies, evaluates legislation, and 
advises the Governor, Legislature, and agencies on sustainability and climate 
resilience. Currently, the Branch has only 1.00 FTE (State Sustainability 
Coordinator). This request would expand capacity to meet climate resilience 
demands.  
 
• BED144/PL - $45,570 each year to restore full-year funding for 1.00 FTE 
permanent Planning Program Manager #11310. The personnel costs for this 
permanent civil service position were reduced by five months of salary when the 
incumbent was appointed by Governor Green to serve as the Director of the 
Office of Planning and Sustainable Development for a term-limited appointment 
with return rights to the position.  The salary needs to be restored to 12 months’ 
salary in order for the incumbent to exercise return rights. 
 
• BED144/PZ – Convert 5.00 Permanent FTE from federal funds to general funds.  
This would include an increase of General Funds of $411,408, and a decrease of 
Federal funds of $663,629 each year for the Coastal Zone Management Program 
(CZM).  From 1975 to approx. 2009, the positions were general funded. In 2009, 
the positions were converted to federal funding following a decline in State 
revenues. The provision of federal funds from NOAA was temporary, with a 
condition that the State take active steps to restore State funding for the 
positions. The restoration of general funds for the positions ensures that the 
State can satisfy the condition(s) of the federal cooperative agreement to 
maintain eligibility for CZM to receive its annual award of $2.5 million. 
 
Agribusiness Development Corporation (BED170/KB) 
• $120,000 revolving fund ceiling increase in FY26 for Attorney General support.  
The requested position is designed to address the encumbrances associated 
with the acquisition of the Mililani Tech Park by the ADC. The work will identify if 
any alternatives to a bridge exist, and address the extensive electrical, sewer and 
expanded freeway access to the park that are associated with the single lot.  
With new economic pressures, current tenants are requesting new and expanded 
use of ceded lands. ADC needs an additional AG to determine if these new uses 
are within the Executive Orders that came with the ceded lands, implication to 
ceded land revenues and work with DLNR in developing new precedent 
governing the use of ceded lands. Some of these queries have included the 
ability to crush rocks that are found when tilling up soil, the ability to sell sand, 
and dirt, and the ability to use the lands for purposes outside of agriculture which 
benefit the economic, environmental and social benefit of the people of Hawai‘i- 
in the ADC Statute. Tenants are asking if grant money earned for modifications 
or permanent changes to the land are revenues shared with OHA & DHHL. ADC 
is needing expertise in reviewing a Memorandum of Agreement that is in year 18

alternative for this request.   
 
• (1) PERM FTE Crop Commodity Coordinator – Salary $85,765 (FY26) and 
$83,315 (FY27) 
The requested full-time permanent position of Crop Commodity Coordinator will 
support Hawai‘i’s agricultural sector by providing strategic guidance, 
coordination, and market expansion for local crop commodities. This position will 
focus on identifying high-value crops, improving supply chain efficiencies, and 
developing strategies to enhance Hawai‘i’s agricultural competitiveness in both 
local and export markets. With the state’s goal of doubling local food production, 
there is an urgent need to strengthen coordination among farmers, processors, 
and distributors. The Crop Commodity Coordinator will play a critical role in 
supporting growers, facilitating market linkages, and addressing production 
challenges such as pest and disease management, mechanization, and 
sustainability practices. This position will also assist in leveraging federal and 
state programs to support crop innovation and market access, ensuring a stable 
and resilient agricultural economy for Hawai‘i. 
 
• $500,000 revolving fund ceiling in FY26 for special counsel costs.   
The Special Counsel is requested for immediate and specialized expertise in the 
Clean Water Act, NPDES, EPA and environmental litigation not available in the 
existing AG office. The counsel needs to define a strategy and drafting a 
response to the HDOH NPDES draft permit by 5/12/25. The response is critical in 
countering the exponential increase in sampling, testing and monitoring, potential 
fine of $60,000/day for noncompliance, inclusion of Kaua‘i County with ADC in 
the permit and upholding exemptions available to agriculture. If the draft permit 
remains as written, it will be the new level of performance required for HDOA, 
DHHL, DLNR and all large land owners across the state and significantly 
increase the cost of local food production while hampering the state’s goal of 
increasing diversified agriculture. 
 
• $11,591,397 revolving fund ceiling in FY26 for compliance with the National 
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permits. 
These are the costs for the water sampling, testing and monitoring in order to 
comply with the conditions of the HDOH NPDES Permit draft as written.  The 
state can expect similar costs for all state-owned water systems across the state. 
 
Stadium Authority (BED180/SA) 
• $49,500,000 in FY26 to increase the Stadium Development Special Fund (SDSF) 
ceiling to allow Stadium Authority to allot and expend the funds appropriated in 
Act 248, Session Laws of Hawai‘i 2022, and authorized by proviso 17.3, which 

DBEDT Testimony

permitted the deposit of a $49.5M appropriation into the SDSF. The ceiling 
increase would enable the Stadium Authority to expend funds toward advancing 
the New Aloha Stadium Entertainment District (NASED) project. Failure to secure 
this increase could delay the execution of the stadium development and 
operation agreement and other NASED project documents.

design of a liquid egg processing facility to strengthen Hawai‘i’s food security and 
self-sufficiency. This facility will play a crucial role in addressing the state's fragile 
egg production infrastructure by processing and distributing locally sourced eggs 
in a scalable and efficient manner. The recent closure of local egg farms and the 
impact of avian influenza have highlighted the vulnerability of Hawai‘i’s egg 
supply chain. The state's heavy reliance on imported eggs has created a supply 
bottleneck that makes local food security highly susceptible to external 
disruptions. A prime example of this challenge is the Hawai‘i Department of 
Education’s (DOE) school meal program, which imports significant quantities of 
liquid eggs to meet nutritional needs for students. According to DOE procurement 
data, multiple schools purchase liquid eggs from mainland suppliers, 
demonstrating a continued demand that could be met with local production. The 
lack of a processing facility prevents local farmers from competing in this market, 
forcing the state to depend on costly imports. By investing in a liquid egg facility, 
Hawai‘i can: 
o Increase local egg production capacity and processing efficiency. 
o Reduce dependency on mainland imports and enhance food security. 
o Provide a stable market for local poultry farmers, creating economic 
opportunities. 
o Support state agencies like DOE in sourcing local, high-quality eggs for 
school meals. 
 
This investment aligns with Hawai‘i’s broader agricultural strategy to enhance 
local food production, reduce costs, and build resilience in the state’s food supply 
chain. 
 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify.

Sexual and reproductive healthcare and education is one of the most effective--monetarily and 
physiologically--investments that Hawaii can make. Understanding how our bodies and minds 
work can help us recognize possible signs of disease progression, including reproductive cancers 
and STIs, prevent unwanted pregnancies and bodily harm, and destigmatize uncomfortable 
topics, such as sexual dysfunction, infertility, contraception, abortion, and violence against 
women. The lack of investment can exacerbate disparities between working class individuals and 
families by continuing the cycle of disadvantage. Without proper education and resources, an 
individual may not see the signs of disease progression, menstrual cycle phases, and violence, 
keeping them in a disadvantaged place, where they may require more funds and resources to 
manage or treat. Preventative care, starting at education and advocacy, can save years of 
confusion, pain, and frustration for the individual and millions of dollars for the state. Starting 
with sexual and reproductive health is a paramount step to bettering the whole of women's 
health.

President and Chief Executive Officer 
Kauaʻi Island Utility Cooperative

Tuesday, March 18, 2025; 10:00 am 
Conference Room #211 & Videoconference 
 
 
 
House Bill No. 300 HD1 - RELATING TO THE STATE BUDGET 
 
To the Honorable Chair Donovan M. Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Sharon Y. Moriwaki, and Members of the Committee: 
 
Kauaʻi Island Utility Cooperative (KIUC) is a not-for-profit utility providing electrical service to more than 34,000 
commercial and residential members. 
 
KIUC strongly supports continued funding through HB 300, program number LNR404, SEQ # 104-001 (Executive 
Request: Add Funds for Water Resources LNR404/GC), for the Hawai‘i Mesonet, a network of advanced weather 
stations providing real-time data essential for wildfire prevention, infrastructure protection, and public safety. 
 
As Kauaʻi’s electric cooperative, KIUC faces growing wildfire risks due to dry, windy conditions exacerbated by 
climate change. Reliable weather data is critical for assessing fire danger, managing vegetation near power lines, 
and making informed decisions about de-energizing lines when necessary. The 2012 Kōkeʻe wildfire, which 
burned over 3,000 acres, and recent brush fires in West Kauaʻi highlight the urgent need for better localized fire 
weather data. Hawai‘i Mesonet stations help track wind speed, humidity, and fuel moisture—key factors in 
wildfire behavior and prevention. 
 
Severe rainfall events also threaten our infrastructure. The historic April 2018 floods, which dropped nearly 50 
inches of rain in 24 hours, demonstrated the need for accurate precipitation and streamflow monitoring to 
protect substations, power poles, and hydroelectric facilities. 
 
The Hawai‘i Mesonet directly supports KIUC’s mission by enhancing wildfire prevention and response in a number 
of ways: 
 
• 
Enhancing Wildfire Prevention and Response: Real-time fire weather data helps KIUC assess risks and 
adjust power operations, reducing the need for precautionary shutoffs;  
• 
Protecting Critical Infrastructure – Advanced weather monitoring allows KIUC to anticipate and mitigate 
flooding impacts on substations and power lines; and  
• 
Supporting Renewable Energy Planning – Data on wind speeds, cloud cover, and precipitation informs 
efficient integration of Kaua‘i’s renewable energy resources.

As Kauaʻi moves toward a more resilient and sustainable energy future, accurate weather data is essential to 
safeguarding our grid. We urge the Legislature to support continued funding for this vital program. 
 
Mahalo for your consideration.

My name is Noel and I live in Honolulu. 
I'm testifying in opposition to provisions in HB300 that expand mass incarceration and the 
building of a new $1 billion super jail. 
Budgets reveal what and who we care about. The proposed budget includes an appropriation for 
the building of a new OCCC, but we don't need a new, $1 billion jail. 
Instead, we need to fund youth and education programs, affordable housing, job training, 
diversion infrastructure, family strengthening and violence interruption programs, community-
based health, treatment and reintegration programs rooted in evidence-based practices, and 
restorative justice to help us build communities that are safe, healthy, and equitable. 
Mahalo for your consideration.

Aloha, 
My name is Andy and I live in Honolulu. As a member of the Reimagining Public Safety in 
Hawai'i Coalition, I support a state budget that increases investments in services and programs 
that build safe and healthy communities. 
We are respectfully requesting that you significantly increase investments in the following areas, 
which are proven by research and data to dramatically increase safety by diverting residents out 
of the criminal justice system and addressing the root causes of poverty, crime, and violence. 
• 
Permanent supportive housing and transitional housing 
• 
Community-based mental health services 
• 
Youth programs 
• 
Vocational/employment training for living wage jobs 
• 
Restorative Justice and Ho'oponopono 
At least 40% of all people in jail in Hawai'i are homeless. There is consensus among justice 
system actors - including judges, prosecutors, and service providers - that people suffering from 
mental illness and substance abuse disorder should be diverted out of jail and into treatment and 
housing. This would dramatically shrink the jail population, but to succeed, the state must fund 
diversion infrastructure.  
We are also in a time of fiscal crisis, and the state cannot afford to adequately fund diversion 
while also spending enormous amounts on expanding jails and prisons. Given this reality, please 
remove appropriations for the following projects. 
• 
$30 MIL for planning and design of OCCC jail 
• 
$10 for DCR Statewide Master Plan 
• 
Millions more for jail and prison expansion 
As our elected representatives, you have the opportunity to finally move our state past the failed 
approach of funding more policing and incarceration which has not made us safer, toward the 
proven strategy of funding services and programs that address the root causes of poverty, crime, 
and violence. 

Mahalo for the opportunity to provide testimony.

I'm testifying in opposition to provisions in HB300 that expand mass incarceration and the 
building of a new $1 billion super jail. 
Budgets reveal what and who we care about. The proposed budget includes an appropriation for 
the building of a new occc, but we don't need a new, $1 billion jail. 
Hawaiʻi currently does not have adequate funding or resources allocated for reentry programs, 
which are essential to get individuals set up for success to live long, healthy lives. As it stands, 
tax payers pay $112,000 anually per incarcerated individual, compared to the $30,000 it costs to 
provide permanent supportive housing.  
We need to prioritize funding youth and education programs, affordable housing, job training, 
diversion infrastructure, family strengthening and violence interruption programs, community-
based health, treatment and reintegration programs rooted in evidence-based practices, and 
restorative justice to help us build communities that are safe, healthy, and equitable. 
Mahalo for your consideration.

TESTIMONY FROM THE STONEWALL CAUCUS OF THE DEMOCRATIC 
PARTY OF HAWAI‘I 
 
 
SENATE COMMITTEE ON COMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS 
 
March 18, 2025 
 
 
Testimony in Strong Support of House Bill 300 HD1  
RELATING TO THE STATE BUDGET 
 
Aloha Chair, Vice Chair, and esteemed Members of the Committee: 
 
My name is Abby Simmons, Chair of the Stonewall Caucus of the Democratic Party of 
Hawai‘i, and I am testifying on behalf of our Caucus in strong support of HB300 HD1, which 
appropriates funds for the operating and capital improvement budget of the Executive Branch 
for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027. 
 
 
A critical component of this bill is the allocation of $3,000,000 for each fiscal year to support 
reproductive health and family planning services.  This funding is essential to maintain 
access to comprehensive sexual and reproductive health care for Hawaiʻi residents, 
particularly those served by safety net providers like Planned Parenthood. 
 
 
Safety net providers play a vital role in delivering essential health services, including 
contraception, cancer screenings, STI testing and treatment, and prenatal care. They ensure 
that all individuals, regardless of income or insurance status, have access to necessary 
health care. The proposed funding will help these providers continue offering high-quality 
care and address the unique needs of our diverse communities. 
 
 
Without this financial support, many safety net providers may face significant challenges, 
potentially leading to reduced services or closures. Such outcomes would have devastating 
effects on Hawaiʻi residents, especially those in underserved areas who rely heavily on these 
services. Ensuring stable funding for reproductive health and family planning is not only a 
matter of public health but also one of equity and social justice. 
 
 

Stonewall Caucus Testimony in Strong Support of House Bill 300 HD1 Relating to the State Budget 
 
 
THE STONEWALL CAUCUS OF THE  
 
DEMOCRATIC PARTY OF HAWAI‘I 
 
PAGE 2 
I urge the committee to approve the proposed funding in HB300 HD1 to safeguard access to 
essential health care services for all Hawaiʻi residents. 
 
 
Mahalo for your time and consideration. 
 
 
Respectfully, 
 
 
Abby Simmons (she/her)

 The release of millions of Wolbachia-bacteria-infected mosquitoes on our fragile ecosystems on 
Maui and Kaua‘i is irresponsible and dangerous.  No studies have been done on the potential 
significant impacts of these projects or on the serious risks to the health of our islands’ people, 
wildlife, and ‘āina. No environmental impact statement (EIS) has been completed for any island. 
There are many concerns for this reckless and experimental program. 
I urge you to use caution and do not implement this program. 
Thank you.

Aloha Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki, and Committe Members:  
My name is Marc Gamboa and I live in Kaimuki. I'm tesityfing in opposition to provisions in 
HB300 that expand mass incarceration and the building of a new $1 billion super jail.  
Budgets reveal what and who we care about. The proposed budget includes an appropriation for 
the building fo a new OCCC, but we don't need a new $1 billion jail. This amount of money for a 
jail would be a huge mistake and stain on Hawaii's identity. 
Instead, we need to fund youth and education programs, affordable housing, job training, 
diversion infrastructure, family strengthening and violence interruption programs, community-
based health, treatment and reintergration programs rooted in evidence-based practices, and 
restorative justice to help us build communities that are safe, healthy, and equitable. Let's address 
the root of this issue of crime by investing in actual solutions to crime. $1 billion for a new jail 
would be a slap in the face of our population and would not address the root of crime in Hawaii. 
Mahalo for your consideration.

I am against releasing dangerous mosquito experiments on any of the Hawaiian Islands and I'm 
against sending any money towards this reckless experiment and want it stopped immediately 
before it harms our people and our ecosystem. It's foolish and should not be done on our island. 
How foolish to take such a dangerous risk. I hope they get the names of those that agree to doing 
this and announce it to the public so we know who are resposible for doing this.

TESTIMONY OF KAWIKA UYEHARA, DEPUTY 
DEPARTMENT OF WATER SUPPLY, COUNTY OF HAWAII 
 
HEARING BEFORE THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS 
DATE:
Tuesday, March 18, 2025
TIME: 
10:00 a.m. 
PLACE:
Conference Room 211 & Videoconference
 
HB 300 HD1 - RELATING TO THE STATE BUDGET 
LNR404, SEQ # 104-001  
 
Honorable Chair Dela Cruz, Vice-Chair Moriwaki, and committee members, 
 
The enhancements to Hawaiʻi’s climate and hydrologic monitoring capacity proposed in this bill 
will greatly assist us in fulfilling our mission as stewards and stakeholders associated with managing 
water and environmental resources effectively. Therefore, the County of Hawaii, Department of Water 
Supply (DWS) strongly supports HB 300 HD1, LNR404, SEQ #104-001.  
 
Reliable, real-time weather data is essential for managing Hawaiʻi Island’s vast and diverse 
water systems. The Hawaiʻi County Department of Water Supply (DWS) depends on accurate climate 
monitoring to address the island’s highly variable rainfall, prolonged droughts, and extreme weather 
events. The Hawai‘i Mesonet provides the detailed environmental data necessary to safeguard our 
water supply, support conservation efforts, and strengthen infrastructure resilience. The Hawaiʻi 
Mesonet is critical to DWS operations, providing data that helps:  
 
 
Enhance Water Conservation & Supply Management – Real-time rainfall and soil moisture 
data improve groundwater recharge assessments, ensuring responsible aquifer use and 
reducing unnecessary pumping.  
 
Improve Drought Preparedness – Long-term precipitation and temperature trends inform 
adaptive water management strategies, helping DWS anticipate shortages and allocate 
resources effectively.  
 
Support Infrastructure Resilience – Temperature and soil moisture data help identify areas 
where aging pipelines are at greater risk of leaks or breaks, allowing for targeted maintenance 
and upgrades.  
 
Manage Wildfire Risk – Many of DWS’s sources and infrastructure are in fire-prone areas. 
Mesonet stations track wind, temperature, and humidity conditions, aiding in wildfire risk 
mitigation and emergency planning.  
 
With 27 Mesonet stations already operating on Hawaiʻi Island, this network has proven 
invaluable in monitoring changing weather patterns and protecting our water supply. Continued 
investment in the Hawaiʻi Mesonet will ensure that DWS has the data needed to plan for future 
challenges, maintain critical infrastructure, and safeguard water resources for generations to come.

The Department of Water Supply is an Equal Opportunity provider and employer. 
We urge the Legislature to support continued funding through bill HB300 HD1, program 
number LNR404, SEQ #104-001 for this vital program.  
 
Please feel free to contact me at (808) 961-8050 or via email at dws@hawaiidws.org with any 
questions you may have regarding DWS’ comments. Thank you for your time and consideration of our 
testimony on HB 300 HD1.

Aloha, 
Please fund $3 million in family planning to ensure low-income and underinsured patients can 
continue accessing reproductive healthcare. Please do NOT fund $30 million for planning the 
proposed new jail to replace OCCC and $10 million for a 10-year Department of Corrections 
Statewide Master Plan.  We should be funding healthcare, public education, free meals, and 
affordable housing, not a new prison. 
Mahalo nui,

Re: Comments only regarding HB 300 HD1 
Dear Senator Donovan M. Dela Cruz, Chair, Senator Sharon Y. Moriwaki, Vice Chair 
and Members of the Committee: 
Members of Indivisible Hawaiʻi thank you for this opportunity to submit comments on HB 
300 HD1 Relating to the State Budget. 
We support funding $3 million in family planning to ensure low-income and 
underinsured patients can continue accessing reproductive healthcare. We do NOT 
support funding $30 million for planning the proposed new jail to replace OCCC, nor  
$10 million for a 10-year Department of Corrections Statewide Master Plan.  We should 
prioritize funding healthcare, public education, free meals, and affordable 
housing vs. a new prison. 
 
Sexual and reproductive health care is one of the most powerful and cost-effective 
investments Hawaiʻi can make. For every $1 invested in family planning, Hawaiʻi saves 
at least $7 on unintended pregnancy costs and long-term social costs – savings that 
can be directed towards other critical services. 
 
Hawai’i’s safety net providers are facing rising costs, workforce shortages, and 
increased patient volumes. On Neighbor Islands, access to reproductive health 
care is especially dire.  On top of these challenges, we all know the hostile 
administration in Washington, D.C. is threatening to make devastating cuts to critical 
health care services.  Please act now to protect Hawai’i women and families. 
 
Sincerely,  
Indivisible Hawaiʻi  
 
We’re a grassroots movement of thousands of local Indivisible groups with a mission to 
elect progressive leaders, rebuild our democracy, and defeat the Trump agenda.  In 
Hawaiʻi, we have ten groups across four islands, representing over a thousand pro-
democracy citizens.
