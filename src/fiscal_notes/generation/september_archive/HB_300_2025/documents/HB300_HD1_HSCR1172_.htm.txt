Your Committee on
Finance finds that the indicators for the economic outlook of the State show
relatively moderate growth.
However,
challenges remain as the State prepares to deal with potential impacts from
changing federal policy.
On January 6, 2025, State
Economist, Dr. Eugene Tian, briefed
your Committee that while the state economy is buoyed by construction,
real estate, and a stable labor market, it is still facing challenges,
including:
(1)
Higher than national average inflation;
(2)
A shrinking labor force; and
(3)
Slow visitor industry recovery.
On January 25,
2025, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a budget resolution that
proposed a potential $2 trillion cut in federal spending impacting safety net
programs such as Medicaid, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP),
and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF).
Should these reductions come to fruition, the State
will need flexibility in the budget to respond.
On February 28,
2025, the University of Hawaii Economic Research Organization (UHERO) warned
that "Hawaii's economic growth is threatened by federal disruptions.
While tax cuts may provide some stimulus this
year, the Administration's actions—including tariffs, mass deportations, and
spending cuts—will impose significant drag thereafter.
The clearest near-term risk is federal
layoffs, which will result in a loss of more than 2,000 local jobs, fully
offsetting growth in construction and the lift from local tax cuts.
Together with other federal policies, this
places the Hawaii economy at risk of recession over the next few years."
In light of these concerns, your Committee focused
on core and safety net programs and prepared for flexibility within the budget
by providing:
(1)
$200,000,000 in FY26 for deposit into the Emergency
and Budget Reserve Fund;
(2)
$465,084 and five positions in FY27 for Office
of Federal Awards Management;
(3)
$20,990,000
in FY26 and FY27 for summer school;
(4)
$10,000,000
in FY26 and FY27 for skilled nursing services;
(5)
$80,545,000 in FY26 and $69,597,400 in FY27
for Hawaii Health Systems Corporations Regions and implementation of Epic
Systems for East Hawaii;
(6)
$12,000,000 in FY26 and $6,000,000 in FY27 for
Maui Health System;
(7)
$1,838,210 in FY26 and $3,305,926 in FY27 and twenty-one
positions for certified community behavioral health clinic certification for
Oahu, Maui, Hawaii, and Kauai Community Mental Health Centers;
(8)
$13,000,000 in
FY26 and FY27
for locum tenens contracts for Hawaii State
Hospital;
(9)
$1,700,000 in
FY26 and FY27
for contracted services for family planning and
preventative health services;
(10)
$250,000 in
FY26 and FY27
for the State Rent Supplement Program;
(11)
$250,000 in
FY26 and FY27
for the federal Section 8 Program;
(12)
$3,750,000 in
FY26 and FY27
for the Housing First Program;
(13)
$3,750,000 in
FY26 and FY27
for the Rapid Re-Housing Program;
(14)
$6,500,000 in
FY26 and FY27
for Applied Behavioral Analysis to increase
provider payment rates;
(15)
$29,455,181 in
FY26 and FY27
to sustain increased reimbursement rates for most
medical professional services; and
(16)
$605,000 in
FY26 and FY27
for Family Resource Centers.
Upon consideration,
your Committee has amended this measure by:
(1)
Appropriating the following for operating and
capital improvement expenses:

this report, your Committee is in accord with the intent and purpose of H.B.
No. 300, as amended herein, and recommends that it pass Second Reading in the form

submitted on behalf of the members of the Committee on Finance,
