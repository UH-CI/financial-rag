{
  "overview": "This measure's scope has been significantly narrowed to focus on patient access by repealing the in-person provider consultation requirement and allowing applicants to make a one-time cannabis purchase while awaiting their registration card. Provisions from the previous version, including the creation of a cannabis cultivator license, inter-dispensary sales, criminal penalties for unlicensed operations, and an appropriation for enforcement, have been removed. The bill has been amended with a defective effective date of July 1, 3000 (HB302_HD1) to facilitate further discussion.",
  "appropriations": "This version of the measure removes the previously included appropriation from the Medical Cannabis Registry and Regulation Special Fund to the Department of the Attorney General. The bill no longer appropriates any funds.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The primary assumption is that the measure carries no immediate fiscal impact due to its amended defective effective date of July 1, 3000 (HB302_HD1). Therefore, all financial projections are zero for the foreseeable future. No cost estimation methods or data sources for implementation are provided in the documents.",
  "agency_impact": "The previously described impact on the Department of the Attorney General regarding enforcement has been removed from the bill. The Department of Health is now tasked with facilitating temporary purchase authorizations for new applicants (HB302_HD1). Both the Department of Health and the Department of the Attorney General submitted testimony expressing concerns about potential legal liabilities and regulatory conflicts arising from the proposed changes (HB302_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_).",
  "economic_impact": "The measure's economic focus is now on mitigating the decline in registered medical cannabis patients, which has decreased by over fifteen per cent between August 2021 and November 2024 (HB302_HD1). By reducing administrative hurdles, the bill aims to retain and attract patients to the regulated state dispensary system rather than the illicit market. Provisions related to inter-dispensary sales are no longer included.",
  "policy_impact": "The policy scope is now limited to patient access issues, specifically achieving telehealth parity for medical cannabis certifications and reducing registration delays. The previous policy changes creating a new cultivator license and establishing criminal offenses for unlicensed operators have been eliminated from this version of the measure. The bill now amends sections 329-123, 329-126, and 453-1.3 of the Hawaii Revised Statutes to implement these focused changes (HB302_HD1).",
  "revenue_sources": "As this measure no longer contains an appropriation, the Medical Cannabis Registry and Regulation Special Fund is no longer identified as a funding source for new state activities. The bill does not introduce any new revenue sources. The fiscal impact is neutral.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The measure will have no fiscal implications within the six-year planning period. The amendment changing the effective date to July 1, 3000 (HB302_HD1), defers any potential costs indefinitely. All previously considered fiscal impacts related to enforcement and new licensing have been removed from the current version of the bill.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The previously noted decrease in the Medical Cannabis Registry and Regulation Special Fund's balance is no longer applicable, as the appropriation has been removed from the bill. There is a potential for a minor, unquantified increase in patient registration fee revenue if the measure successfully increases participation in the program. However, the immediate impact on operating revenue is neutral.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The primary updates from the previous fiscal note are the complete removal of the appropriation for the Department of the Attorney General and the elimination of all provisions related to creating a new cultivator license and establishing criminal penalties. The bill's scope has narrowed to focus exclusively on patient access by allowing telehealth for initial consultations and authorizing temporary purchases for new applicants. Most significantly, a defective effective date of July 1, 3000 (HB302_HD1) has been added, which means the measure has no foreseeable fiscal impact."
