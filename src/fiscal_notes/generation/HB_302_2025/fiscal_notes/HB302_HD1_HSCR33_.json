  "agency_impact": "The Department of the Attorney General is concerned that allowing applicants for the medical use of cannabis to purchase cannabis before the DOH approves their application could expose ineligible individuals to liability. [2] If the application is denied, the applicant may already possess cannabis without legal authorization. [2] The Department of Health (DOH) has concern that authorizing purchases of medical cannabis prior to the approval of their application will cause more potential harm than benefit, which may include exposing patients to arrest, leading to purchases over the legal limit, and creating inaccuracies in inventory control systems. [2] [2] [2] [2] Both the Attorney General and the DOH note that removing the in-person medical consultation requirement for certification would conflict with the existing telehealth law, section 453-1.3(c), HRS. [2] [2]",
  "economic_impact": "The uninsured and uncontrolled cost of a medical cannabis card can range from $100.00 (HB302_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_.PDF.txt) to $300.00 (HB302_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_.PDF.txt) omit the $38.50 (HB302_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_.PDF.txt) state fee, depending on the provider and island. [2] Testimony suggests that with limited physician participation, mandatory in-person visits, and high cost of entry, the program has become unaffordable and unattractive. [2] Another impacting factor has been the explosion of viable cannabis products that are being sold under the guise of hemp at businesses that allow immediate access as they do not require a medical card. [2]",
  "policy_impact": "This measure, as amended, repeals the requirement that a provider-patient relationship be established in person for purposes of obtaining a certification for medical cannabis. [4] The bill amends section 453-1.3, Hawaii Revised Statutes, by removing language that requires an in-person consultation for certifying a patient for the medical use of cannabis. [3] Your Committee has amended this measure by changing the effective date to July 1, 3000, to encourage further discussion. [4]",

  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "New testimony from the Department of the Attorney General and the Department of Health raises concerns about legal liability, potential for illegal possession by denied applicants, and inaccuracies in dispensary inventory systems. [2] [2] [2] The updated bill, H.B. 302 H.D. 1, now directly amends section 453-1.3, Hawaii Revised Statutes, to resolve conflicts with existing telehealth laws noted in testimony. [3] Testimony provides new, specific data on the economic burden to patients, indicating the cost for a medical cannabis card can range from $100.00 (HB302_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_.PDF.txt) to $300.00 (HB302_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_.PDF.txt) plus a state fee of $38.50 (HB302_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_.PDF.txt). [2] A significant policy update is the amendment of the bill's effective date to July 1, 3000, to encourage further discussion. [4]"
