  "overview": "The purpose of this measure is to repeal the requirement that a provider-patient relationship be established in person for purposes of obtaining a certification for medical cannabis and allow applicants or primary caregivers to temporarily purchase medical cannabis after the submission of the applicant's certification form (HB302_HD1_HSCR33_). The legislature finds that registration for the medical cannabis program has decreased, with the number of patients having decreased over fifteen per cent from 35,444 in August 2021 to 30,035 by November 2024 (HB302_HD1). This Act aims to expand access to care by easing some of the burdens upon qualifying patients and primary caregivers (HB302_HD1).",

  "agency_impact": "The department of health office of medical cannabis control and regulation shall facilitate the temporary authorization for applicants and primary caregivers to make a one-time purchase of cannabis (HB302_HD1). The Department of the Attorney General is concerned that allowing applicants to purchase cannabis before their application is approved could expose ineligible individuals to liability, as the bill makes no provision for what happens to illegally possessed cannabis if the application is denied (HB302_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_). The Department of Health has concern that authorizing purchases prior to application approval will cause more potential harm than benefit, citing risks such as exposing patients to arrest and creating inaccuracies in dispensary inventory control systems (HB302_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_).",
  "economic_impact": "Your Committee finds that access for qualifying patients and primary caregivers to medical cannabis remains challenging due to limited access to medical providers, delays in obtaining authorizations for access, and a thriving illicit market (HB302_HD1_HSCR33_). Testimony states that the uninsured and uncontrolled cost of a medical cannabis card can range from $100.00 (HB302_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_.PDF.txt) to $300.00 (HB302_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_.PDF.txt) omit the $38.50 (HB302_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_.PDF.txt) state fee, depending on the provider and island (HB302_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_). Reducing administrative barriers is intended to support the State's medical cannabis program and encourage patients to access medical cannabis in a manner that ensures patient safety, product safety, and public safety (HB302_HD1_HSCR33_).",
  "policy_impact": "This measure repeals the requirement that a provider-patient relationship be established in person, allowing a bona fide physician-patient relationship to be established via telehealth without an initial in-person consultation (HB302_HD1). It allows an applicant or primary caregiver to use the submission of the applicant's form as proof and documentation authorizing a one-time purchase of cannabis from a licensed dispensary before receipt of confirmed registration (HB302_HD1). The Department of the Attorney General notes that removing the in-person consultation requirement would conflict with the existing telehealth law, section 453-1.3(c), HRS, which explicitly requires an in-person consultation for certifying a patient for the medical use of cannabis (HB302_TESTIMONY_HLT_01-29-25_).",

  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The Committee on Health has amended this measure by changing the effective date to July 1, 3000, to encourage further discussion (HB302_HD1_HSCR33_). This change removes any fiscal implications for the foreseeable future. No costs, staffing changes, or recurring expenses are anticipated within the standard six-year fiscal outlook period. The new version of the bill does not contain any appropriations or revenue-generating mechanisms that would have a fiscal impact.",

  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The scope of the bill has been significantly narrowed from the version described in the previous fiscal note. Provisions to amend the definitions of \"debilitating medical condition\" and \"waiting room,\" authorize dispensary-to-dispensary sales, establish a cannabis cultivator license, and create new criminal penalties have been removed. Consequently, the appropriation for the Department of the Attorney General to enforce nuisance laws, funded by the Medical Cannabis Registry and Regulation Special Fund, has also been eliminated. The current measure focuses exclusively on repealing the in-person consultation requirement and allowing a temporary one-time purchase for applicants. Finally, the effective date has been changed to July 1, 3000, which postpones any fiscal impact indefinitely, unlike the previous version's effective dates."
