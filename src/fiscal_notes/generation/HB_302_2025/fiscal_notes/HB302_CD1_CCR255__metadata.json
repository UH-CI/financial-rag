It clarifies conditions for medical cannabis use, authorizes establishing a provider-patient relationship via telehealth for written certifications, and allows the sale of hemp products and accessories at retail dispensing locations. Additionally, the measure establishes criminal penalties for unlicensed dispensaries, authorizes expenditures for nuisance abatement, and creates a cannabis cultivator license to be issued by DOH.\",\n  \"appropriations\": \"The legislative document specifies there is appropriated out of the medical cannabis registry and regulation special fund the sum of $750,000 (HB302_CD1_.HTM.txt) or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2025-2026 and the same sum or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2026-2027 for the department of the attorney general. These funds are to enforce, and mitigate nuisances relating to, illegal cannabis and hemp products and chapter 329D, Hawaii Revised Statutes. The appropriation is intended to establish, recruit, and hire four full-time equivalent (4.0 FTE) investigator V positions, one full-time equivalent (1.0 FTE) investigator IV position, and one full-time equivalent (1.0 FTE) analyst position.\",\n  \"assumptions_and_methodology\": \"\",\n  \"agency_impact\": \"The measure authorizes the Department of Health to inspect a qualifying patient's medical records and to suspend or revoke the ability to issue a written certification for non-compliance.

Beginning January 1, 2028, the Department of Health will be responsible for issuing and regulating a new cannabis cultivator license.\",\n  \"economic_impact\": \"The legislature finds that registration for the medical cannabis program has decreased over fifteen per cent from a peak of 35,444 card-holding patients in August 2021 to 30,035 by November 2024, indicating a shift away from licensed dispensaries. This measure authorizes the sale of hemp products and accessories at retail dispensing locations, potentially creating a new revenue stream for licensed dispensaries.
