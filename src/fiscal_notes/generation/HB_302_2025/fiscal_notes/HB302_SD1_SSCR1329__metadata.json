This shift away from licensed dispensaries is attributed to administrative barriers, delays in registering, and the ease and lower costs in obtaining cannabis elsewhere (HB302_SD1). The Department of Health noted that a removed provision for immediate purchases posed significant risks, as it would lead to inaccuracies in sales tracking and patient verification systems at state-licensed dispensaries (HB302_HD2_TESTIMONY_HHS-CPN_03-19-25_).\",\n  \"policy_impact\": \"This measure now amends the definition of \\\"debilitating medical condition\\\" to any condition determined by the certifying physician or advanced practice registered nurse to be appropriate for the medical use of cannabis (HB302_SD1_SSCR1329_).
