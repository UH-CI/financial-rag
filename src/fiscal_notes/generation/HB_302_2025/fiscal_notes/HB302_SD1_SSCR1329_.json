  "overview": "The measure has evolved significantly from a simple telehealth bill into a comprehensive cannabis regulation overhaul, as amended to incorporate the contents of S.B. No. 1064, S.D. 2. Key new components include the creation of a new cannabis cultivator license class to restructure the market supply chain and the establishment of Class C felony penalties for operating an unlicensed dispensary. The bill now also expands the definition of “debilitating medical condition,” empowering physicians to certify patients for any condition they deem appropriate.",
  "appropriations": "A new, though unspecified, appropriation is now included from the Medical Cannabis Registry and Regulation Special Fund to the Department of the Attorney General. This funding is designated for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027. The purpose of the appropriation is to support the enforcement of new prohibitions against unlicensed cannabis operations and to mitigate related public nuisances.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal analysis has shifted from negligible administrative costs to a significant financial impact driven by new regulatory and enforcement duties. Costs for the Department of the Attorney General's enforcement activities and the Department of Health's new cultivator licensing program are assumed to be covered by the Medical Cannabis Registry and Regulation Special Fund. This methodology presumes that new revenue from cultivator license fees will be sufficient to offset the increased expenditures.",
  "agency_impact": "The bill now creates a significant impact on the Department of the Attorney General, which is tasked with enforcing new criminal penalties against unlicensed cannabis operations, supported by a new appropriation. The Department of Health's responsibilities are also substantially expanded, as it must now develop, implement, and manage an entirely new licensing framework for cannabis cultivators. This includes rule-making, application processing, and ongoing compliance monitoring, representing a major increase in its regulatory workload.",
  "economic_impact": "The measure's economic focus has broadened from patient access to a fundamental restructuring of the state's cannabis market. The creation of a new cannabis cultivator license class aims to modify the supply chain, while new criminal penalties and enforcement actions against the illicit market are intended to shift consumer spending to the regulated medical system. Additionally, allowing dispensaries to sell hemp products in waiting rooms provides a new, minor revenue stream for licensed retailers.",
  "policy_impact": "The bill's policy scope has been dramatically widened, moving beyond telehealth to fundamentally reform the state's medical cannabis program. It introduces a new cannabis cultivator license, separating cultivation from dispensing and altering the market structure established in the original dispensary law. A major policy shift is the creation of a new enforcement regime targeting the illicit market, complete with criminal penalties and a mandate for the Attorney General to take action.",
  "revenue_sources": "The Medical Cannabis Registry and Regulation Special Fund remains the primary funding source but will now be supplemented by a new revenue stream from cannabis cultivator license fees. The bill explicitly authorizes expenditures from this fund for nuisance abatement programs and makes a direct appropriation to the Department of the Attorney General for enforcement purposes. This marks a significant expansion in the use and revenue sources for the special fund.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The six-year fiscal forecast has changed from negligible to significant, reflecting new, recurring costs for enforcement and regulation. The bill appropriates funds to the Department of the Attorney General for FY26 and FY27 to establish an enforcement program against unlicensed cannabis operations, with these costs expected to be ongoing. Simultaneously, the Department of Health will incur substantial and continuous costs to create and manage the new cultivator licensing program, including rule-making, application processing, and inspections. These new state functions will be funded by the Medical Cannabis Registry and Regulation Special Fund, which will be augmented by new cultivator license fee revenues. The net fiscal impact over the six-year period will depend on the scale of the new licensing program and the intensity of enforcement required.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The measure is now projected to directly increase state operating revenues through the creation of a new cannabis cultivator license. The Department of Health will collect application and renewal fees for this new license class, which will be deposited into the Medical Cannabis Registry and Regulation Special Fund. This introduces a new, ongoing revenue stream to support the expanded regulatory framework.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The long-term fiscal obligations are now substantial, creating permanent new regulatory and enforcement responsibilities for the state. The Department of Health will have ongoing costs to manage the cultivator license program, and the Department of the Attorney General will have a continuing mandate to enforce laws against unlicensed operators. These recurring annual costs will require a sustainable revenue stream from licensing fees into the Medical Cannabis Registry and Regulation Special Fund.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The bill has been fundamentally transformed by incorporating the provisions of S.B. No. 1064, S.D. 2, shifting its focus from telehealth to a major regulatory overhaul. The prior discussion about a temporary patient purchase provision is now obsolete, as that language was not adopted. Key changes include: the creation of a new 'cannabis cultivator' license class; the introduction of Class C felony penalties for unlicensed cannabis operations; a new appropriation to the Department of the Attorney General for enforcement; and a significant expansion of qualifying conditions for medical cannabis."
