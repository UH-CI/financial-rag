  "overview": "The purpose of this measure is to repeal the requirement that a provider-patient relationship be established in person (HB302_SD1_SSCR1329_). The legislature finds that registration for the medical cannabis program has decreased from a peak of 35,444 card-holding patients in August 2021 to 30,035 by November 2024 (HB302_SD1). The measure now also amends the definition of \"debilitating medical condition\", amends the definition of \"waiting room\", establishes a cannabis cultivator license, prohibits unlicensed operations, and appropriates funds for enforcement (HB302_SD1_SSCR1329_).",
  "appropriations": "There is appropriated out of the medical cannabis registry and regulation special fund the sum of $ or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2025-2026 and the same sum or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2026-2027 (HB302_SD1). The funds are for the department of the attorney general to enforce, and mitigate nuisances relating to, chapter 329D, Hawaii Revised Statutes (HB302_SD1). The sums appropriated shall be expended by the director of health for the purposes of this part (HB302_SD1).",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "",
  "agency_impact": "The Department of Health supports the measure, noting it is grateful for an amendment to limit medical cannabis certifications to those originating from within the state (HB302_HD2_TESTIMONY_HHS-CPN_03-19-25_). The Department is required to issue a cease and desist notice to violators before initiating criminal proceedings and to establish a cannabis cultivator license program (HB302_SD1). The Department of the Attorney General is appropriated funds to enforce chapter 329D, Hawaii Revised Statutes (HB302_SD1).",
  "economic_impact": "The number of registered medical cannabis patients reached its peak in August 2021, with 35,444 card-holding patients, but has since decreased over fifteen per cent to 30,035 by November 2024 (HB302_SD1). This shift away from licensed dispensaries is attributed to administrative barriers, delays in registering, and the ease and lower costs in obtaining cannabis elsewhere (HB302_SD1). The Department of Health noted that a removed provision for immediate purchases posed significant risks, as it would lead to inaccuracies in sales tracking and patient verification systems at state-licensed dispensaries (HB302_HD2_TESTIMONY_HHS-CPN_03-19-25_).",
  "policy_impact": "This measure now amends the definition of \"debilitating medical condition\" to any condition determined by the certifying physician or advanced practice registered nurse to be appropriate for the medical use of cannabis (HB302_SD1_SSCR1329_). It also amends the definition of \"waiting room\" to include an area where hemp can be sold (HB302_SD1_SSCR1329_). A new cannabis cultivator license is established, and any person who operates a dispensary without a license shall be guilty of a class C felony (HB302_SD1).",
  "revenue_sources": "The bill appropriates funds from the medical cannabis registry and regulation special fund for the Department of Attorney General to enforce, and mitigate nuisances relating to, chapter 329D, HRS (HB302_SD1). Expenditures from the Medical Cannabis Registry and Regulation Special Fund are now authorized to fund programs for the mitigation and abatement of nuisances relating to chapter 329D, Hawaii Revised Statutes (HB302_SD1_SSCR1329_).",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The bill appropriates an unspecified sum out of the medical cannabis registry and regulation special fund for fiscal year 2025-2026 and the same sum for fiscal year 2026-2027 (HB302_SD1). These funds are for the department of the attorney general to enforce, and mitigate nuisances relating to, chapter 329D, Hawaii Revised Statutes (HB302_SD1). The bill establishes a new cannabis cultivator license to authorize the cultivation and distribution of cannabis plants, with limits on the number of licenses and the maximum size of plant canopy (HB302_SD1_SSCR1329_). The Department of Health is required to issue not more than one cannabis cultivator license for each person (HB302_SD1_SSCR1329_). The bill also establishes new criminal penalties, including a class C felony for operating a dispensary without a license (HB302_SD1). The Medical Cannabis Registry and Regulation Special Fund is now authorized for expenditures to fund programs for the mitigation and abatement of nuisances (HB302_SD1_SSCR1329_). These new enforcement responsibilities and licensing programs represent new, ongoing administrative costs for the Department of Health and the Department of the Attorney General (HB302_SD1_SSCR1329_).",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The amended definition of \"waiting room\" now includes an area where hemp can be sold, including but not limited to hemp products and accessories to the use of medical cannabis (HB302_SD1_SSCR1329_). This change could create a new revenue stream for licensed medical cannabis dispensaries. The creation of a new cannabis cultivator license may also generate new licensing fee revenue for the state (HB302_SD1).",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The bill's scope has expanded significantly to include provisions from S.B. No. 1064, S.D. 2, which establishes new criminal penalties, a cannabis cultivator license, and enforcement mechanisms (HB302_SD1_SSCR1329_). The definition of \"debilitating medical condition\" has been amended to be any condition determined appropriate by a certifying provider, and the \"waiting room\" definition is amended to allow for the sale of hemp products (HB302_SD1). The bill now includes a specific legislative finding that patient registration has decreased over fifteen per cent from a 2021 peak of 35,444 to 30,035 by November 2024 (HB302_SD1). A new, though unspecified, appropriation from the medical cannabis registry and regulation special fund is established for the Department of the Attorney General for enforcement purposes for fiscal years 2026 and 2027 (HB302_SD1)."
