{
  "overview": "The scope of the measure has expanded significantly, now repealing the in-person consultation requirement for medical cannabis certification while also redefining \"debilitating medical condition\" to any condition deemed appropriate by a provider (HB302_SD1). It introduces new commercial activity by allowing the sale of hemp products in dispensary waiting rooms (HB302_SD1). A major addition is a new regulatory and enforcement framework that establishes a distinct cannabis cultivator license and imposes criminal penalties for unlicensed operations, supported by an appropriation to the Department of the Attorney General (HB302_SD1).",
  "appropriations": "The bill appropriates an unspecified sum ($ (HB302_SD1)) from the medical cannabis registry and regulation special fund for fiscal year 2025-2026 and the same sum for fiscal year 2026-2027 (HB302_SD1). These funds are allocated to the Department of the Attorney General for the enforcement of chapter 329D, Hawaii Revised Statutes, including the mitigation of nuisances related to unlicensed cannabis activities (HB302_SD1). The Director of Health is tasked with expending the appropriated sums for these purposes (HB302_SD1).",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal analysis is based on the statutory changes proposed in the bill, as a specific appropriation amount is not provided, and no workload or revenue projections are included (HB302_SD1). Costs for the Department of the Attorney General's new enforcement duties are indeterminate and will be driven by the volume of cease and desist notices and subsequent criminal cases pursued (HB302_SD1). Financial projections for the new cultivator license program cannot be made, as the bill does not specify the number of licenses to be issued or the associated fees (HB302_SD1).",
  "agency_impact": "The measure now significantly impacts multiple agencies; the Department of Health is tasked with creating and administering an entirely new cannabis cultivator licensing program (HB302_SD1). The Department of the Attorney General is assigned new enforcement responsibilities against unlicensed cannabis operations, supported by a direct appropriation from the medical cannabis registry and regulation special fund (HB302_SD1). Both agencies will be involved in a new enforcement process requiring the issuance of a cease and desist notice before the initiation of criminal proceedings against violators (HB302_SD1).",
  "economic_impact": "The bill introduces new potential revenue streams for licensed dispensaries by authorizing the sale of hemp products and accessories in their waiting rooms (HB302_SD1). It also proposes the creation of a new cannabis cultivator license, which could expand the legal cannabis market and create new businesses, although the number of available licenses is not specified (HB302_SD1). The addition of class C felony penalties and enhanced enforcement against unlicensed operators is intended to curb the illicit market, which may shift economic activity toward the regulated medical cannabis system (HB302_SD1).",
  "policy_impact": "This measure enacts a major policy shift by expanding the medical cannabis program's qualifying conditions to any condition a provider deems appropriate, effectively allowing off-label certification (HB302_SD1). It fundamentally alters the market structure by introducing a cannabis cultivator license, potentially moving away from the purely vertically integrated dispensary model (HB302_SD1). The bill also establishes a more aggressive policy against the illicit market by creating new criminal penalties for unlicensed operations and for platforms that advertise them (HB302_SD1).",
  "revenue_sources": "The bill authorizes new expenditures from the medical cannabis registry and regulation special fund to support enforcement actions by the Department of the Attorney General (HB302_SD1). An appropriation of an unspecified amount ($ (HB302_SD1)) for fiscal years 2025-2027 is made from this fund (HB302_SD1). The creation of a new cannabis cultivator license is expected to generate new state revenue through licensing fees, though the fee structure and revenue potential are not defined (HB302_SD1).",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The bill creates ongoing fiscal obligations by establishing a new cannabis cultivator licensing program administered by the Department of Health, which will require sustained resources for rulemaking, oversight, and compliance (HB302_SD1). It appropriates funds for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027 from the medical cannabis registry and regulation special fund for enforcement by the Department of the Attorney General (HB302_SD1). These enforcement functions are permanent and will likely require continued funding in future budget cycles to combat the illicit market. The new criminal penalties could also have long-term, indeterminate cost implications for the judiciary and public safety sectors. Broadening the definition of \"debilitating medical condition\" could increase patient registration, thereby increasing fee revenue into the special fund over the six-year period. Similarly, allowing hemp sales may increase dispensary gross income and associated tax revenues. However, long-term revenue projections from the new cultivator licenses are not possible as the number of licenses and fees are unspecified. The overall fiscal impact will be contingent on the scale of the new licensing program and the intensity of enforcement actions.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The bill is anticipated to increase state operating revenue through fees generated by the new cannabis cultivator license program, although the number of licenses and fee amounts are yet to be determined (HB302_SD1). By allowing dispensaries to sell hemp products and accessories, the measure could increase their gross receipts and result in a corresponding minor increase in state tax collections (HB302_SD1). An increase in the number of registered patients due to the expanded definition of \"debilitating medical condition\" would also boost fee revenue deposited into the medical cannabis registry and regulation special fund (HB302_SD1).",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The fiscal responsibilities established by this measure are ongoing and will extend beyond the six-year outlook, as the new cannabis cultivator licensing program and the enhanced enforcement framework are permanent statutory changes (HB302_SD1). Continued funding will be necessary for the Department of Health to administer the cultivator license system and for the Department of the Attorney General to sustain enforcement efforts against unlicensed cannabis operations (HB302_SD1). The long-term costs and revenues will be directly influenced by the future size and dynamics of Hawaii's legal and illicit cannabis markets (HB302_SD1).",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The bill has been substantially amended, evolving far beyond its original intent; it now broadens the definition of \"debilitating medical condition\" to any condition a provider finds appropriate, a significant policy that was previously only a stakeholder suggestion (HB302_SD1). New provisions have been added to permit the sale of hemp products in dispensary waiting rooms and to authorize inter-dispensary transfers for further manufacturing (HB302_SD1). The most significant change is the incorporation of language creating a new cannabis cultivator license and a robust enforcement framework with class C felony penalties for unlicensed operators, which is supported by an unspecified appropriation from the medical cannabis registry and regulation special fund to the Attorney General (HB302_SD1). The contentious issue of allowing immediate patient purchases after application remains unresolved, as it is absent from the current draft but continues to be requested in testimony (HB302_HD2_TESTIMONY_HHS-CPN_03-19-25_)."
