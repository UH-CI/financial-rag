  "overview": "This measure repeals the requirement for an in-person consultation to establish a provider-patient relationship for medical cannabis certification (HB302_HD2_HSCR1079_). While the Department of Health supports the current draft, multiple cannabis industry stakeholders testified in support of re-inserting a deleted provision that would grant new applicants immediate access to purchase cannabis (HB302_HD2_TESTIMONY_JHA_02-25-25_). A proposed amendment would allow a one-time purchase of no more than twenty-five percent of the dispensing limit while awaiting the physical registration card to reduce patient access delays (HB302_HD2_TESTIMONY_JHA_02-25-25_).",

  "agency_impact": "The Department of Health has reiterated its support for the measure in its current form, which has no direct operational impact on the department (HB302_HD2_TESTIMONY_JHA_02-25-25_). However, an amendment proposed by industry stakeholders to allow for temporary purchases would re-introduce an administrative function, requiring the department to facilitate temporary authorizations for new applicants (HB302_HD2_TESTIMONY_JHA_02-25-25_). Further testimony proposed using AI technology to make registration approval instantaneous, which would represent a significant change in the department's application processing workflow (HB302_HD2_TESTIMONY_JHA_02-25-25_).",
  "economic_impact": "Testimony from the cannabis industry indicates that the number of registered medical cannabis patients has declined by 15% over the past three years due to access barriers (HB302_HD2_TESTIMONY_JHA_02-25-25_). Industry proponents argue that allowing a temporary, one-time purchase for new applicants would help reverse this decline and prevent patients from seeking cannabis from the unregulated illicit market (HB302_HD2_TESTIMONY_JHA_02-25-25_). Without this provision, the economic impact of the bill is limited to the potential increase in patient certifications resulting from easier telehealth access.",
  "policy_impact": "The policy discussion now centers on a significant disagreement between the Department of Health and industry advocates regarding immediate patient access upon application submission (HB302_HD2_TESTIMONY_JHA_02-25-25_). While the current bill prioritizes regulatory safeguards by removing the temporary purchase provision, stakeholders are pushing to re-introduce it to prevent delays they claim push patients to the illicit market (HB302_HD2_TESTIMONY_JHA_02-25-25_). Additional policy amendments were also proposed in testimony, including allowing certifying providers to determine qualifying conditions, which would substantially alter the state's control over the medical cannabis program's scope (HB302_HD2_TESTIMONY_JHA_02-25-25_).",

  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "A major change in the discussion around this bill is the unified effort by cannabis dispensaries and industry associations to re-insert a provision allowing for a temporary one-time purchase for new applicants, proposing a specific limit of twenty-five percent of the dispensing amount (HB302_HD2_TESTIMONY_JHA_02-25-25_). This push is supported by new testimony stating that registered patient numbers have declined 15% in the last three years (HB302_HD2_TESTIMONY_JHA_02-25-25_). Despite this testimony, the latest committee report indicates the bill is advancing without this amendment (HB302_HD2_HSCR1079_). Additionally, new proposals not previously considered include allowing providers to determine qualifying conditions and using AI for instant registration (HB302_HD2_TESTIMONY_JHA_02-25-25_)."
