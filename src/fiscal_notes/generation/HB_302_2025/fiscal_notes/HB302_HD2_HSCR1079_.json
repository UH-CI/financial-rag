  "overview": "The purpose of this measure is to repeal the requirement that a provider-patient relationship be established in person for the purposes of certifying a qualifying patient for the medical use of cannabis (HB302_HD2_HSCR1079_). Your Committee finds that laws relating to telehealth were revised in 2021, which for all other medications except for opiates and medical cannabis, allows the issuance of prescriptions through telehealth consultations without the establishment of a bona fide provider-patient relationship in person (HB302_HD2_HSCR1079_). This differentiated treatment of medical cannabis from other medications appears arbitrary and this measure eliminates this barrier (HB302_HD2_HSCR1079_).",

  "agency_impact": "Testimony suggests further amendments for future consideration, including that the department shall use AI technology to make registration approval instantaneous (HB302_HD2_TESTIMONY_JHA_02-25-25_).",
  "economic_impact": "Testimony highlights that currently, a patient may wait anywhere from 3 days to a week to obtain their medical cannabis card or “329 card” (HB302_HD2_TESTIMONY_JHA_02-25-25_). This delay is often a significant barrier for patients who need their cannabis medication right away and can serve to push a patient towards obtaining product from the illicit market (HB302_HD2_TESTIMONY_JHA_02-25-25_).",
  "policy_impact": "Industry stakeholders propose amending the bill to re-insert language allowing for a temporary, one-time purchase of cannabis, suggesting a revision to lessen the amount from fifty percent (50%) to twenty-five percent (25%) of the dispensing limits (HB302_HD2_TESTIMONY_JHA_02-25-25_). Testimony also suggests further amendments for consideration, such as allowing certifying providers to decide qualifying conditions (HB302_HD2_TESTIMONY_JHA_02-25-25_).",

  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "While industry continues to request the re-insertion of language allowing for temporary medical cannabis purchases, new testimony proposes a specific compromise to allow a one-time purchase of no more than twenty-five per cent of the dispensing limits (HB302_HD2_TESTIMONY_JHA_02-25-25_). A new committee report further clarifies the bill's rationale, finding the current in-person requirement for medical cannabis to be arbitrary following 2021 revisions to telehealth laws for other medications (HB302_HD2_HSCR1079_). New testimony specifies that the patient registration delay can be anywhere from 3 days to a week (HB302_HD2_TESTIMONY_JHA_02-25-25_), and also introduces additional amendments for consideration, such as using AI for instantaneous registration approval (HB302_HD2_TESTIMONY_JHA_02-25-25_)."
