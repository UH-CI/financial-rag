  "overview": "The purpose of this measure is to repeal the requirement that a provider-patient relationship be established in person for the purposes of certifying a qualifying patient for the medical use of cannabis, with certain restrictions. [9] The Department of Health supports the measure's intent to reduce barriers to medical cannabis access. [8] However, multiple cannabis dispensaries and the Hawaiʻi Cannabis Industry Association request that language removed in a prior committee, which allowed for temporary purchases, be re-inserted to avoid patient access delays.

  "agency_impact": "The Department of Health appreciates the removal of the provision that would have allowed patients to purchase cannabis without first having their applications processed and receiving a registration card from the Department. [8] This provision posed risks, including exposing a subset of patients to arrest for possession of a controlled substance without a physical medical cannabis card and creating inaccuracies in sales tracking and patient verification systems. [8] Testimony proposed that the department should use AI technology to make registration approval instantaneous. [8]",
  "economic_impact": "Testimony states that the number of registered patients has declined 15% over the past 3 years. [8] A significant barrier for patients is the delay of anywhere from 3 days to a week to obtain their medical cannabis card or “329 card” after applying. [8] This delay can serve to push a patient towards obtaining product from the illicit market. [8]",
  "policy_impact": "While the current version of the bill removes a provision for immediate patient access, several industry stakeholders request re-inserting language to allow a one-time purchase of cannabis before a patient receives their confirmed registration. [8] A proposed amendment would limit this one-time purchase to an amount that is no more than twenty-five per cent of the dispensing limits. [8] Further testimony suggested other policy changes, such as allowing certifying providers to decide qualifying conditions. [8]",

  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "A primary update is the significant testimony from industry stakeholders requesting the re-insertion of a previously deleted provision that would allow a temporary, one-time purchase of cannabis for new applicants. [8] As a compromise, industry representatives proposed reducing the limit for this one-time purchase from fifty percent to twenty-five percent of the dispensing limit. [8] The Department of Health's testimony reinforces its support for the current draft, which omits this temporary purchase provision, citing risks to patients and data tracking. [8] Additional testimony introduced new policy suggestions, such as using AI for instantaneous registration approval and allowing providers to determine debilitating medical conditions. [8] [8] The latest committee report recommends that the bill pass without the industry-requested amendments. [9]"
