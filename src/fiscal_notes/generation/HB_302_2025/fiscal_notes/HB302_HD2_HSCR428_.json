  "overview": "This measure's scope has been further refined to focus solely on patient access by repealing the in-person provider consultation requirement for medical cannabis certifications. A new provision has been added requiring that all written certifications must originate from within the State of Hawaii. The provision that would have allowed applicants to make a one-time cannabis purchase while awaiting their registration card has been deleted from this version of the bill (HB302_HD2_HSCR428_).",

  "agency_impact": "The operational impact on the Department of Health (DOH) to facilitate temporary purchase authorizations has been removed, as that provision was deleted from the bill (HB302_HD2_HSCR428_). Following this amendment and the addition of a clause requiring certifications to originate within the state, the DOH has shifted its position to support the measure (HB302_HD2). The concerns previously raised by the DOH and the Department of the Attorney General regarding legal liability and regulatory issues have been addressed by the changes in this draft.",
  "economic_impact": "While the measure still aims to mitigate the decline in registered medical cannabis patients by easing access, its potential economic effect has been altered. The provision to allow temporary purchases, which was intended to immediately bring patients into the regulated dispensary system, has been removed (HB302_HD2_HSCR428_). The economic impact now relies solely on the telehealth provision to encourage program participation.",
  "policy_impact": "The measure's policy focus has shifted from the previous draft. The policy goal of providing immediate patient access through temporary purchases has been eliminated (HB302_HD2_HSCR428_). A new policy has been introduced to safeguard against out-of-state influence by requiring that all medical cannabis certifications originate from within the State, a change supported by the Department of Health (HB302_HD2).",

These amendments resolved the concerns of the Department of Health, which now supports the measure (HB302_HD2)."
