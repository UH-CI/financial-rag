  "overview": "The purpose of this measure is to repeal the requirement that a provider-patient relationship be established in person for purposes of obtaining a certification for medical cannabis (HB302_HD2_HSCR428_). Your Committee has amended this measure by deleting language that allowed applicants or primary caregivers to temporarily purchase medical cannabis after the submission of the applicant's certification form (HB302_HD2_HSCR428_). The measure now also specifies that written certifications must originate from within the State (HB302_HD2_HSCR428_).",

  "agency_impact": "The Department of Health supports the amended measure, appreciating the removal of the provision that would have allowed patients to purchase cannabis without first having their applications processed (HB302_HD2). The Department notes this provision posed risks, including exposing patients to arrest and creating inaccuracies in sales tracking and patient verification systems within state-licensed dispensaries (HB302_HD2). The Department is also grateful for the inclusion of the amendment to limit medical cannabis certifications to those originating from within the state, which serves to prevent mainland-based cannabis telehealth companies from operating in Hawaii (HB302_HD2).",
  "economic_impact": "Testimony indicates that the number of registered medical cannabis patients has declined 15% over the past 3 years, with one of the primary causes being regulatory barriers for patients (HB302_HD2). The high barriers to access include the uninsured and uncontrolled cost of a medical cannabis card, which can range from $100.00 (HB302_HD1_TESTIMONY_CPC_02-06-25_.PDF.txt) to $300.00 (HB302_HD1_TESTIMONY_CPC_02-06-25_.PDF.txt) omit the $38.50 (HB302_HD1_TESTIMONY_CPC_02-06-25_.PDF.txt) state fee (HB302_HD1_TESTIMONY_CPC_02-06-25_). This measure is intended to ease the difficulties on patients and primary caregivers by repealing the requirement that a provider-patient relationship be established in person (HB302_HD2).",
  "policy_impact": "This measure has been amended to delete the provision allowing applicants to purchase medical cannabis before receiving a confirmed registration, a change supported by the Department of Health and the Department of the Attorney General (HB302_HD2_HSCR428_). However, industry stakeholders request that the language be re-inserted to help avoid patient access delays (HB302_HD2). A new provision was added specifying that written certifications must originate from within the State to prevent mainland-based telehealth companies, which have faced scrutiny for questionable practices, from operating in Hawaii (HB302_HD2).",

  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The most significant change from the previous version of the bill is the deletion of language that would have allowed applicants or primary caregivers to temporarily purchase medical cannabis after submitting a certification form; this removal was supported by the Department of Health (HB302_HD2_HSCR428_). Concurrently, a new provision has been added specifying that written certifications for medical cannabis must originate from within the State, which serves as a safeguard against certain mainland-based telehealth companies (HB302_HD2). Industry testimony now requests the re-insertion of the deleted temporary purchase provision to avoid patient access delays (HB302_HD2)."
