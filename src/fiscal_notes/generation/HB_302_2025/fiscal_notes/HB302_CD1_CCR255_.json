{
  "overview": "This measure now authorizes the Department of Health to inspect the medical records of qualifying patients held by their certifying provider and amends definitions such as 'qualifying patient' to potentially expand access (HB302_CD1). The implementation of the new cannabis cultivator license requirement has been postponed by one year to January 1, 2028 (HB302_CD1). Additionally, the bill establishes criminal penalties for the unlicensed operation of a medical cannabis dispensary effective July 1, 2025 (HB302_CD1_CCR255_).",
  "appropriations": "A specific appropriation from the medical cannabis registry and regulation special fund has been inserted into the bill (HB302_CD1_CCR255_). The bill allocates $750,000 (HB302_CD1) for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $750,000 (HB302_CD1) for fiscal year 2026-2027 to the Department of the Attorney General. These funds are designated to establish and staff a drug nuisance abatement unit with six full-time equivalent positions: four investigator V, one investigator IV, and one analyst (HB302_CD1).",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "Fiscal projections are now based on a specific, known cost for enforcement for the first two fiscal years, with an appropriation of $750,000 (HB302_CD1) per year for staff and operations. The timeline for estimating costs and revenues associated with the new cannabis cultivator license program is pushed back, as the program's start date is now January 1, 2028 (HB302_CD1). All other methodologies for projecting indeterminate judicial and enforcement costs remain consistent.",
  "agency_impact": "The impact on the Department of the Attorney General is now quantified, with the addition of six full-time equivalent positions (4.0 investigator V, 1.0 investigator IV, 1.0 analyst) funded by a biennial appropriation of $1,500,000 (HB302_CD1). The Department of Health will now be responsible for a new regulatory function of inspecting patient medical records held by providers (HB302_CD1). The operational impact on the Department of Health from establishing the cultivator license program is delayed further, with implementation now scheduled for January 1, 2028 (HB302_CD1).",
  "economic_impact": "The measure now includes a direct economic infusion into public safety, appropriating a total of $1,500,000 (HB302_CD1) over two fiscal years for enforcement positions within the Department of the Attorney General. The potential economic effects from the new cannabis cultivator licenses are postponed, as the program is now set to begin on January 1, 2028 (HB302_CD1). The new enforcement measures may further shift economic activity from the illicit market to the regulated medical cannabis industry.",
  "policy_impact": "The bill's policy framework is updated by delaying the new cannabis cultivator licensing requirement by one year to January 1, 2028 (HB302_CD1). A significant policy addition grants the Department of Health new regulatory authority to inspect patient medical records to ensure compliance (HB302_CD1). Furthermore, the measure amends the definitions of 'qualifying patient' and 'written certification', which could alter the criteria for patient participation in the medical cannabis program (HB302_CD1).",
  "revenue_sources": "The bill now specifies the exact amount to be expended from the medical cannabis registry and regulation special fund for enforcement purposes. The Department of the Attorney General is appropriated $750,000 (HB302_CD1) in fiscal year 2025-2026 and $750,000 (HB302_CD1) in fiscal year 2026-2027 from this fund. The timeline for any potential new state revenue from cannabis cultivator license fees is delayed until after the program's new start date of January 1, 2028 (HB302_CD1).",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The bill's six-year fiscal outlook now includes specific, known costs for the first two years, with appropriations of $750,000 (HB302_CD1) in FY 2025-2026 and $750,000 (HB302_CD1) in FY 2026-2027 to the Department of the Attorney General. These funds will support six new full-time positions for nuisance abatement and enforcement related to illegal cannabis (HB302_CD1). These costs are expected to be recurring in subsequent years. The fiscal impact of the new cannabis cultivator license program has been pushed beyond the six-year window, as its implementation date is now January 1, 2028 (HB302_CD1). Therefore, no revenues or administrative costs for the Department of Health related to that program are anticipated within this timeframe.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The potential for increased state operating revenue from the new cannabis cultivator license program is now deferred until after January 1, 2028 (HB302_CD1). This change means no new revenue from this source is anticipated within the upcoming six-year fiscal period. There are no other anticipated changes to operating revenue.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The ongoing fiscal obligations after six years will include the recurring annual costs for the six enforcement positions in the Attorney General's office, initially funded at $750,000 (HB302_CD1) per year. Additionally, the full fiscal impact of the cannabis cultivator license program, including administrative costs for the Department of Health and revenue from license fees, will begin to be realized in this period due to its January 1, 2028 (HB302_CD1), start date. Sustained funding from the medical cannabis registry and regulation special fund or other sources will be necessary for both initiatives.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The most significant update is the insertion of a specific appropriation of $750,000 (HB302_CD1) for FY 2025-2026 and $750,000 (HB302_CD1) for FY 2026-2027 to fund six new enforcement positions in the Attorney General's office. The implementation of the new cannabis cultivator license program has been postponed by one year to January 1, 2028 (HB302_CD1), shifting its fiscal impact outside of the standard six-year planning window. New provisions also grant the Department of Health authority to inspect patient medical records and amend key definitions for program eligibility (HB302_CD1)."
