  "overview": "This measure authorizes the Department of Health (DOH) to inspect qualifying patient medical records and amends definitions related to the medical use of cannabis, including \"qualifying patient\" and \"written certification\". It clarifies conditions for medical cannabis use, authorizes establishing a provider-patient relationship via telehealth for written certifications, and allows the sale of hemp products and accessories at retail dispensing locations. Additionally, the measure establishes criminal penalties for unlicensed dispensaries, authorizes expenditures for nuisance abatement, and creates a cannabis cultivator license to be issued by DOH.",
  "appropriations": "The legislative document specifies there is appropriated out of the medical cannabis registry and regulation special fund the sum of $750,000 (HB302_CD1_.HTM.txt) or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2025-2026 and the same sum or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2026-2027 for the department of the attorney general. These funds are to enforce, and mitigate nuisances relating to, illegal cannabis and hemp products and chapter 329D, Hawaii Revised Statutes. The appropriation is intended to establish, recruit, and hire four full-time equivalent (4.0 FTE) investigator V positions, one full-time equivalent (1.0 FTE) investigator IV position, and one full-time equivalent (1.0 FTE) analyst position.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "",
  "agency_impact": "The measure authorizes the Department of Health to inspect a qualifying patient's medical records and to suspend or revoke the ability to issue a written certification for non-compliance. The department of the attorney general is tasked with enforcing nuisance abatement related to illegal cannabis and hemp products, supported by a new appropriation and six new positions. Beginning January 1, 2028, the Department of Health will be responsible for issuing and regulating a new cannabis cultivator license.",
  "economic_impact": "The legislature finds that registration for the medical cannabis program has decreased over fifteen per cent from a peak of 35,444 card-holding patients in August 2021 to 30,035 by November 2024, indicating a shift away from licensed dispensaries. This measure authorizes the sale of hemp products and accessories at retail dispensing locations, potentially creating a new revenue stream for licensed dispensaries. The bill also limits the maximum fee a provider may assess for issuing a written certification, which may reduce costs for patients seeking access to the program.",
  "policy_impact": "This measure amends chapter 329, Hawaii Revised Statutes, by authorizing DOH to inspect patient medical records and adding a definition for \"primary treating medical provider\". It establishes criminal penalties for the unlicensed operation of a medical cannabis dispensary beginning July 1, 2025, and prohibits cannabis cultivation without a license beginning January 1, 2028. The measure also expands the use of the medical cannabis registry and regulation special fund to include programs for the mitigation and abatement of nuisances relating to illegal cannabis and hemp products.",
  "revenue_sources": "Funding is appropriated out of the medical cannabis registry and regulation special fund (HB302_CD1_.HTM.txt). This special fund is established under section 321-30.1, Hawaii Revised Statutes, and is expended at the discretion of the director of health. The measure amends this section to authorize expenditures from the fund for programs related to the mitigation and abatement of nuisances from illegal cannabis and hemp products.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The measure appropriates $750,000 (HB302_CD1_.HTM.txt) from the medical cannabis registry and regulation special fund for fiscal year 2025-2026 and an identical amount for fiscal year 2026-2027. These funds will support the department of the attorney general's enforcement and nuisance abatement activities. The appropriation is intended to establish six permanent, full-time equivalent positions: four investigator V, one investigator IV, and one analyst. These positions and their associated costs are expected to be recurring beyond the initial two-year appropriation period. Part II, which establishes criminal penalties for unlicensed operations, takes effect on July 1, 2025, potentially incurring costs for enforcement and adjudication within the six-year window. Part IV of the Act, which requires a cannabis cultivator license issued by the Department of Health, will take effect on January 1, 2028. This will likely require additional resources for the Department of Health to implement and manage the new licensing program in the later years of the fiscal outlook. The fiscal impact of regulating this new license type is not specified in the appropriation. Ongoing costs for the attorney general's unit will continue throughout the six-year period.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The ongoing fiscal obligations will include the recurring personnel and operating costs for the six positions established in the department of the attorney general's drug nuisance abatement unit. The cannabis cultivator license program, which begins on January 1, 2028, will create ongoing regulatory, oversight, and enforcement costs for the Department of Health. The sustainability of these programs will depend on the continued availability of funds from the medical cannabis registry and regulation special fund.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "A specific appropriation amount has been inserted, providing $750,000 (HB302_CD1_.HTM.txt) from the Medical Cannabis Registry and Regulation Special Fund for FY 2025-2026 and the same sum for FY 2026-2027 to the Attorney General to establish six specified positions for nuisance abatement. The scope of nuisance abatement has been expanded to explicitly include nuisances related to illegal cannabis and hemp products, not just medical cannabis dispensaries. The effective date for establishing criminal penalties for unlicensed dispensaries has been moved up to July 1, 2025, from January 1, 2027, while the effective date to prohibit cannabis cultivation without a license has been delayed to January 1, 2028, from January 1, 2027. The bill now newly authorizes the Department of Health to inspect qualifying patient medical records and amends statutory definitions for \"qualifying patient\" and \"written certification\"."
