  "overview": "This measure amends Hawaii's medical cannabis laws to support the regulated dispensary system and address competition from the illicit market. Key provisions include establishing a new cannabis cultivator license, permitting inter-dispensary sales of cannabis products, and repealing the requirement for in-person provider-patient consultations. The bill also establishes new criminal penalties for unlicensed cannabis operations and appropriates funds for enforcement.",
  "appropriations": "The measure appropriates an unspecified amount from the Medical Cannabis Registry and Regulation Special Fund to the Department of the Attorney General. These funds are designated for the enforcement of medical cannabis laws and the mitigation of related nuisances as described in chapter 329D, HRS. The appropriation will specifically support the activities of the Attorney General's Drug Nuisance Abatement Unit.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "This fiscal note is based on the qualitative information within the legislative committee report, as no quantitative financial projections or cost analyses were provided. The fiscal impact is inferred from the bill's programmatic requirements, such as the creation of a new licensing category and an expanded enforcement mandate. The costs are assumed to be covered by the specified special fund, but without specific appropriation amounts or fee schedules, a detailed cost-benefit analysis is not possible.",
  "agency_impact": "The Department of Health will experience an increased administrative workload related to establishing and managing the new cannabis cultivator licensing program and overseeing inter-dispensary transactions. The Department of the Attorney General will see an expansion of its enforcement responsibilities, specifically within its Drug Nuisance Abatement Unit, which will receive funding to investigate and prosecute unlicensed cannabis operations. Both agencies will require resources to fulfill these new regulatory and enforcement mandates.",
  "economic_impact": "The measure is expected to strengthen the economic viability of licensed medical cannabis dispensaries by reducing regulatory barriers and allowing for more efficient supply chain management through inter-dispensary sales. Enhanced enforcement against unlicensed operators aims to redirect consumer spending from the illicit market to the legal, regulated system. This shift could increase revenue for licensed businesses and subsequently for the state, while also ensuring product safety standards are met.",
  "policy_impact": "This measure significantly modifies state policy by moving away from a strict vertically integrated medical cannabis model to a more flexible system that includes separate cultivator licenses. It strengthens the state's enforcement powers by creating new criminal misdemeanors for unlicensed cannabis activities, including advertising on web platforms. Furthermore, the repeal of the in-person requirement for provider-patient relationships modernizes patient access to medical cannabis through telehealth.",
  "revenue_sources": "The primary funding source identified in the measure is the Medical Cannabis Registry and Regulation Special Fund. This existing fund will finance the appropriation for the Department of the Attorney General's enforcement activities. It is also anticipated that this special fund will see an increase in revenue from the collection of fees associated with the new cannabis cultivator licenses established by the bill.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The six-year fiscal outlook anticipates initial startup costs followed by recurring annual expenditures for the Departments of Health (DOH) and Attorney General (AG). In the first two years, the AG will utilize its appropriation to ramp up enforcement, while the DOH will incur costs developing rules for the new cultivator license and inter-dispensary sales. Beginning in the third year, with the license program effective January 1, 2027, the DOH's regulatory costs will become ongoing, offset by new fee revenue from cultivator licenses deposited into the Medical Cannabis Registry and Regulation Special Fund. For the remainder of the six-year period, these expenditures for enforcement and licensing are expected to stabilize into permanent operational costs. The net fiscal impact on the special fund will depend on the balance between the unspecified appropriation and new license fee revenues. The measure does not specify the number of new positions required, but staffing increases at both the DOH and AG are likely. The long-term sustainability hinges on whether the special fund's revenues are sufficient to cover these expanded, permanent programmatic responsibilities.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The measure is projected to increase operating revenue for the state, specifically for the Medical Cannabis Registry and Regulation Special Fund. This revenue increase will be generated primarily through fees collected from the new cannabis cultivator licenses. A secondary, indirect revenue increase may occur if enhanced enforcement successfully shifts commerce from the untaxed illicit market to the regulated legal market.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The legislative documents provided do not indicate a need for significant capital expenditures to implement this measure. The costs described are operational in nature, relating to staffing, administration of a licensing program, and enforcement activities. No major investments in new facilities, construction, or large-scale technology infrastructure are anticipated as a direct result of this bill.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "Beyond the initial six-year period, the fiscal implications of this measure will consist of ongoing, recurring annual operating costs. These permanent expenditures will be required to fund the Department of Health's continued administration of the cultivator licensing program and the Department of the Attorney General's sustained enforcement efforts. The long-term viability of these functions will depend on the sufficiency of revenue flowing into the Medical Cannabis Registry and Regulation Special Fund.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "No previous fiscal note was provided for comparison. This fiscal note has been generated based solely on the information contained in the provided committee report for H.B. No. 302, H.D. 2, S.D. 2."
