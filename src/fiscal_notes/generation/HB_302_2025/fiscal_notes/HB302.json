  "overview": "The purpose of this Act is to expand access to care by easing some of the burdens upon qualifying patients and primary caregivers. [1] This Act repeals the requirement that a provider-patient relationship be established in person and allows applicants or primary caregivers to temporarily purchase medical cannabis after the submission of the applicant's certification form. [1] The legislature finds that access for qualifying patients and primary caregivers to medical cannabis and particularly licensed medical cannabis dispensaries remains challenging due to limited access to medical providers and delays in obtaining allowed access. [1]",
  "appropriations": "The provided legislative documents do not contain any information regarding appropriations. [1]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The provided legislative documents do not contain any assumptions or methodology for fiscal projections. [1]",
  "agency_impact": "The department of health office of medical cannabis control and regulation shall facilitate the temporary authorization for applicants and primary caregivers. [1] The department of health shall require, in rules adopted pursuant to chapter 91, that all written certifications comply with a designated form completed by or on behalf of a qualifying patient. [1] After the submission of the applicant's form but before receipt of confirmed registration, the applicant may use the submission as proof for a one-time purchase from a licensed dispensary. [1]",
  "economic_impact": "The legislature finds that registration for the medical cannabis program has decreased from a peak of 35,444 card-holding patients in August 2021 to 30,035 by November 2024. [1] [1] This appears to indicate that residents are shifting away from licensed medical cannabis dispensaries, and instead are obtaining their medical cannabis from elsewhere due to difficulties, delays in registering, and the ease and lower costs in obtaining cannabis elsewhere. [1] [1] This apparent shift away from licensed medical cannabis dispensaries toward the illicit market, undermines the purposes of the medical cannabis program in ensuring patient safety, product safety, and public safety. [1]",
  "policy_impact": "This Act amends Section 329-123 and Section 329-126, Hawaii Revised Statutes. [1] [1] It repeals the requirement that a bona fide physician-patient relationship or bona fide advanced practice registered nurse-patient relationship be established by conducting an initial in-person consultation. [1] The Act also allows an applicant or primary caregiver to make a one-time purchase of cannabis in an amount that is no more than fifty per cent of the dispensing limits while awaiting their registration card from the department.
