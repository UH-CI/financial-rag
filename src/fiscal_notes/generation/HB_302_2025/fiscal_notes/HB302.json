  "overview": "This measure amends the state's medical cannabis laws by updating definitions, repealing the in-person requirement for the provider-patient relationship, and allowing dispensaries to purchase cannabis products from one another. It also establishes a new cannabis cultivator license and creates criminal penalties for unlicensed cannabis operations to combat the unregulated market. The bill appropriates funds to the Department of the Attorney General for enforcement purposes related to nuisance abatement.",
  "appropriations": "The measure appropriates an unspecified amount of funds out of the Medical Cannabis Registry and Regulation Special Fund (HB302). These funds are designated for the Department of Attorney General to enforce, and mitigate nuisances relating to, chapter 329D, HRS (HB302). The bill specifies that this appropriation shall be expended by the Attorney General (HB302).",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The provided document does not contain information regarding the assumptions, cost estimation methods, or data sources used for any financial projections. No methodology is described for calculating the costs associated with the new enforcement duties for the Department of the Attorney General or the licensing responsibilities for the Department of Health. The fiscal impact is based on an unquantified authorization of expenditures from an existing special fund.",
  "agency_impact": "The Department of Health is required to issue cease and desist notices to unlicensed operators and will manage the creation and issuance of a new cannabis cultivator license (HB302). The Department of the Attorney General's Drug Nuisance Abatement Unit is authorized to enforce nuisances related to chapter 329D, HRS (HB302). This new enforcement authority will be supported by an appropriation from the Medical Cannabis Registry and Regulation Special Fund (HB302).",
  "economic_impact": "This measure is intended to support the state's legal medical dispensary program, which faces competition from the unregulated market (HB302). By allowing inter-dispensary sales and creating penalties for unlicensed operations, the bill may increase the viability of licensed businesses. Lowering barriers for patients to enter the legal system could also expand the regulated customer base, potentially strengthening the local cannabis industry.",
  "policy_impact": "This bill significantly amends chapter 329D, HRS, by creating a new cannabis cultivator license and repealing the requirement that a provider-patient relationship be established in person (HB302). It establishes new criminal misdemeanor offenses for intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly operating an unlicensed dispensary or for platforms that advertise such sales (HB302). These changes reflect a policy shift to bolster the regulated medical cannabis system while actively penalizing the illicit market.",
  "revenue_sources": "The sole funding source identified in the measure is the Medical Cannabis Registry and Regulation Special Fund (HB302). This fund will support the appropriation for the Department of the Attorney General to enforce and mitigate nuisances related to chapter 329D, HRS (HB302). The document does not mention any other general funds, grants, or fees to support these activities.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The provided document does not offer a six-year fiscal projection. It appropriates an unspecified sum from the Medical Cannabis Registry and Regulation Special Fund for enforcement by the Department of the Attorney General, but provides no estimate of annual costs (HB302). The fiscal impact on the Department of Health for administering the new cannabis cultivator license program, which becomes effective January 1, 2027 (HB302), is also not detailed. There is no information regarding projected staffing changes, recurring expenses for compliance and enforcement, or the potential financial needs for legal proceedings against unlicensed operators. Without specific cost estimates or revenue projections associated with the new regulations and penalties, a multi-year fiscal outlook cannot be determined from the text.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The measure authorizes new expenditures from the Medical Cannabis Registry and Regulation Special Fund, which will result in a decrease to the fund's balance (HB302). The provided document does not introduce any new fees, fines, or other revenue streams that would increase operating revenue for the state or the special fund. The primary impact on operating revenue is negative due to the new spending authorization without corresponding income.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The legislative document provided does not mention any anticipated capital expenditures. There is no information suggesting a need for investments in new facilities, major equipment, or technology infrastructure to implement the bill's provisions. The changes are primarily regulatory and enforcement-oriented, with no specified capital costs.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The document does not detail the fiscal obligations after a six-year period. Ongoing costs will likely include recurring expenses for the Department of the Attorney General's enforcement activities and the Department of Health's administration of the cultivator licensing program. The long-term sustainability of these functions will depend on the revenue and balance of the Medical Cannabis Registry and Regulation Special Fund, for which no projections are provided.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "No previous fiscal note was provided in the context documents. Therefore, a comparison cannot be made, and there are no updates to report."
