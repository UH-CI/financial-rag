  "overview": "Your Committees find that the State's medical dispensary program is suffering from regulatory barriers that make operations difficult to sustain while facing increasing threats of competition from the unregulated market, including street sales and the proliferation of unregulated, high-potency THC cannabis, sold under the guise of being hemp, currently available at retailers across the State (HB302_SD2). This measure will lower the barrier to entry for patients to access the legal dispensary system while maintaining quality standards for licensees to ensure access to clean and tested cannabis (HB302_SD2). This amended version of the bill clarifies the state of mind for criminal offenses, specifies penalties, and changes the expending agency for an appropriation to the Attorney General (HB302_SD2).",
  "appropriations": "The appropriation for the Department of the Attorney General to enforce, and mitigate nuisances relating to, chapter 329D, HRS, shall be expended by the Attorney General (HB302_SD2).",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "",
  "agency_impact": "The Department of the Attorney General requested that the expending agency for the appropriation be changed from the Department of Health to the Department of the Attorney General for more streamlined expenditure of funds for drug nuisance abatement (HB302_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM-JDC_04-01-25_). The measure now inserts language specifying that the Department of the Attorney General's Drug Nuisance Abatement Unit may enforce nuisances relating to chapter 329D, HRS (HB302_SD2). The Department of Health notes that the measure does not provide funding to support the implementation and regulation of the new cannabis cultivator license type, which will include drafting new regulations and procuring new software for licensing and tracking cultivated cannabis (HB302_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM-JDC_04-01-25_).",
  "economic_impact": "Your Committees find that the State's medical dispensary program is suffering from regulatory barriers that make operations difficult to sustain while facing increasing threats of competition from the unregulated market, including street sales and the proliferation of unregulated, high-potency THC cannabis, sold under the guise of being hemp (HB302_SD2). One dispensary noted that to ensure access for vulnerable patients, its RSO is available at the everyday low price of $20.00 (HB302_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM-JDC_04-01-25_.PDF.txt) per gram. The Department of Health is concerned that an oversupply of cannabis without a corresponding increase in patient demand could leave newly licensed cultivators without a market, potentially leading to diversion into unregulated channels (HB302_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM-JDC_04-01-25_).",
  "policy_impact": "This measure has been amended by clarifying that the state of mind requirement for the offense of operating a dispensary without a license is intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly (HB302_SD2). It also specifies that a person who operates any search platform, web hosting service, or social media platform that advertises the sale of cannabis products by an unlicensed person is guilty of a misdemeanor (HB302_SD2). The bill inserts an effective date of January 1, 2027, for the requirement of cannabis cultivator licenses (HB302_SD2).",
  "revenue_sources": "",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The requirement for cannabis cultivator licenses has a delayed effective date of January 1, 2027 (HB302_SD2), which will delay the fiscal impact of implementing the new program. The Department of Health has stated that creating this new type of medical cannabis producer would require the DOH to use additional resources for oversight and enforcement and noted the measure does not provide funding to support this implementation (HB302_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM-JDC_04-01-25_). Implementation costs will include drafting new regulations and procuring new software for licensing and tracking cultivated cannabis (HB302_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM-JDC_04-01-25_). The appropriation for enforcement activities will now be expended by the Attorney General rather than the director of health (HB302_SD2). Language has been inserted to specify that the Department of the Attorney General's Drug Nuisance Abatement Unit may enforce nuisances relating to chapter 329D, HRS (HB302_SD2). The measure also creates a new misdemeanor offense for any search platform, web hosting service, or social media platform advertising the sale of cannabis by an unlicensed person, which may have minor fiscal implications related to enforcement and adjudication (HB302_SD2).",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The Department of Health has stated that the implementation and regulation of the new cannabis cultivator license type will require procuring new software for licensing and tracking cultivated cannabis (HB302_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM-JDC_04-01-25_). The measure does not provide funding to support this procurement (HB302_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM-JDC_04-01-25_).",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The expending agency for the appropriation to enforce and mitigate nuisances has been changed from the director of health to the Attorney General (HB302_SD2). The bill now clarifies the state of mind for the class C felony for unlicensed dispensary operation and establishes a new misdemeanor offense for platforms that advertise unlicensed cannabis sales (HB302_SD2). A delayed effective date of January 1, 2027, has been inserted for the requirement of cannabis cultivator licenses, and cultivators are now required to meet all production facility and processing requirements under chapter 329D, HRS (HB302_SD2). Finally, the measure now specifies that the Department of the Attorney General's Drug Nuisance Abatement Unit is authorized to enforce nuisances related to chapter 329D, HRS (HB302_SD2)."
