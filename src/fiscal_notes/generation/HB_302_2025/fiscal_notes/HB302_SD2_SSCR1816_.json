{
  "overview": "The measure's enforcement framework has been refined by clarifying the required state of mind for the offense of unlicensed dispensary operation is intentional, knowing, or reckless (HB302_SD2_SSCR1816_). It now specifies that operating a platform that advertises unlicensed cannabis sales is a misdemeanor (HB302_SD2_SSCR1816_). A significant change is the delayed implementation of the new cannabis cultivator license requirement, which now has an effective date of January 1, 2027 (HB302_SD2_SSCR1816_).",
  "appropriations": "The administration of the appropriated funds has been changed, as requested in testimony from the Department of the Attorney General (HB302_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM-JDC_04-01-25_). The bill now specifies that the appropriation from the Medical Cannabis Registry and Regulation Special Fund for nuisance enforcement shall be expended by the Attorney General, rather than the Director of Health (HB302_SD2_SSCR1816_). The appropriation amount remains unspecified.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "Fiscal projections are altered by the new implementation timeline, with the establishment of cannabis cultivator licenses now delayed until January 1, 2027 (HB302_SD2_SSCR1816_). This pushes any associated costs and revenues for the Department of Health's new licensing program to fiscal year 2027 and beyond. The clarification of criminal penalties to include a specific misdemeanor for advertising illegal sales provides a more defined, though still indeterminate, basis for estimating future judicial and enforcement costs (HB302_SD2_SSCR1816_).",
  "agency_impact": "The operational impact on the Department of the Attorney General is now more specific, as the bill inserts language clarifying that its Drug Nuisance Abatement Unit may enforce nuisances related to chapter 329D, HRS (HB302_SD2_SSCR1816_). Furthermore, the Attorney General is now designated as the direct expending authority for the appropriated enforcement funds (HB302_SD2_SSCR1816_). The impact on the Department of Health related to the cultivator license program is delayed until the new effective date of January 1, 2027 (HB302_SD2_SSCR1816_).",
  "economic_impact": "The potential economic impact from the creation of new cannabis cultivator licenses is now postponed, as the program will not be implemented until January 1, 2027 (HB302_SD2_SSCR1816_). The measure now targets the illicit online market more directly by establishing a misdemeanor offense for platforms that advertise unlicensed cannabis sales, which may curb illegal online commerce (HB302_SD2_SSCR1816_). This may further encourage economic activity to shift towards the regulated market.",
  "policy_impact": "The bill's policy rollout has been significantly adjusted by setting a delayed effective date of January 1, 2027, for the new cannabis cultivator licenses (HB302_SD2_SSCR1816_). The criminal enforcement policy is more nuanced, now distinguishing the state of mind for unlicensed dispensary operation and creating a separate misdemeanor offense for advertising illicit sales (HB302_SD2_SSCR1816_). Additionally, the measure specifies that cultivator licensees must adhere to all existing production facility and processing requirements under chapter 329D, HRS, ensuring policy consistency with the current dispensary framework (HB302_SD2_SSCR1816_).",
  "revenue_sources": "The bill clarifies that the Attorney General will be the expending authority for the appropriation from the Medical Cannabis Registry and Regulation Special Fund, not the Director of Health (HB302_SD2_SSCR1816_). Any new state revenue generated from the creation of cannabis cultivator licenses is now delayed until after the program's effective date of January 1, 2027 (HB302_SD2_SSCR1816_).",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The bill's six-year fiscal impact is significantly altered by the delayed effective date of January 1, 2027, for the cannabis cultivator license program (HB302_SD2_SSCR1816_). Consequently, any state costs for the Department of Health to establish the program and any revenue from licensing fees will not begin until the latter part of the six-year window, primarily impacting fiscal year 2027 and onward. The measure now provides more clarity on the use of the unspecified appropriation from the Medical Cannabis Registry and Regulation Special Fund by designating the Attorney General as the expending authority and specifying that the Drug Nuisance Abatement Unit may conduct enforcement (HB302_SD2_SSCR1816_). The distinction between felony and misdemeanor offenses for different types of unlicensed activity provides a clearer, though still indeterminate, basis for forecasting long-term costs to the judiciary.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The anticipated increase in state operating revenue from the new cannabis cultivator license program is now deferred. No revenue from these new license fees is expected until after the program's implementation date of January 1, 2027 (HB302_SD2_SSCR1816_). Other potential revenue impacts remain unchanged from the previous version.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The fiscal implications after six years are now more pronounced, as the full financial impact of the new cannabis cultivator licensing program will be realized in this period due to its January 1, 2027, effective date (HB302_SD2_SSCR1816_). The Department of Health will have ongoing administrative and oversight costs for the program, which will require sustained funding. Similarly, revenue generated from cultivator licensing fees will become a recurring component of the state's budget beyond the initial six-year outlook.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "Key changes from the previous version of the bill include the clarification of criminal penalties, specifying a misdemeanor for platforms advertising unlicensed sales and defining the 'intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly' state of mind for operating an unlicensed dispensary (HB302_SD2_SSCR1816_). The authority to expend the appropriated enforcement funds has been transferred from the Director of Health to the Attorney General, and the Attorney General's Drug Nuisance Abatement Unit has been specified as an enforcer (HB302_SD2_SSCR1816_). Most significantly, the implementation of the new cannabis cultivator license program has been delayed until January 1, 2027, shifting its fiscal impact to later years (HB302_SD2_SSCR1816_)."
