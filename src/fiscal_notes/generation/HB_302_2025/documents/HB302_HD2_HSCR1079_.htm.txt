RE:
H.B. No. 302
H.D.
2
Honorable Nadine K. Nakamura
Speaker, House of Representatives
Thirty-Third State Legislature
Regular Session of 2025
State of Hawaii
Madame:
Your Committee on Judiciary
& Hawaiian Affairs, to which was referred H.B. No. 302, H.D. 2, entitled:
"A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO CANNABIS,"
begs leave to report as follows:
The
purpose of this measure is to repeal the requirement that a provider-patient
relationship be established in person for the purposes of certifying a
qualifying patient for the medical use of cannabis, with certain restrictions.
Your Committee received testimony in support of this measure
from the Department of Health; Aloha Green Apothecary; Cure Oahu; Hawai
â€˜
i
Cannabis Industry Association; and Big Island Grown.
Your Committee received comments on this
measure from Akamai Cannabis Consulting.
Your Committee finds that the existing medical cannabis laws
prohibit the issuance of a written certification for the use of medical
cannabis by means of telehealth unless a bona fide provider-patient
relationship has been previously established in person.
Your Committee further finds that the laws
relating to telehealth were revised in 2021, which for all other medications
except for opiates and medical cannabis, allows the issuance of prescriptions
through telehealth consultations without the establishment of a bona fide
provider-patient relationship in person.
This differentiated treatment of medical cannabis from other medications
appears arbitrary and this measure eliminates this barrier, providing greater
access to necessary medication for patients.
As affirmed by the
record of votes of the members of your Committee on Judiciary & Hawaiian
Affairs that is attached to this report, your Committee is in accord with the
intent and purpose of H.B. No. 302, H.D. 2, and recommends that it pass Third
Reading.
Respectfully
submitted on behalf of the members of the Committee on Judiciary & Hawaiian
Affairs,
