Testimony in SUPPORT of  HB302 HD2 
RELATING TO CANNABIS 
REP. DAVID A. TARNAS, CHAIR

Hearing Date:  February 25, 2025

Department Position: The Department of Health (“Department”) supports this measure.

2 
Department Testimony:  The Department appreciates the intent of HB302 HD2 to reduce 
3 
barriers to medical cannabis access. The Department is grateful for the inclusion of its previously 
4 
requested amendment to limit medical cannabis certifications to those originating from within 
5 
the state, which serves to prevent mainland-based cannabis telehealth companies from operating 
6 
in Hawaii. This safeguard is especially important, as some of these companies have faced 
7 
scrutiny in other jurisdictions for questionable practices. 
8 
 
9 
Furthermore, the Department appreciates the removal of the provision that would have allowed 
10 
patients to purchase cannabis without first having their applications processed and receiving a 
11 
registration card from the Department. This provision posed risks, including exposing a subset of 
12 
patients to arrest for possession of a controlled substance without a physical medical cannabis 
13 
card and creating inaccuracies in sales tracking and patient verification systems within state-
14 
licensed dispensaries.

Thank you for the opportunity to testify.

Re:  Testimony In Support with Requested Amendments on House Bill (HB) 
302, House Draft (HD) 2 
RELATING TO CANNABIS 
 Repeals the requirement that a provider-patient relationship be established in 
person.  sEffective 7/1/3000.  
 
Dear Chair Tarnas, Vice-Chair Poepoe and Members of the Committee: 
Aloha Green Apothecary (“Aloha”) is a state licensed medical cannabis dispensary in 
Honolulu. Aloha supports HB302, HD1 which eases access issues for medical 
cannabis patients, but we request that the language which was removed in the prior 
committee be re-inserted to help avoid patient access delays.   
When created in 2015, the medical cannabis dispensary laws were one of the most 
rigorous and strict systems amongst the dozens of states that allowed medical 
cannabis.  Since that time, the nation’s landscape and our state’s attitudes over 
cannabis have also changed dramatically such that many states allow for adult use, and 
our state has decriminalized non-medical use. There is a thriving illicit market that 
makes it easy and cheaper to access cannabis, and there is now increased availability 
of THC through hemp-derived products. Yet, Hawaii’s medical cannabis system has 
hardly changed.  
This appears to be one of the driving reasons why the number of registered patients has 
declined 15% over the past 3 years.  While Aloha continues to provide safe products 
that are tracked from seed to sale, 3rd party lab tested against impurities and pesticides, 
labeled with dosage and warnings – less patients are getting their cannabis from 
dispensaries due to price and ease. 
The purpose of this bill is to ease some of the archaic hurdles in the law that have been 
in place since 2015 that no longer seem necessary.  The laws on telehealth were 
already revised in 2021 for parity of in-person and telehealth visits to create a bona fide 
physician-patient relationship, except for opiates and medical cannabis. That distinction 
for medical cannabis at this stage appears arbitrary, and the bill proposes to eliminate 
that difference.  
The bill in its original and HD1 form, also had language to allows a qualifying patient 
immediate access to enter a dispensary and purchase a limited amount of medical 
cannabis upon the Department of Health’s registry system recognizing the submission 
of a complete application.  Currently, a patient may wait anywhere from 3 days to a 
week to obtain their medical cannabis card or “329 card” which will then allow them to 

 
 
 
enter into a licensed dispensary.  This delay is often a significant barrier for patients 
who need their cannabis medication right away.  It not only is a possible deterrent to 
obtain a 329 card, but can also serve to push a patient towards obtaining product from 
the illicit market.  
At the prior hearings, we heard concerns from the Department of Health and AG about 
this immediate access – that there was little to no wait time as it currently stands; that a 
person who obtained this amount could be found to guilty for as much as a class C 
felony.  We disagree.   
While it is true some patients upon submission to the DOH get a quick response and 
obtain their registration, we are also aware of instances that have take a few to several 
days.  Moreover, should a patient submit their documentation just prior to or on a 
weekend, they will most certainly need to wait a few days. 
We also disagree that a patient who had immediate access would ever likely be 
prosecuted.  They would have their certifying documentation from a health provider, 
they would have a labeled packaged product identifying that it came from a dispensary. 
But, if it would help achieve a more acceptable approach, Aloha would propose 
lessening the amount for the one-time amount from fifty percent (50%) of the dispensing 
limit to twenty-five percent (25%) 
Therefore, we respectfully request that the committee amend the bill by adding back in 
the following language.  
In Section 2 of the bill, the language in yellow highlight be added back in:  
 "(a)  Physicians or advanced practice registered nurses who 
issue written certifications shall provide, in each written 
certification, the name, address, patient identification number, 
and other identifying information of the qualifying 
patient.  The department of health shall require, in rules 
adopted pursuant to chapter 91, that all written certifications 
comply with a designated form completed by or on behalf of a 
qualifying patient.  The form shall require information from the 
applicant, primary caregiver, and physician or advanced practice 
registered nurse as specifically required or permitted by this 
chapter.  The form shall require the address of the location 
where the cannabis is grown and shall appear on the registry 
card issued by the department of health.  The certifying 
physician or advanced practice registered nurse shall be 
required to have a bona fide physician-patient relationship or 
bona fide advanced practice registered nurse-patient 
relationship, as applicable, with the qualifying patient[.]; 
provided that nothing under this part shall require that the 
bona fide physician-patient relationship or bona fide advanced 
practice registered nurse-patient relationship be established by 

 
 
 
conducting an initial in-person consultation.  After the 
submission of the applicant's form but before receipt of 
confirmed registration from the department of health, the 
applicant or primary caregiver may use the submission of the 
applicant's form as proof and documentation authorizing the 
applicant or primary caregiver to enter and make a one-time 
purchase of cannabis from a medical cannabis dispensary licensed 
under chapter 329D in an amount that is no more than twenty-five 
per cent of the dispensing limits under section 329D-13.  The 
department of health office of medical cannabis control and 
regulation shall facilitate the temporary authorization for 
applicants and primary caregivers.  All current active medical 
cannabis permits shall be honored through their expiration 
date." 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify.

RE: 
H.B. 302, HD2 – Relating to Cannabis 
Hearing Date: Tuesday, February 25, 2025 at 2:00 p.m. 
Conference Room: 325 
 
Dear Chair Tarnas, Vice Chair Poepoe, and Members of the Committee on Judiciary 
& Hawaiian Affairs: 
 
We submit this testimony on behalf of Cure Oahu in support of H.B. 302, HD2, 
Relating to Cannabis, which repeals the requirement that a provider-patient 
relationship be established in person. 
 
Cure Oahu supports this bill because it will ease the difficulties on patients and 
primary caregivers to navigate the registration process for the medical cannabis 
program.  The number of registered medical cannabis patients has been in decline 
since 2021.  There are various issues with the registration process - including the 
limited number of providers participating in the certification process, the costs 
incurred by patients as part of the certification process, and the proliferation of illicit 
market products.  
 
We believe that access to medical cannabis should be as streamlined as possible to 
ensure that patients can obtain their medical cannabis cards and access medical 
cannabis in a way that keeps patients and the public safe rather than bypassing the 
medical program altogether. Allowing full access via telehealth and providing the 
temporary purchase of small amounts of cannabis will help streamline access while 
balancing public safety concerns. 
 
For these reasons, we support this measure and ask that the Committee pass H.B. 
302, HD2.  Thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony in support of this 
measure.

State Capitol, Room 325 & Videoconference 
 
This bill is very important for patients who have difficulty attending in-person certification 
evaluations, especially patients on outer islands where access to certifying providers is 
limited. 
 
If this committee wishes to make further changes to Hawaii’s Medical Use of Cannabis 
Act that would improve patient access and encourage program participation, then it may 
want to consider the following amendments: 
 
Allowing certifying providers to decide qualifying conditions: 
 
§329-121  Definitions.  As used in this part: 
 "Debilitating medical condition" means any condition determined by the certifying 
physician or APRN. [ : 
     (1)  Cancer, glaucoma, lupus, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, 
positive status for human immunodeficiency virus, acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome, or the treatment of these conditions; 
     (2)  A chronic or debilitating disease or medical condition or its treatment that 
produces one or more of the following: 
          (A)  Cachexia or wasting syndrome; 
          (B)  Severe pain; 
          (C)  Severe nausea; 
          (D)  Seizures, including those characteristic of epilepsy; 

HB302 HD2-WRITTEN TESTIMONY-OTTO-25FEB25 
2 
 
          (E)  Severe and persistent muscle spasms, including those characteristic of 
multiple sclerosis or Crohn's disease; or 
          (F)  Post-traumatic stress disorder; or 
     (3)  Any other medical condition approved by the department of health pursuant to 
administrative rules in response to a request from a physician or advanced practice 
registered nurse or potentially qualifying patient. ] 
 
Providing immediate registration approval: 
 
§329-123  Registration requirements; qualifying patients; primary caregivers.  
    (a)  Physicians or advanced practice registered nurses who issue written 
certifications shall provide, in each written certification, the name, address, patient 
identification number, and other identifying information of the qualifying patient.  The 
department of health shall require, in rules adopted pursuant to chapter 91, that all 
written certifications comply with a designated form completed by or on behalf of a 
qualifying patient.  The form shall require information from the applicant, primary 
caregiver, and physician or advanced practice registered nurse as specifically required 
or permitted by this chapter.  The form shall require the address of the location where 
the cannabis is grown and shall appear on the registry card issued by the department of 
health.  The certifying physician or advanced practice registered nurse shall be required 
to have a bona fide physician-patient relationship or bona fide advanced practice 
registered nurse-patient relationship, as applicable, with the qualifying patient.  All 
current active medical cannabis permits shall be honored through their expiration date. 
     (b)  Qualifying patients shall register with the department of health.  The registration 
shall be effective until the expiration of the certificate issued by the department of health 
and signed by the physician or advanced practice registered nurse.  Every qualifying 
patient shall provide sufficient identifying information to establish the personal identities 
of the qualifying patient and the primary caregiver.  Qualifying patients shall report 
changes in information within ten working days.  Every qualifying patient shall have only 
one primary caregiver at any given time.  The department of health shall issue to the 
qualifying patient a registration certificate and may charge a fee for the certificate in an 
amount adopted by rules pursuant to chapter 91. 
     (c)  Primary caregivers shall register with the department of health.  Every primary 
caregiver shall be responsible for the care of only one qualifying patient at any given 
time, unless the primary caregiver is the parent, guardian, or person having legal 
custody of more than one minor qualifying patient, in which case the primary caregiver 
may be responsible for the care of more than one minor qualifying patient at any given 
time; provided that the primary caregiver is the parent, guardian, or person having legal 
custody of all of the primary caregiver's qualifying patients.  The department of health 
may permit registration of up to two primary caregivers for a minor qualifying patient; 
provided that both primary caregivers are the parent, guardian, or person having legal 
custody of the minor qualifying patient. 

HB302 HD2-WRITTEN TESTIMONY-OTTO-25FEB25 
3 
 
     (d)  Upon inquiry by a law enforcement agency, which inquiry may be made twenty-
four hours a day, seven days a week, the department of health shall immediately verify 
whether the subject of the inquiry has registered with the department of health and may 
provide reasonable access to the registry information for official law enforcement 
purposes. 
     (e) The department shall use AI technology to make registration approval 
instantaneous.  In those instances where application errors are detected, the defective 
application shall be immediately returned to the certifying physician or APRN for 
correction and resubmission. 
     (f) [ (e) ] This section shall not apply to registration of a qualifying out-of-state patient 
or a caregiver of a qualifying out-of-state patient.

Re:  
Testimony In Strong Support on House Bill (HB) 302 RELATING TO CANNABIS  
 
Repeals the requirement that a provider-patient relationship be established in person. Allows applicants 
or primary caregivers to temporarily purchase medical cannabis after the submission of the applicant's 
certification form.  
 
Dear Chair Tarnas, Vice-Chair Poepoe and Members of the Committee:  
 
Big Island Grown, a state-licensed medical cannabis dispensary operating in Hawaii County, stands in 
strong support of HB 302. Over the past three years, the number of patients registered to receive medical 
cannabis has dropped by over 15%. One of the primary causes of this decline are regulatory barriers for 
patients to access cannabis through the legal dispensary system.   
 
Currently, patients must be certified as having one or more qualifying conditions via an in-person 
diagnosis from a small pool of registered certifying providers. Patients then wait days to receive a medical 
cannabis card to be eligible to even enter a state-licensed dispensary for their cannabis medication. For 
many patients who are terminally ill or in severe chronic pain, an in-person visit can be logistically 
challenging to schedule and make travel arrangements for. Based on the severity of circumstance, any 
delay in a patient’s ability to access medical cannabis via the state-licensed dispensary system may simply 
drive them to alternate untested, unregulated sources. Legal access to medical cannabis via the 
dispensary system should be immediate following certification by a provider, especially for terminal 
patients.  
 
HB302 seeks to address these challenges and bolster patients’ access to cannabis medication by: 
 
• 
Allowing initial physician consultation to occur via telemedicine – a safe and common medical 
practice used increasingly since the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 
Please consider adding the provision back into the bill that would allow patients to temporarily purchase 
a limited quantity of cannabis medication upon submission of a certification form and while awaiting 
delivery of the medical cannabis patient card.   
 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify in strong support. Without these important changes to the 
medical cannabis program, patient access to care will continue to decline and risk to public safety will 
increase as patients continue to turn to alternate untested, unregulated sources for their medical 
cannabis needs.
