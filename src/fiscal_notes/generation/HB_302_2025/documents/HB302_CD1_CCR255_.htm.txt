medical condition";
(2)
Authorizing the sale of hemp products and
accessories to the use of medical cannabis in a medical cannabis dispensary
waiting room;

certain types of dispensary-to-dispensary purchases of cannabis or manufactured

Prohibit the cultivation of cannabis without a
license issued by the

Authorize expenditures from the Medical

mitigation and abatement of nuisances related to medical cannabis dispensaries
and appropriate funds to the
Attorney General's Drug Nuisance Abatement Unit for these
purposes.
Your Committee on
Conference has amended this measure by:
(1)
Reverting to the existing statutory definition
of "debilitating medical condition";
(2)

Department of Health
to
inspect a qualifying patient's medical records that are held by the physician,

certification for the qualifying patient;

Amending the definitions of "qualifying
patient" and "written certification" and adding a definition for
"primary treating medical provider";

medical use of cannabis;
(5)
Authorizing the sale of hemp products and
accessories to the medical use of cannabis at retail dispensing locations,
except in the waiting room;
(6)
Establishing criminal penalties for the
unlicensed operation of a medical cannabis dispensary beginning July 1, 2025,
rather than January 1, 2027;
(7)
Authorizing expenditures from the Medical
Cannabis Registry and Regulation Special Fund to fund programs for the
mitigation and abatement of nuisances related to illegal cannabis and hemp
products as well as medical cannabis dispensaries;
(8)
Inserting an appropriation of $750,000 from
the Medical Cannabis Registry and Regulation Special Fund for the mitigation
and abatement of nuisances related to illegal cannabis and hemp products and
medical cannabis dispensaries, including the establishment of positions;
(9)
Prohibiting the cultivation of cannabis
without a license issued by the
Department of Health beginning January 1,
2028, rather than January 1, 2027, and deleting certain provisions relating to the
maximum number of cannabis cultivator licenses and maximum plant canopy size;
(10)
Changing the effective date to July 1, 2025;
and
(11)
Making technical, nonsubstantive amendments for
the purposes of clarity, consistency, and style.
