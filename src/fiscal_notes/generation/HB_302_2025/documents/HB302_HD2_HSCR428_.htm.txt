RE:
H.B. No. 302
H.D.
2
Honorable Nadine K. Nakamura
Speaker, House of Representatives
Thirty-Third State Legislature
Regular Session of 2025
State of Hawaii
Madame:
Your Committee on Consumer
Protection & Commerce, to which was referred H.B. No. 302, H.D. 1,
entitled:
"A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO CANNABIS,"
begs leave to report as follows:
The
purpose of this measure is to:
(1)
Repeal the requirement
that a provider-patient relationship be established in person for purposes of
obtaining a certification for medical cannabis; and
(2)
Allow applicants or
primary caregivers to temporarily purchase medical cannabis after the
submission of the applicant's certification form.
Your Committee received testimony in support of this measure
from the Hawai
Ê»
i Cannabis Industry Association; Cure
Oahu; Big Island Grown; Noa Botanicals; and one individual.
Your Committee received comments on this
measure from the Department of the Attorney General; Department of Health; and
Akamai Cannabis Consulting.
Your Committee finds that the number of registered medical
cannabis patients has been in decline since 2021.
There are various issues with the
registration process, particularly the number of providers participating in the
certification process.
This measure
eases the hurdle of access to participating providers by repealing the
requirement that a provider-patient relationship be established in person for
purposes of obtaining a certification for medical cannabis.
Your Committee has amended this measure by:
(1)
Specifying that written certifications must
originate from within the State;
(2)
Deleting language that allowed applicants or
primary caregivers to temporarily purchase medical cannabis after the
submission of the applicant's certification form; and
(3)
Making technical, nonsubstantive amendments
for the purposes of clarity, consistency, and style.
As affirmed by the
record of votes of the members of your Committee on Consumer Protection &
Commerce that is attached to this report, your Committee is in accord with the
intent and purpose of H.B. No. 302, H.D. 1, as amended herein, and recommends that
it be referred to your Committee on Judiciary & Hawaiian Affairs in the
form attached hereto as H.B. No. 302, H.D. 2.
Respectfully
submitted on behalf of the members of the Committee on Consumer Protection
& Commerce,
