RE:
H.B. No. 302
H.D.
1
Honorable Nadine K. Nakamura
Speaker, House of Representatives
Thirty-Third State Legislature
Regular Session of 2025
State of Hawaii
Madame:
Your Committee on Health,
to which was referred H.B. No. 302 entitled:
"A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO CANNABIS,"
begs leave to report as follows:
The
purpose of this measure
is to:
(1)
Repeal the requirement
that a provider-patient relationship be established in person for purposes of
obtaining a certification for medical cannabis; and
(2)
Allow applicants or
primary caregivers to temporarily purchase medical cannabis after the
submission of the applicant's certification form.
Your Committee received testimony in support of this measure
from the Hawai
â€˜
i Cannabis Industry Association; Aloha
Green Apothecary; Cure Oahu; Noa Botanicals; and Big Island Grown Dispensaries.
Your Committee received comments on this
measure from the Department of the Attorney General; Department of Health; and
Akamai Cannabis Consulting.
Your Committee finds
that access for qualifying patients and primary caregivers to medical cannabis
remains challenging due to limited access to medical providers, delays in
obtaining authorizations for access to enter and purchase medical cannabis from
licensed medical cannabis dispensaries, and a thriving illicit market.
Your Committee further finds that between
August 2021 and November 2024, the number of registered card-holding patients in
Hawaii decreased by fifteen percent, indicating that qualifying patients are
shifting away from licensed medical cannabis dispensaries and instead obtaining
their medical cannabis from elsewhere.
Your Committee believes that reducing some of the administrative
barriers to accessing medical cannabis, as intended by this measure, will
support the State's medical cannabis program and encourage qualifying patients
to access medical cannabis in a manner that ensures patient safety, product
safety, and public safety.
Your
Committee has amended this measure by:
(1)
Changing the effective date to July 1, 3000,
to encourage further discussion; and
(2)
Making technical, nonsubstantive amendments
for the purposes of clarity, consistency, and style.
As affirmed by the
record of votes of the members of your Committee on Health that is attached to
this report, your Committee is in accord with the intent and purpose of H.B.
No. 302, as amended herein, and recommends that it pass Second Reading in the form
attached hereto as H.B. No. 302, H.D. 1, and be referred to your Committee on
Consumer Protection & Commerce.
Respectfully
submitted on behalf of the members of the Committee on Health,
