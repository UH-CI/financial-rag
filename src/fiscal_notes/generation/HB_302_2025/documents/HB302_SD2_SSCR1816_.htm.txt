ʻ
i Cannabis Industry

Your Committees
received testimony in opposition to this measure from the Oahu Cannabis Farms
Alliance.
Your Committees
received comments on this measure from the Department of the Attorney General,
Department of Health, Akamai Cannabis Consulting, and one individual.
Your Committees
find that the State's medical dispensary program is suffering from regulatory
barriers that make operations difficult to sustain while facing increasing
threats of competition from the unregulated market, including street sales and
the proliferation of unregulated, high-potency THC cannabis, sold under the
guise of being hemp, currently available at retailers across the State.
This measure will lower the barrier to entry
for patients to access the legal dispensary system while maintaining quality
standards for licensees to ensure access to clean and tested cannabis.
Your Committees
note that this measure, as written, establishes a criminal offense for
unlicensed operation of a dispensary; however, the required state of mind is
not clearly stated, and therefore amendments to this measure are necessary.
Accordingly,
your Committees have amended this measure by:
(1)
Clarifying
that the state of mind requirement for the offense of operating a dispensary
without a license from the Department of Health pursuant to chapter 329D, HRS,
is intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly
;
(2)
Specifying
that a person who intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly operates any search
platform, web hosting service, social media platform, or other entity that
posts information advertising the sale of cannabis products by an unlicensed
person or entity engaged in the production, manufacture, or sale of cannabis or
manufactured cannabis products without a license pursuant to chapter 329D, HRS,
is guilty of a misdemeanor
;
(3)
Specifying
that a person issued a cannabis cultivator license is required to meet all
production facility and processing requirements under chapter 329D, HRS;
(4)
Inserting
language specifying that the Department of the Attorney General's Drug Nuisance
Abatement Unit may enforce nuisances relating to chapter 329D, HRS;
(5)
Specifying
that the appropriation for the Department of the Attorney General to enforce,
and mitigate nuisances relating to, chapter 329D, HRS, shall be expended by the
Attorney General;
(6)
Inserting
an effective date of January 1, 2027, for the requirement of cannabis
cultivator licenses; and
(7)
Making
technical, nonsubstantive amendments for the purposes of clarity and
consistency.
As affirmed by the
records of votes of the members of your Committees on Judiciary and Ways and
Means that are attached to this report, your Committees are in accord with the
intent and purpose of H.B. No. 302, H.D. 2, S.D. 1, as amended herein,
and recommend that it pass Third Reading in the form attached hereto as H.B.
No. 302, H.D. 2, S.D. 2.
Respectfully submitted on behalf
of the members of the Committees on Judiciary and Ways and Means,
