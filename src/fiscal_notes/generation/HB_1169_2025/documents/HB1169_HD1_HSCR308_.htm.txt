Establish a new
University of Hawaii Conference Center Revolving Fund to facilitate the
administration of the revolving fund for conference center programs among
various campuses and operating units of the University of Hawaii System;

appropriations and encumbrances of the Conference Center Revolving Fund,
University of Hawaii at Hilo; and the Community College Conference Center

and
(4)
Appropriate funds out
of the University of Hawaii Conference Center Revolving Fund.
Your Committee received testimony in support of this measure
from the University of Hawai

Your Committee
finds that establishing a single conference center revolving fund within the University
of Hawaii System would standardize implementation of conference center programs
across the various campuses of the University of Hawaii System, thereby
increasing access to conference center usage on University of Hawaii campuses.
Your Committee has
amended this measure by:
(1)
Clarifying that all unencumbered funds in the Conference
Center Revolving Fund, University of Hawaii at Hilo; and the Community College
Conference Center Revolving Fund shall lapse to the University of Hawaii
Conference Center Revolving Fund on the effective date of this measure;
(2)
Changing the effective date to July 1, 3000,
to encourage further discussion; and
(3)
Making technical, nonsubstantive amendments
for the purposes of clarity, consistency, and style.
As
affirmed by the record of votes of the members of your
Committee
on Higher Education that is attached to this report, your
Committee
is in accord with the intent and purpose of
H.B.
No. 1169, as amended herein, and recommends that it pass Second Reading in the
form attached hereto as
H.B. No. 1169, H.D. 1, and be
referred to your
Committee on Finance.
Respectfully
submitted on behalf of the members of the
Committee on
Higher Education,
