University of Hawai‘i System 
HB 1169 HD1 – RELATING TO UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII CONFERENCE CENTER 
REVOLVING FUND 
Chair Kim, Vice Chair Kidani, and Members of the Committee: 
Thank you for the opportunity to present testimony today.  The University of Hawai‘i 
(UH) supports HB 1169 HD1, Relating to University of Hawaii Conference Center 
Revolving Fund.  This bill establishes the University of Hawaii Conference Center 
Revolving Fund and accounts under the fund to facilitate the administration of the fund 
for conference center programs among various campuses and operating units of the 
UH system. 
 
Conference Center Revolving Funds currently exist for the Community Colleges and 
UH-Hilo.  This bill would create one UH Conference Center Revolving Fund and allow 
all campuses to utilize their own account within this overarching fund.  This would allow 
all campuses to standardize conference center programs across all campuses while 
eliminating unnecessary duplication of statutes.  This structure would mirror successful 
models of other UH funds, notably the Tuition and Fees Special Fund, the Auxiliary 
Enterprises Special Fund, and the Student Activities Revolving Fund. 
 
Thank you for this opportunity to testify.
