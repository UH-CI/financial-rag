Information regarding fiscal years, specific amounts, or intended uses for appropriations is not mentioned. Therefore, no appropriations are identified in the context provided.",

There are no references to comparable programs or historical budgets to determine the fiscal impact. The methodology for assessing the financial implications is not described.",
  "agency_impact": "The measure will impact the University of Hawaii System by standardizing its conference center programs and simplifying the administration of conference center funds. This is expected to create administrative efficiencies by consolidating two separate funds into one. The document does not provide details on changes to staffing, supervision, or specific resource allocation.",

  "revenue_sources": "The measure establishes a revolving fund, but the specific sources of revenue that will support it are not identified in the document. While revolving funds typically consist of program-generated income, the document does not describe these streams. No mention is made of general funds, grants, or fees.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The provided committee report does not offer a six-year fiscal outlook for the measure. There are no projections regarding future costs, staffing changes, or recurring expenses. The document also lacks assumptions about program expansion or permanence. Consequently, the multi-year fiscal implications cannot be determined from the text. The focus is on the administrative structure rather than long-term financial planning. No financial data is present to construct a fiscal forecast. The implications for future budgets are not addressed. The long-term costs and revenues associated with the consolidated fund are not detailed. Therefore, a six-year projection is not possible based on the available information.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The measure is expected to impact operating revenues by consolidating them from two existing funds into a single new revolving fund. However, the document does not specify whether this will result in an increase, decrease, or other change to the overall revenue streams. The primary impact is administrative consolidation rather than a change in revenue generation.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The legislative document does not mention any capital expenditures related to this measure. There is no information regarding investments in facilities, equipment, or technology infrastructure. Therefore, no capital expenditure impact is anticipated based on the provided text.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The document does not provide information on the fiscal obligations beyond a six-year period. Ongoing annual operating costs and the sustainability of funding for the new revolving fund are not discussed. The long-term fiscal implications are therefore unknown.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "No previous fiscal note was provided in the context documents. Therefore, a comparison or summary of updates cannot be made. This section is not applicable."
