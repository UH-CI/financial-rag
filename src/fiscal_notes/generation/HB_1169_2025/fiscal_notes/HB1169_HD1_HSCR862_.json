  "overview": "This measure establishes the University of Hawaii Conference Center Revolving Fund to consolidate and standardize the administration of conference center programs across all University of Hawai‘i (UH) system campuses. It repeals the separate Conference Center Revolving Funds for the University of Hawaii at Hilo and the Community Colleges. All unencumbered funds from the repealed funds will be lapsed into the new, system-wide revolving fund.",
  "appropriations": "This bill appropriates funds out of the newly established University of Hawaii Conference Center Revolving Fund for its intended purposes. It also directs that all unencumbered balances from the repealed UH-Hilo and Community College conference center revolving funds be transferred to the new fund. The specific dollar amount of the transfer is not detailed in the provided documents.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal analysis is based on the assumption that the bill will be enacted and implemented as written. The methodology involves consolidating existing funds into a single, overarching fund with separate accounts for each campus. This approach is modeled after other successful UH system-wide funds, such as the Tuition and Fees Special Fund.",
  "agency_impact": "The University of Hawai‘i System anticipates a positive administrative impact, as the measure will standardize conference center programs and eliminate duplicative statutes. This consolidation will create a more efficient administrative structure for managing conference funds across the system. It aligns the management of these funds with other major UH financial structures.",
  "economic_impact": "The primary economic impact of this measure is expected to be internal administrative efficiencies within the UH system. By streamlining the management of conference center funds, the university can improve operational effectiveness. No broader economic impact on the state is anticipated based on the provided documents.",
  "policy_impact": "This measure changes state policy by repealing statutes that authorized separate conference center revolving funds for specific UH campuses. It establishes a new, centralized policy for managing these funds under a single statute for the entire UH system. This reflects a broader strategy of standardizing administrative and financial structures within the university.",
  "revenue_sources": "The sole revenue source for the program will be the new University of Hawaii Conference Center Revolving Fund. This fund will be financed by revenues generated from conference center activities across all UH campuses. It will be initially capitalized by the transfer of existing balances from the repealed campus-specific funds.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The primary fiscal implication is the consolidation of existing fund balances into the new University of Hawaii Conference Center Revolving Fund. This measure is not expected to generate new revenue or create significant new costs but will streamline financial administration. For the next six years, all revenues from conference center programs will be deposited into, and all expenditures will be made from, this single fund. The structure allows for separate accounts for each campus to maintain fiscal accountability at the local level. The University anticipates administrative efficiencies from this consolidation. The bill authorizes appropriations from the new fund to support its purpose, ensuring operational continuity for conference center programs system-wide. Overall, the fiscal impact is expected to be neutral, with potential savings from reduced administrative complexity.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "This measure will not create new operating revenue but will restructure how existing revenue is managed. Revenues from all UH conference center programs will now be deposited into one consolidated fund rather than multiple separate ones. This change centralizes the accounting and administration of these revenue streams.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The provided documents do not indicate that this measure will have any direct impact on capital expenditures. The bill's focus is on restructuring the management of operating funds for conference centers. No new capital projects or expenditures are authorized by this bill.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "After six years, the consolidated University of Hawaii Conference Center Revolving Fund will continue to operate as the central financial mechanism for all UH conference center programs. The ongoing fiscal implication will be the sustained administrative efficiency of managing a single, standardized fund. This structure is intended to be permanent and self-sustaining.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The previous fiscal note concluded there was no fiscal impact because the bill had an amended effective date of July 1, 3000, rendering it inoperative. This updated fiscal note is based on documents that treat the bill as a substantive measure intended for passage and implementation. Therefore, this analysis now details the fiscal and operational impacts of establishing the new consolidated fund, repealing the old funds, and transferring their balances, all of which were considered moot in the prior note."
