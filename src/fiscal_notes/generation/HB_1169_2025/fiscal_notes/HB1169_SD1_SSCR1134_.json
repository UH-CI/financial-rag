  "overview": "This measure establishes a single, system-wide University of Hawaii Conference Center Revolving Fund, repealing the separate funds for the University of Hawaii at Hilo and the Community Colleges (HB1169_SD1). It directs that all appropriations and encumbrances from the previous funds be lapsed into the new, consolidated fund (HB1169_SD1). The intent is to standardize conference center program administration across all campuses and eliminate redundant statutes (HB1169_HD1_TESTIMONY_HRE_03-11-25_).",

  "agency_impact": "The University of Hawaiâ€˜i System reiterated its support for the measure in testimony before the Senate Committee on Higher Education, stating the new fund structure would mirror other successful system-wide funds (HB1169_HD1_TESTIMONY_HRE_03-11-25_). This administrative change is expected to streamline operations by allowing all campuses to use a single overarching fund with individual campus accounts (HB1169_HD1_TESTIMONY_HRE_03-11-25_). The consolidation will eliminate the need for unnecessarily duplicative statutes for separate revolving funds (HB1169_HD1_TESTIMONY_HRE_03-11-25_).",

No new revenue sources are established by this measure. The fund will continue to be supported by revenues generated by conference center programs.",
