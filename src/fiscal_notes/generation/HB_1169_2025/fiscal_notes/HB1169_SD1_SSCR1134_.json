The University of Hawai‘i (UH) supports the bill, which would \"facilitate the administration of the fund for conference center programs among various campuses and operating units of the UH system\" (HB1169_HD1_TESTIMONY_HRE_03-11-25_). The Committee on Higher Education has amended this measure by \"Making it effective upon its approval\" and recommends that it pass Second Reading and be referred to the Committee on Ways and Means (HB1169_SD1).",
  "appropriations": "This measure will \"Lapse all appropriations and encumbrances of the Conference Center Revolving Fund and the University of Hawaii at Hilo and the Community College Conference Center Revolving Fund to the University of Hawaii Conference Center Revolving Fund\" (HB1169_SD1). It also intends to \"Appropriate funds out of the University of Hawaii Conference Center Revolving Fund\" (HB1169_SD1). No specific dollar amounts for new appropriations are provided in the documents.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The methodology for the new fund's structure is based on existing successful models within the University of Hawai'i system. This structure is intended to \"mirror successful models of other UH funds, notably the Tuition and Fees Special Fund, the Auxiliary Enterprises Special Fund, and the Student Activities Revolving Fund\" (HB1169_HD1_TESTIMONY_HRE_03-11-25_). This approach would allow all campuses to standardize conference center programs while eliminating redundant statutory provisions (HB1169_SD1).",
  "agency_impact": "The University of Hawaiʻi System submitted testimony in support of this measure (HB1169_SD1). The bill is expected to positively impact the agency by allowing all campuses to \"utilize their own account within this overarching fund,\" which will help \"standardize conference center programs across all campuses while eliminating unnecessary duplication of statutes\" (HB1169_HD1_TESTIMONY_HRE_03-11-25_). This structure is intended to make the fund consistent with other existing University of Hawaii funds (HB1169_SD1).",
  "economic_impact": "Creating a single University of Hawaii Conference Center Revolving Fund is expected to create efficiencies by \"eliminating redundant provisions\" (HB1169_SD1). This consolidation would allow the university system to \"standardize conference center programs across all campuses while eliminating unnecessary duplication of statutes\" (HB1169_HD1_TESTIMONY_HRE_03-11-25_). The measure aims to make the fund structure \"consistent with other existing University of Hawaii funds\" (HB1169_SD1).",
  "policy_impact": "The Committee on Higher Education has amended this measure by \"Making it effective upon its approval\" and making \"technical, nonsubstantive amendments for the purposes of clarity and consistency\" (HB1169_SD1). With these amendments, the committee recommends that H.B. No. 1169, H.D. 1, pass Second Reading as H.B. No. 1169, H.D. 1, S.D. 1 (HB1169_SD1). The measure is now referred to the Committee on Ways and Means (HB1169_SD1).",
  "revenue_sources": "The initial funding for the new University of Hawaii Conference Center Revolving Fund will come from the balances of the two funds it is replacing. The measure specifies to \"Lapse all appropriations and encumbrances of the Conference Center Revolving Fund and the University of Hawaii at Hilo and the Community College Conference Center Revolving Fund to the University of Hawaii Conference Center Revolving Fund\" (HB1169_SD1). The documents do not identify any new sources of revenue.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The previous fiscal note's expectation of immediate fiscal implications is now confirmed, as the Committee on Higher Education has amended the measure by \"Making it effective upon its approval\" (HB1169_SD1). This bill would create one UH Conference Center Revolving Fund and allow all campuses to have their own account within it, which would standardize conference center programs and eliminate \"unnecessary duplication of statutes\" (HB1169_HD1_TESTIMONY_HRE_03-11-25_). This new structure would mirror other successful UH funds like the Tuition and Fees Special Fund (HB1169_HD1_TESTIMONY_HRE_03-11-25_). The measure repeals the existing Conference Center Revolving Fund and the University of Hawaii at Hilo and the Community College Conference Center Revolving Fund, lapsing all their appropriations and encumbrances to the new fund (HB1169_SD1). While this consolidation implies administrative savings, the documents do not provide specific cost or revenue projections for the six-year period.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "This measure will consolidate existing operating revenues from two separate funds into a single, new revolving fund. It directs to \"Lapse all appropriations and encumbrances of the Conference Center Revolving Fund and the University of Hawaii at Hilo and the Community College Conference Center Revolving Fund to the University of Hawaii Conference Center Revolving Fund\" (HB1169_SD1). This will not create new revenue but will centralize the administration of funds for conference center programs across the University of Hawaii System (HB1169_HD1_TESTIMONY_HRE_03-11-25_).",

  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The primary update is the bill's progression to the Senate Committee on Higher Education, which has amended it and recommends it pass Second Reading as H.B. No. 1169, H.D. 1, S.D. 1 (HB1169_SD1). The committee's amendment makes the bill \"effective upon its approval,\" officially removing the prior version's deferred effective date and confirming the immediate fiscal impact previously anticipated (HB1169_SD1). The University of Hawaiʻi System provided testimony in support, noting the new structure would \"mirror successful models of other UH funds\" (HB1169_HD1_TESTIMONY_HRE_03-11-25_)."
