  "overview": "The purpose and intent of this measure is to establish the university of Hawaii conference center revolving fund and repeal two existing conference center funds (HB1169_SD2). The University of Hawai‘i (UH) supports HB 1169 HD1 SD1, which will establish the fund and accounts to \"facilitate the administration of the fund for conference center programs among various campuses and operating units of the UH system\" (HB1169_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-28-25_). The Committee on Ways and Means finds that a single revolving fund will \"help to standardize conference center programs across all campuses of the University of Hawaii System and facilitate the administration of conference center moneys\" (HB1169_SD2).",
