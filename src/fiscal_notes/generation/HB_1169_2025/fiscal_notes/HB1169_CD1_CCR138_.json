  "overview": "This measure establishes the University of Hawaii Conference Center Revolving Fund to streamline the administration of conference programs across the UH System. The bill repeals the separate revolving funds for the University of Hawaii at Hilo and the Community Colleges. All unencumbered balances from the repealed funds are to be transferred into the new, consolidated fund on July 1, 2025 (HB1169_CD1).",
  "appropriations": "The Conference Committee amended the measure to remove a previously included appropriation (HB1169_CD1_CCR138_). As a result, the final version of the bill does not appropriate any new funds. The program will be supported by existing fund balances and future revenue from fees and charges.",

  "policy_impact": "This measure repeals sections 304A-2272 and 304A-2273 of the Hawaii Revised Statutes, which authorized separate conference center revolving funds for the University of Hawaii at Hilo and the Community Colleges (HB1169_CD1). It establishes a new, single revolving fund for the entire University of Hawaii System to centralize financial administration. The Conference Committee's amendments removed an appropriation, focusing the bill's final intent on administrative consolidation rather than new program funding (HB1169_CD1_CCR138_).",
  "revenue_sources": "The University of Hawaii Conference Center Revolving Fund will be sustained by fees, charges, and other moneys collected from its conference center programs (HB1169_CD1). The initial balance will consist of all unencumbered funds from the repealed conference center revolving funds for UH Hilo and the community colleges, which will lapse to the new fund on July 1, 2025 (HB1169_CD1). No new general funds are designated for this fund.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The fiscal impact over the next six years is expected to be minimal, as this measure primarily consolidates existing funds rather than creating new financial obligations. It authorizes the transfer of unencumbered balances from two existing revolving funds into a new, single fund for administrative efficiency (HB1169_CD1). No new appropriations are made, and future operations are intended to be self-sustaining through program fees. The University will be required to submit an annual report to the legislature accounting for all income and expenditures within the fund (HB1169_CD1).",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "This measure is not anticipated to change the total operating revenue for the University of Hawaii. It will consolidate revenue from conference fees and charges, which were previously held in separate accounts, into a single University of Hawaii Conference Center Revolving Fund (HB1169_CD1). This is an administrative change designed to streamline fund management.",

  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The measure was amended by a Conference Committee, resulting in H.B. No. 1169, H.D. 1, S.D. 2, C.D. 1, which now awaits final passage (HB1169_CD1_CCR138_). The most substantial change is the removal of the appropriation that was present in a prior version of the bill (HB1169_CD1_CCR138_). The bill's scope is now limited to establishing a single, system-wide conference center revolving fund and repealing the separate campus-specific funds."
