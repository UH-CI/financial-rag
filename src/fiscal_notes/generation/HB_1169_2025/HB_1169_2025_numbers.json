    "text": "of the UH system. Conference Center Revolving Funds currently exist for the Community Colleges and UH-Hilo. This bill would create one UH Conference Center Revolving Fund and allow all campuses to utilize their own account within this overarching fund. This would allow all campuses to standardize conference center programs across all campuses while eliminating unnecessary duplication of statutes. This structure would mirror successful models of other UH funds, notably the Tuition and Fees Special Fund, the Auxiliary Enterprises Special Fund, and the Student Activities Revolving Fund.
