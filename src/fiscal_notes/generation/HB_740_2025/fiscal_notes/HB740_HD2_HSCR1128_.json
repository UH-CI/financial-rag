  "overview": "The purpose of this measure is to establish the Accessory Dwelling Unit Financing and Deed Restriction Program, which allocates funds from the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund to counties (HB740_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_). These funds will provide grants to homeowners for ADU construction costs and allow counties to purchase perpetual deed restrictions on the properties (HB740_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_). As affirmed in the latest committee report, the bill is recommended to pass Third Reading without amendments (HB740_HD2_HSCR1128_).",
  "appropriations": "",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "Financial projections are based on testimony estimating Accessory Dwelling Unit construction costs at approximately $250 (HB740_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_) to $350 (HB740_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_) per square foot. The Department of Taxation assumes no material revenue impact from the associated conveyance tax exemption (HB740_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_). The methodology does not account for potential impacts to county real property tax revenues, a concern raised in testimony (HB740_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_).",
  "agency_impact": "Testimony from the City and County of Honolulu indicates significant agency impact, citing a lack of capacity, positions, and administrative funding to implement the program (HB740_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_). It is unclear if Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund moneys can be used for administrative purposes, and the county would require additional resources to manage the purchase and ownership of deed restrictions (HB740_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_). The City and County of Honolulu also requests statutory immunity for its officers and employees, similar to that provided for state personnel in the bill (HB740_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_).",
  "economic_impact": "The program intends to mitigate high ADU construction costs, which testimony estimates at $250 (HB740_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_) to $350 (HB740_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_) per square foot, thereby increasing the supply of rental units. The Department of Taxation estimates no material revenue impact from the bill's conveyance tax exemption (HB740_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_). However, the City and County of Honolulu raised concerns about potential negative impacts on real property tax revenues (HB740_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_).",
  "policy_impact": "The measure's policy of using perpetual deed restrictions has generated concern, with testimony from the Hawai‘i Association of REALTORS® suggesting they be amortized over 10 years instead (HB740_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_). Testimony also highlights policy gaps, such as the lack of an Area Median Income (AMI) requirement to ensure affordability and the absence of restrictions on short-term rentals, creating a potential for abuse (HB740_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_). These issues could impact the program's effectiveness in creating long-term affordable housing for the local workforce.",
  "revenue_sources": "The program will be funded through allocations from the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund (DURF) to the counties (HB740_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_). Testimony from the City and County of Honolulu questions whether these DURF funds can cover necessary administrative costs for program implementation and enforcement (HB740_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_). The bill also allows counties to establish and collect fees and premiums to cover costs, though testimony suggests this may be insufficient to establish the required positions (HB740_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_).",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "There is no specific appropriation detailed in the measure. The program authorizes allocations from the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund to counties for grants and the purchase of deed restrictions (HB740_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_). Testimony from the City and County of Honolulu highlights significant, unfunded long-term administrative costs for the counties (HB740_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_). These recurring costs include staffing for program administration, compliance monitoring, and enforcement of the perpetual deed restrictions (HB740_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_). Testimony expresses concern that these administrative responsibilities and their associated costs will persist indefinitely, even if program funding is discontinued in the future (HB740_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_). The City indicates it does not have existing capacity and would need to hire or train new staff, or contract out services, to manage the program (HB740_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_). The Department of Taxation estimates no material impact on state revenues over this period from the conveyance tax exemption (HB740_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_). However, the City noted potential impacts to its real property tax revenues (HB740_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_). These factors suggest a potential long-term fiscal burden on county governments that is not yet funded.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The Department of Taxation testified that it anticipates no material revenue impact from the bill's conveyance tax exemption (HB740_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_). Conversely, the City and County of Honolulu expressed concern about potential impacts to real property tax revenues, though no specific figures were provided (HB740_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_). The bill allows counties to generate operating revenue by establishing and collecting fees and premiums to cover administrative costs (HB740_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_).",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "Testimony from the City and County of Honolulu indicates that the perpetual deed restrictions create an ongoing fiscal obligation for counties to monitor and enforce compliance indefinitely (HB740_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_). These administrative and enforcement costs will continue long after the initial six-year period, potentially in perpetuity, even if state funding for the program ceases (HB740_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_). This establishes a long-term, unfunded mandate on county resources (HB740_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_).",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "New testimony has introduced significant concerns not present in the previous analysis. The City and County of Honolulu detailed major operational challenges, including a lack of capacity, staff, and dedicated funding to administer the program, and requested statutory immunity for county personnel (HB740_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_). New policy concerns were also raised regarding the perpetual nature of the deed restrictions and the absence of specific affordability requirements, such as an Area Median Income (AMI) cap (HB740_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_). Finally, the Department of Taxation provided a specific fiscal estimate of no material revenue impact from the conveyance tax exemption (HB740_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_)."
