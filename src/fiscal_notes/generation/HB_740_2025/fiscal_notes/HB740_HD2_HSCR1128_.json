  "overview": "The purpose of this measure is to establish the Accessory Dwelling Unit Financing and Deed Restriction Program to allocate funds to the counties to provide grants to eligible homeowners or homebuyers to finance construction costs, development costs, and non-reoccurring closing costs associated with the construction of an accessory dwelling unit and purchase deed restrictions on the property. [9] This bill would enable the Hawai‘i Housing Finance and Development Corporation (HHFDC) to allocate funds from the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund (DURF) to the counties for the purposes of providing grants to homeowners to support the development of ADUs, and for the counties to purchase and own deed restrictions on eligible properties. [8] The upfront costs of designing and permitting an ADU are barriers for many homeowners. [8]",
  "appropriations": "This measure does not contain a specific appropriation. [9] The bill allocates Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund resources to counties to administer grants and enforce deed restrictions. [8] The bill would enable the Hawai‘i Housing Finance and Development Corporation (HHFDC) to allocate funds from the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund (DURF) to the counties. [8]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The lack of an AMI requirement raises concerns about whether this program will indeed increase the supply of “affordable” housing in the State. [8] The time and skill required to negotiate the price of a deed restriction on a case-by-case basis alone would require extensive costs. [8] Estimates for ADU construction in Hawaii is about $250-$350 per square feet. [8]",
  "agency_impact": "The City and County of Honolulu does not currently have the capacity to administer this program, and the bill’s language is unclear if a portion of the DURF funds provided to the counties could be used for administrative funding purposes. [8] There is no dedicated funding source to establish and stand-up full-time equivalent (FTE) positions to administer, train staff, and enforce the program. [8] The bill creates an immunity for State officers, employees, and agents, however, it leaves out county officers, employees, and agents. [8]",
  "economic_impact": "The average price of a home in Hawai‘i has now surpassed $800,000 (HB740_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_.PDF.txt). [8] According to DBEDT’s 2024 report on Demographic, Social, and Economic Characteristics of Hawai‘i’s Race Grouos, around 62 percent of Native Hawaiians in Hawai‘i are employed, yet they earn significantly less than other major race groups in the state, with medium annual earnings falling below $40,000 (HB740_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_.PDF.txt) for full-time, year-round work. [8] By reducing financial barriers to ADU construction, this bill encourages homeowners to develop additional housing units on their properties. [8]",
  "policy_impact": "This measure establishes the Accessory Dwelling Unit Financing and Deed Restriction Program. [8] The Hawai‘i Association of REALTORS® has concerns that the deed restrictions contained in this measure are in perpetuity. [8] The absence of a restriction on short-term rentals may make this program ripe for abuse. [8]",
  "revenue_sources": "The bill allocates Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund resources to counties to administer grants and enforce deed restrictions. [8] HHFDC supports HB 740 HD2, which establishes the Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) Financing and Deed Restriction Program to allocate funds to the counties. [8] While it also allows the counties to establish and collect fees and premiums to cover these costs, there is no dedicated funding source to establish and stand-up full-time equivalent (FTE) positions. [8]",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The Department of Taxation (DOTAX) estimates no material revenue impact for this bill. [8] The measure has a defective effective date of July 1, 3000. [8] The City and County of Honolulu has concerns about capacity challenges, lack of positions and staff, and potential liability associated with the bill in its current form. [8] There is no dedicated funding source to establish and stand-up full-time equivalent (FTE) positions to administer, train staff, and enforce the program. [8] Annual reporting requirements will continue for the length of recorded deed restrictions, potentially into perpetuity, even if program funding is terminated at some point in the future. [8] If the City was to take on this responsibility, we would need appropriate funding and time to either onboard new staff with the required expertise, train new and existing staff, or contract out to a third-party entity. [8] The time and skill required to negotiate the price of a deed restriction on a case-by-case basis alone would require extensive costs. [8] DOTAX requests that if this bill is passed, section 6 take effect on January 1, 2026, to allow for form and instruction changes necessary to implement the proposed conveyance tax exemption. [8] Purchasing deed restrictions under the program is exempt from the Procurement Code. [8] The deed restrictions contained in this measure are in perpetuity. [8]",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The Department of Taxation (DOTAX) estimates no material revenue impact for this bill. [8] Section 6 of H.B. 740, H.D. 2, amends section 247-3, Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS), to exempt from conveyance tax any property with a county-owned deed restriction. [8] DOTAX requests that if this bill is passed, section 6 take effect on January 1, 2026, to allow for form and instruction changes necessary to implement the proposed conveyance tax exemption. [8]",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The measure allocates funds to the counties to provide grants to eligible homeowners or homebuyers to finance construction costs, development costs, and non-reoccurring closing costs associated with the construction of an accessory dwelling unit. [9] These funds are allocated from the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund to the counties. [8] The grant program will make it possible for more moderate-income homeowners to participate in creating housing solutions. [8]",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "Annual reporting requirements will continue for the length of recorded deed restrictions, potentially into perpetuity, even if program funding is terminated at some point in the future. [8] Having deed restrictions on a property in perpetuity can be problematic especially in land use planning, as communities can change and uses for a property may need to change as well over time. [8] The perpetual deed restrictions ensure that these housing units will remain available for local workers and residents for generations to come. [8]",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "A significant update from the previous fiscal note, which projected an indeterminate loss of revenue, is that the Department of Taxation (DOTAX) now estimates no material revenue impact for this bill. [8] New testimony from the City and County of Honolulu highlights major agency impacts, stating it does not currently have the capacity to administer this program and citing a lack of dedicated funding for FTE positions, training, and enforcement. [8] [8] Additional economic context is provided, with testimony noting the average home price in Hawai‘i has now surpassed $800,000 (HB740_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_.PDF.txt) and that Native Hawaiian median annual earnings fall below $40,000 (HB740_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_.PDF.txt). [8] [8] Stakeholders have raised new policy concerns, including that deed restrictions are in perpetuity and that the program lacks specific affordability requirements. [8] [8]"
