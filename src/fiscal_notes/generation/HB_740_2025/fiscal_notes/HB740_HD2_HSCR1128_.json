  "overview": "This measure establishes the Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) Financing and Deed Restriction Program to allocate funds to the counties to provide grants to eligible homeowners or homebuyers. [8] The Hawai‘i Housing Finance and Development Corporation (HHFDC) supports the program as a way to increase the inventory of rental units in the State. [8] The purpose of this measure is to establish the Accessory Dwelling Unit Financing and Deed Restriction Program to finance construction costs, development costs, and non-reoccurring closing costs and purchase deed restrictions on the property.

  "agency_impact": "The City and County of Honolulu's Office of Housing has concerns about capacity challenges, lack of positions and staff, potential impacts to real property tax revenues, eligibility criteria, implementation timelines, enforceability, and potential liability. [8] The City and County of Honolulu does not currently have the capacity to administer this program, and the bill’s language is unclear if a portion of the DURF funds provided to the counties could be used for administrative funding purposes. [8] The bill creates an immunity for State officers, employees, and agents, but it leaves out county officers, employees, and agents who would be administering the program. [8]",
  "economic_impact": "The average price of a home in Hawai‘i has now surpassed $800,000 (HB740_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_.PDF.txt). [8] According to a DBEDT report, Native Hawaiians in Hawai‘i have medium annual earnings falling below $40,000 (HB740_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_.PDF.txt) for full-time, year-round work. [8] Between July 2022 and July 2023 alone, an average of twelve people left Hawai‘i every day. [8]",
  "policy_impact": "The Hawai‘i Association of REALTORS® has concerns that the deed restrictions contained in this measure are in perpetuity, which can be problematic in land use planning as communities change over time. [8] They suggest that the deed restrictions be amortized over 10 years but are open to other proposals for alternative timeframes. [8] The Office of Housing raises concerns about the lack of an AMI requirement and the absence of a restriction on short-term rentals, which may make the program ripe for abuse. [8]",
  "revenue_sources": "This bill would enable the Hawai‘i Housing Finance and Development Corporation (HHFDC) to allocate funds from the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund (DURF) to the counties. [8] The Department of Taxation (DOTAX) estimates no material revenue impact for this bill. [8] The City and County of Honolulu notes that the bill’s language is unclear if a portion of the DURF funds could be used for administrative funding purposes. [8]",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The City and County of Honolulu has concerns that there is no dedicated funding source to establish and stand-up full-time equivalent (FTE) positions to administer, train staff, and enforce the program. [8] The annual reporting requirements will continue for the length of recorded deed restrictions, potentially into perpetuity, even if program funding is terminated at some point in the future. [8] If the City was to take on the responsibility of purchasing and owning deed restrictions, it would need appropriate funding and time to either onboard new staff, train existing staff, or contract out to a third-party entity. [8] The time and skill required to negotiate the price of a deed restriction on a case-by-case basis alone would require extensive costs. [8]",

  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The bill requires counties to meet annual reporting requirements that will continue for the length of recorded deed restrictions, potentially into perpetuity. [8] These requirements would continue even if program funding is terminated at some point in the future. [8]",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "New testimony from the City and County of Honolulu raises significant concerns regarding its capacity to administer the program, citing a lack of positions, staff, and a dedicated funding source for FTE positions. [8] The City also notes that county officers and employees are not provided the same statutory immunity as state personnel under the bill. [8] The Hawai‘i Association of REALTORS® introduced new policy concerns, suggesting that the perpetual deed restrictions be amortized over a set timeframe instead. [8]"
