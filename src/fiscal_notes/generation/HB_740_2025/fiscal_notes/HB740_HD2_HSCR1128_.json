  "overview": "",
  "appropriations": "This measure authorizes the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation to allocate an unspecified amount of funds from the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund (DURF) to the counties. These funds are designated for providing grants to homeowners for Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) construction and for the counties to purchase the associated deed restrictions. The specific appropriation amount to be transferred from the DURF is not defined in the provided documents.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "While the program establishes a grant structure, testimony highlights concerns that the methodology lacks specific eligibility criteria, such as an Area Median Income (AMI) requirement for occupants. The City and County of Honolulu noted that the criteria for evaluating a homeowner's capability to properly use the grant are not established. This ambiguity could lead to inconsistent implementation and raises questions about whether the program will effectively target affordable housing needs.",
  "agency_impact": "The City and County of Honolulu testified that it currently lacks the capacity, staffing, and administrative funding to implement the program. It is unclear if allocations from the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund can be used for the counties' administrative costs, which would require significant time and resources to establish. Furthermore, the bill provides legal immunity for state officers and employees but does not extend the same protection to the county personnel responsible for administering the program.",
  "economic_impact": "The program aims to address significant economic pressures, with ADU construction costs estimated at $250-$350 per square foot and 56% of Hawai'i households being rent-burdened. By financing ADU construction, the measure intends to increase the supply of lower-cost rental units and create a dedicated housing stock for the local workforce. This could help retain residents who might otherwise leave the state due to the high cost of housing, where the median home price exceeds $800,000.",
  "policy_impact": "Testimony raised the policy concern that the deed restrictions are established in perpetuity, which the Hawai‘i Association of REALTORS® argued could negatively impact future land use planning. Additionally, the lack of a restriction on short-term rentals or an Area Median Income (AMI) requirement for tenants was highlighted as a potential loophole. These omissions could undermine the primary policy goal of creating a permanent stock of genuinely affordable housing for the local workforce.",
  "revenue_sources": "The primary funding source identified for the grants and deed restriction purchases is the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund (DURF), as allocated by the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation. The measure also authorizes counties to establish and collect fees and premiums to cover their administrative and enforcement costs. A conveyance tax exemption for properties under the program is included, which the Department of Taxation estimates will have no material revenue impact.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The primary fiscal implication is the allocation of an unspecified amount from the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund to counties for program grants. The Department of Taxation anticipates no material revenue loss from the new conveyance tax exemption but requests a delayed effective date of January 1, 2026, for implementation. A significant long-term fiscal concern is the potential unfunded mandate on counties, which are responsible for program administration and enforcement of perpetual deed restrictions. These duties would likely require new, permanent full-time equivalent positions and associated administrative funding that may not be covered by state allocations. If state funding ceases, counties would still be liable for enforcing the deed restrictions indefinitely. The City and County of Honolulu also noted potential negative impacts on its real property tax revenues. These unquantified, ongoing county-level operational costs represent the most significant fiscal implication over the six-year period and beyond.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The Department of Taxation has estimated that the new conveyance tax exemption will have no material impact on state revenues. Conversely, the City and County of Honolulu raised concerns about potential negative impacts to its real property tax revenues. The measure does allow counties to generate new operating revenue by establishing and collecting fees and premiums to help offset their administrative costs.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "There are no direct state capital expenditures identified in the measure. The program's funding is allocated for grants to private homeowners to finance their construction costs rather than for the development of state-owned facilities or infrastructure.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The fiscal obligations for counties under this program are expected to be permanent due to the perpetual nature of the deed restrictions. Counties will be required to fund ongoing administration, monitoring, and enforcement costs indefinitely for every participating property. This creates a long-term, unfunded liability for county governments that will persist even if state allocations from the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund are discontinued.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "New information has emerged regarding the program's implementation and fiscal impact, particularly at the county level. The Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund (DURF) has been identified as the specific funding source. The City and County of Honolulu has raised significant concerns about its lack of capacity, administrative funding, and legal indemnification to run the program, creating a potential unfunded mandate. While the Department of Taxation now estimates no material revenue impact from the conveyance tax exemption, new policy concerns have been raised regarding the perpetual nature of deed restrictions and the absence of specific affordability criteria, such as AMI requirements."
