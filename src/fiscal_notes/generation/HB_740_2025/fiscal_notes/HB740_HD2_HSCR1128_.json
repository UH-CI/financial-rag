  "overview": "",
  "appropriations": "",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "Concerns have been raised regarding the lack of specific criteria for evaluating an applicant's capability to properly use the grant, leaving this determination to individual counties. This ambiguity could lead to implementation delays and inconsistent policies across the state. The assumptions for program rollout and administrative workload are therefore subject to variation depending on county-level rulemaking.",
  "agency_impact": "The City and County of Honolulu has expressed significant concerns about its capacity to administer the program, citing a lack of dedicated staff, positions, and administrative funding. It is unclear if Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund allocations can be used for administrative costs. Additionally, counties lack experience in purchasing and owning deed restrictions, and the measure does not provide statutory immunity for county officers and employees as it does for state personnel, creating potential liability.",
  "economic_impact": "Numerous testimonies from business and community organizations indicate the program is expected to positively impact the economy by increasing the housing stock available to the local workforce. This retention of skilled employees is anticipated to support local businesses across various sectors and contribute to overall economic stability. The program is viewed as a key tool to prevent the outmigration of residents, which is currently a significant drain on the state's workforce.",
  "policy_impact": "New policy concerns have been raised regarding the perpetual nature of the deed restrictions, with suggestions to consider a time-limited amortization period instead. Furthermore, the program lacks specific affordability requirements, such as Area Median Income (AMI) limits or rent caps, leading to questions about whether the new units will be genuinely affordable for the target workforce. The absence of an explicit restriction on using the units as short-term rentals has also been identified as a potential loophole.",
  "revenue_sources": "The Department of Taxation has updated its assessment to project no material revenue impact from the conveyance tax exemption, a revision from the previously anticipated minor negative impact. A new concern has been introduced regarding potential unforeseen negative impacts on county-level real property tax revenues. The Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund remains the sole funding source, with no mechanism for replenishment through this program.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The Department of Taxation now anticipates no material impact on state operating revenues from the conveyance tax exemption. However, the City and County of Honolulu has raised new concerns about potential impacts on its real property tax revenues. The bill's defective effective date of July 1, 3000, must be amended for any revenue changes to be realized.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "Significant new concerns have been raised by the counties regarding administrative capacity, lack of dedicated funding for program management, and potential legal liability. The policy discussion now includes criticism of the perpetual nature of the deed restrictions and the absence of explicit affordability metrics like AMI limits. The projected revenue impact from the conveyance tax exemption has been revised by the Department of Taxation to be immaterial."
