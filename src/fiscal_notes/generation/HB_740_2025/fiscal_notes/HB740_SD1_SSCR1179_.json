  "overview": "The purpose of this Act is to establish an accessory dwelling unit financing and deed restriction program under the Hawaii housing finance and development corporation. [11] This measure establishes the Accessory Dwelling Unit Financing and Deed Restriction Program to allocate funds to the counties for the purchase of equity from eligible homeowners or homebuyers to finance construction costs, development costs, and non‑reoccurring closing costs associated with the construction of an accessory dwelling unit and purchase deed restrictions on the property. [11] [12] The program sunsets on January 1, 2031, and requires the Hawaii housing finance and development corporation to submit a report of its evaluation to the legislature. [11] [11]",
  "appropriations": "The corporation shall not allocate more than $2,000,000.00 (HB740_SD1_.HTM.txt) per year for the program between all counties. [12] [11] Funds are allocated from the rental housing revolving fund to counties to purchase equity from eligible homeowners or homebuyers to finance construction costs, development costs, and non‑reoccurring closing costs associated with the construction of accessory dwelling units. [11] [11] A county may use up to an unspecified per cent of allocated funds for administrative costs. [11]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The Accessory Dwelling Unit Financing and Deed Restriction Program was changed from a grant program to an equity purchase program. [12] A homeowner participating in the purchase of equity established pursuant to this subpart shall repay the corporation its prorated share of the appraised value of the completed accessory dwelling unit, with appreciation, within fifteen years or upon sale or transfer of the property, whichever occurs first. [11] The total contribution amount from a county distributed per accessory dwelling unit shall not exceed eight per cent of the appraised value of the property. [11]",
  "agency_impact": "The Hawaii housing finance and development corporation (HHFDC) may allocate funds from the rental housing revolving fund to a county and may adopt rules pursuant to chapter 91 for the purposes of this subpart. [11] [11] Counties shall be responsible for validating the evidence and ensuring compliance with this subpart and may contract with non-government persons or entities to ensure compliance. [11] The City and County of Honolulu noted existing challenges to implement this measure in its current form with regard to capacity, lack of positions and staff, potential impacts to real property tax revenues, eligibility criteria, implementation timelines, enforceability, and potential liability. [12]",
  "economic_impact": "Incentivizing the construction of ADUs through the deed restriction program established by this measure could help increase housing stock that aligns with specific community needs. [12] The deed restriction program will create an inventory of homes for local residents, stabilize home prices, and reduce speculation in our housing market. [10] This measure will prevent the conversion of the units into vacation rentals or investment properties and reducing speculation in the State's housing market. [12]",
  "policy_impact": "This measure changes the source of funding from the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund to the Rental Housing Revolving Fund and changes the program from a grant program to an equity purchase program. [12] The bill amends section 247-3, Hawaii Revised Statutes, to allow a conveyance tax exemption for any conveyance of real property with a county owned deed restriction under this program. [10] [11] The deed restriction shall be recorded against the property and shall run with the land in perpetuity, binding all future owners, successors, and assigns. [11]",
  "revenue_sources": "The source of funding for the program is from the Rental Housing Revolving Fund. [12] If a property with a deed restriction is sold to a nonresident, the corporation shall be entitled to fifty per cent of appreciation at the time of sale, to be collected by the corporation and placed in the rental housing revolving fund. [11] [11] A homeowner participating in the purchase of equity program shall repay HHFDC its prorated share of the appraised value of the completed accessory dwelling unit, with appreciation, within fifteen years or upon sale or transfer of the property, whichever occurs first. [12]",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The corporation shall not allocate more than $2,000,000.00 (HB740_SD1_.HTM.txt) per year under this subpart. [11] This Act shall be repealed on January 1, 2031. [11] A homeowner participating in the purchase of equity program must repay HHFDC its prorated share of the appraised value of the completed accessory dwelling unit, with appreciation, within fifteen years or upon sale or transfer of the property, whichever occurs first. [12] If a county does not expend moneys allocated pursuant to this section within one year of receipt, the moneys shall be returned to the corporation and placed in the rental housing revolving fund. [11] [11] The counties are authorized to use an unspecified percentage of awarded funds for administrative costs. [12] The owner of the property shall submit a written statement with accompanying evidence to the county verifying the property was occupied by a qualified owner-occupant or tenant during all of the prior calendar year. [11] This creates an ongoing administrative responsibility for counties. [10] The exemption to the Conveyance Tax shall apply to taxable years beginning January 1, 2026. [12] The bill has an effective date of July 1, 2050, to encourage further discussion. [12]",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "If a property with a deed restriction in place pursuant to this subpart is sold to a nonresident, the corporation is entitled to fifty per cent of appreciation at the time of sale, which is to be collected by the corporation and placed in the rental housing revolving fund. [11] [11] A homeowner participating in the equity program shall repay the corporation its prorated share of the appraised value of the completed accessory dwelling unit, with appreciation, within fifteen years or upon sale or transfer of the property. [11] The bill also exempts from conveyance tax any property with a county-owned deed restriction. [11]",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The corporation may allocate funds from the rental housing revolving fund to a county to purchase equity from eligible homeowners or homebuyers. [11] [11] These funds are intended to finance construction costs, development costs, and non‑reoccurring closing costs associated with the construction of accessory dwelling units. [11] The total contribution amount from a county distributed per accessory dwelling unit shall not exceed eight per cent of the appraised value of the property. [11]",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The program is set to sunset on January 1, 2031. [11] A deed restriction shall be recorded against the property and shall run with the land in perpetuity, binding all future owners, successors, and assigns. [11] This creates a perpetual compliance and enforcement responsibility for counties, which will continue after program funding is terminated. [10]",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The program has been significantly amended from a grant program to an equity purchase program. [12] The funding source was changed from the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund to the Rental Housing Revolving Fund. [12] A specific annual funding limit has been established, specifying that HHFDC shall not allocate more than $2,000,000.00 (HB740_SD1_.HTM.txt) per year for the program between all counties. [12] A repayment clause has been added, requiring a homeowner participating in the equity program to repay HHFDC its prorated share of the appraised value with appreciation within fifteen years or upon sale. [12] A sunset date of January 1, 2031 has been inserted, and a legislative report on the program is now required. [11] [12] Unlike the previous version, the bill now expands the indemnification agreement to include counties and their employees and requires prioritization for government employees as tenants and homeowners. [12] [12]"
