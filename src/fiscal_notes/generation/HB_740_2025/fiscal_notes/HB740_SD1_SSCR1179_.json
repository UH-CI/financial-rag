  "overview": "The measure has been amended to change the Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) Financing and Deed Restriction Program from a grant-based initiative to an equity purchase program. A sunset date of December 31, 2030, has been established, effectively making it a pilot program. Additionally, the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation (HHFDC) is now required to submit an evaluation report to the Legislature by the 2031 Regular Session.",
  "appropriations": "The funding source for the program has been changed from the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund to the Rental Housing Revolving Fund. A statewide annual appropriation cap of $2,000,000 is now specified for the program. The state's financial contribution is limited to eight percent of the property's appraised value per ADU.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal model has fundamentally shifted from a grant expenditure to a recoverable equity purchase. A new provision requires homeowners to repay HHFDC's prorated share of the appraised value, including appreciation, within fifteen years or upon sale or transfer of the property. This introduces a long-term revenue recovery assumption, where initial outlays are considered investments rather than permanent costs.",
  "agency_impact": "To address previously stated county concerns, the measure now explicitly authorizes counties to use an unspecified percentage of awarded funds for administrative costs. The bill also expands the indemnification agreement to include counties and their officers, agents, and employees, thereby mitigating previously identified liability risks.",
  "economic_impact": "The program's economic model has been revised to an equity purchase structure, enabling the State to recover its investment along with a share of the property's appreciation. This creates a revolving fund mechanism that can finance additional ADUs in the future, maximizing the long-term impact of the initial state investment. The program now also prioritizes government employees as homeowners or tenants.",
  "policy_impact": "The program's structure is significantly altered from a grant to an equity purchase model, with a new sunset date of December 31, 2030. Eligibility criteria have been narrowed, requiring that homeowners or homebuyers own no other real property. A new provision prioritizes government employees for participation in the program.",
  "revenue_sources": "The funding source has been changed to the Rental Housing Revolving Fund. A new, long-term revenue stream for the state is created through the mandatory repayment of the equity purchase plus appreciation. The conveyance tax exemption for participating properties is now clarified to apply to taxable years beginning January 1, 2026.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The program is now defined with a sunset date of December 31, 2030, and a maximum annual expenditure of $2,000,000 from the Rental Housing Revolving Fund. The conversion to an equity purchase model with a 15-year repayment term means initial outlays are investments rather than grants. While no revenue from repayments is anticipated within the first six years, this structure establishes a framework for future revenue recovery to replenish the fund. An HHFDC evaluation report is required before the 2031 legislative session to inform any potential re-authorization of the program.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "A long-term positive impact on state operating revenue is now anticipated due to the equity purchase repayment requirement. The state will recover its principal investment plus a share of the property's appreciation within a 15-year period or upon sale, though this revenue stream will materialize after the initial six years. The effective date for the conveyance tax exemption is now set for January 1, 2026.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The program is now scheduled to sunset on December 31, 2030, which will cease new expenditures. However, a long-term fiscal obligation for the state will be to manage the incoming revenue from repayments as the 15-year terms conclude or properties are sold. This creates a self-replenishing funding mechanism for the Rental Housing Revolving Fund if the program is re-authorized in the future.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The program has been fundamentally restructured from a grant initiative to a repayable equity purchase program, with funding now sourced from the Rental Housing Revolving Fund under a $2,000,000 annual cap. Key changes include the addition of a 2030 sunset date, prioritization of government employees, extension of liability protection to counties, and authorization for counties to use funds for administrative costs. A long-term revenue recovery mechanism for the state has been created through the mandatory repayment of the equity investment with appreciation."
