  "overview": "The measure has been substantially amended, changing the program's structure from a grant system to an equity purchase program (HB740_SD1_SSCR1179_). The funding source has been shifted from the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund to the Rental Housing Revolving Fund (HB740_SD1_SSCR1179_). The program is now established as a pilot with a sunset date of December 31, 2030, and includes a requirement for the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation (HHFDC) to submit an evaluation report to the Legislature in 2031 (HB740_SD1_SSCR1179_).",
  "appropriations": "The Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation (HHFDC) is authorized to allocate funds from the Rental Housing Revolving Fund, with a maximum total allocation of $2,000,000 (HB740_SD1_SSCR1179_) per year across all counties. The total contribution from a county per accessory dwelling unit may not exceed eight percent of the property's appraised value (HB740_SD1_SSCR1179_). Additionally, counties are now authorized to use an unspecified percentage of these funds for administrative costs (HB740_SD1_SSCR1179_).",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal model has fundamentally changed from a grant program to a recoverable state investment. The new methodology assumes that the state's investment will be recouped, as homeowners are required to repay HHFDC its prorated share of the appraised value of the ADU, including appreciation (HB740_SD1_SSCR1179_). This repayment must occur within fifteen years or upon the sale or transfer of the property (HB740_SD1_SSCR1179_).",
  "agency_impact": "In response to testimony, the measure now addresses key county-level agency concerns by authorizing counties to use a portion of awarded funds for administrative costs (HB740_SD1_SSCR1179_). Furthermore, the required indemnification agreement has been expanded to explicitly include counties and their officers, agents, and employees, mitigating potential liability (HB740_SD1_SSCR1179_). The program also now requires HHFDC to submit a comprehensive evaluation report to the Legislature by the 2031 Regular Session (HB740_SD1_SSCR1179_).",
  "economic_impact": "The program is now structured as an equity purchase program, where the state shares in the capital gain of the units, rather than a grant program (HB740_SD1_SSCR1179_). This change allows the state to recover its investment with appreciation, potentially enabling the funds to support more housing units in the future (HB740_SD1_SSCR1179_). The program is now also required to prioritize homeowners, homebuyers, and prospective tenants who are government employees (HB740_SD1_SSCR1179_).",
  "policy_impact": "The policy of perpetual deed restrictions has been replaced with a sunset date of December 31, 2030, and a fifteen-year repayment requirement for participants (HB740_SD1_SSCR1179_). New eligibility criteria have been introduced, restricting the program to homeowners or homebuyers who own no other real property and prioritizing government employees (HB740_SD1_SSCR1179_). The conveyance tax exemption has been clarified to apply to taxable years beginning January 1, 2026 (HB740_SD1_SSCR1179_).",
  "revenue_sources": "The funding source for the program has been changed from the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund to the Rental Housing Revolving Fund (HB740_SD1_SSCR1179_). HHFDC is authorized to allocate up to $2,000,000 (HB740_SD1_SSCR1179_) annually from this fund. The program is designed to generate return revenue to the fund through the repayment of the state's equity share, with appreciation, from participating homeowners (HB740_SD1_SSCR1179_).",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The program's fiscal outlook is now defined by a sunset date of December 31, 2030 (HB740_SD1_SSCR1179_). Annual allocations from the Rental Housing Revolving Fund are capped at $2,000,000 (HB740_SD1_SSCR1179_). Unlike the previous version, this measure provides a mechanism for the state to recover its investment. Participating homeowners must repay HHFDC its prorated share of the ADU's appraised value, plus appreciation, within fifteen years or upon sale, whichever is first (HB740_SD1_SSCR1179_). This repayment structure suggests a revolving-like effect, where funds will return to the state for future use, although these returns will begin to materialize toward the end of or after the initial six-year period. Concerns about unfunded county administrative mandates have been addressed by authorizing counties to use a percentage of the allocated funds for these costs (HB740_SD1_SSCR1179_). The conveyance tax exemption is now scheduled to begin on January 1, 2026 (HB740_SD1_SSCR1179_). HHFDC is required to submit a report evaluating the program's performance to the Legislature before the 2031 session, informing future fiscal decisions (HB740_SD1_SSCR1179_).",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The measure now creates a new potential revenue stream for the state's Rental Housing Revolving Fund through the repayment of equity investments (HB740_SD1_SSCR1179_). Participating homeowners must repay HHFDC's prorated share of the completed ADU's value, with appreciation, creating a return on the state's initial outlay (HB740_SD1_SSCR1179_). The effective date for the conveyance tax exemption, which will reduce state revenue, has been clarified to begin on January 1, 2026 (HB740_SD1_SSCR1179_).",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The program is scheduled to sunset on December 31, 2030, ending new allocations (HB740_SD1_SSCR1179_). However, fiscal activity will continue as homeowners who participated in the program will be required to repay the state's equity investment within fifteen years of participation (HB740_SD1_SSCR1179_). Therefore, the state will continue to receive revenue from repayments, with appreciation, well after the program's sunset date.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The measure has been significantly amended, converting the program from a grant system with perpetual deed restrictions to an equity purchase program with a sunset date of December 31, 2030 (HB740_SD1_SSCR1179_). The funding source was changed to the Rental Housing Revolving Fund, with a new annual cap of $2,000,000 (HB740_SD1_SSCR1179_). Key county concerns were addressed by adding a provision for administrative costs and expanding indemnification to county personnel (HB740_SD1_SSCR1179_). A fifteen-year repayment requirement for homeowners was established, allowing the state to recover its investment with appreciation (HB740_SD1_SSCR1179_). New eligibility criteria now restrict the program to owners of no other real property and prioritize government employees (HB740_SD1_SSCR1179_)."
