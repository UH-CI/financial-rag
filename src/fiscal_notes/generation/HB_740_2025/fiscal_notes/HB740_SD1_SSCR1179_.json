  "overview": "This measure has been amended to change the Accessory Dwelling Unit Financing and Deed Restriction Program from a grant program to an equity purchase program. [12] The purpose of this Act is to establish an accessory dwelling unit financing and deed restriction program to promote the development of additional housing while securing that housing for local residents working in Hawaii. [11] This Act shall be repealed on January 1, 2031. [11]",
  "appropriations": "The corporation shall not allocate more than $2,000,000 (HB740_SD1_.HTM.txt) per year under this subpart. [11] The committee hearing specifies that HHFDC shall not allocate more than $2,000,000 (HB740_SD1_SSCR1179_.htm.txt) per year for the program between all counties. [12] The counties are authorized to use an unspecified percentage of awarded funds for administrative costs. [12]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The Committee notes that loans or other forms of investment, rather than a grant program, would allow the State to recover on its investment, thereby enabling the State to finance additional ADUs in the future. [12] The Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund Equity Program is an example that enables the State to share in the capital gain of units receiving state funds. [12] [12] It is suggested that other ways for the State to unlock the value of its investment and maximize future housing construction should be explored. [12]",
  "agency_impact": "The terms of the required indemnification agreement have been expanded to include the counties and county officers, agents, and employees, addressing a previous concern about liability. [12] The Hawaii housing finance and development corporation is required to submit a report of its evaluation of the program to the legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the regular session of 2031. [11]",
  "economic_impact": "",
  "policy_impact": "The program has been changed from a grant program to an equity purchase program. [12] A new provision requires a homeowner participating in the purchase of equity program to repay the corporation its prorated share of the appraised value of the completed accessory dwelling unit, with appreciation, within fifteen years or upon sale or transfer of the property, whichever occurs first. [12] [12] The amended measure inserts language to require the program to prioritize homeowners or homebuyers and prospective tenants that are government employees. [12]",
  "revenue_sources": "The source of funding for the program has been changed from the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund to the Rental Housing Revolving Fund. [12] Moneys in the Rental Housing Revolving fund shall be used for the administration and purchase of deed restrictions as part of the accessory dwelling unit financing and deed restriction program. [11] If a county does not expend moneys allocated pursuant to this section within one year of receipt, the moneys shall be returned to the corporation and placed in the rental housing revolving fund. [11] [11]",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation (HHFDC) shall not allocate more than $2,000,000 (HB740_SD1_.HTM.txt) per year for the program between all counties. [11] [12] A homeowner participating in the program shall repay the corporation its prorated share of the appraised value of the completed accessory dwelling unit, with appreciation, within fifteen years or upon sale or transfer of the property, whichever occurs first. [11] [11] If a property with a deed restriction is sold to a nonresident, the corporation may bring action against the homeowner and shall be entitled to fifty per cent of appreciation at the time of sale, to be collected and placed in the rental housing revolving fund. [11] [11] The program is scheduled to sunset on January 1, 2031. [11]",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The State may realize operating revenue from a new repayment clause that requires a homeowner to repay the corporation its prorated share of the appraised value with appreciation within fifteen years or upon sale or transfer. [11] Additionally, if a property is sold to a nonresident, the corporation is entitled to fifty per cent of appreciation at the time of sale, which is to be collected by the corporation and placed in the rental housing revolving fund. [11] [11]",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "This Act is repealed on January 1, 2031, which sunsets the program and its associated fiscal obligations. [11] However, any deed restriction recorded against a property under the program shall run with the land in perpetuity, binding all future owners, successors, and assigns. [11] [11]",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The program has been fundamentally changed from a grant program to an equity purchase program, with a new requirement for homeowners to repay the State's investment with appreciation within fifteen years or upon sale. [12] [12] The funding source has been switched from the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund to the Rental Housing Revolving Fund, and an annual allocation cap of $2,000,000 (HB740_SD1_SSCR1179_.htm.txt) is now specified. [12] [12] A key concern from the previous note regarding liability for county employees has been addressed by expanding the indemnification agreement to include county personnel. [12] The program is now set to sunset on January 1, 2031. [11]"
