{
  "overview": "The measure has been amended, changing the Accessory Dwelling Unit Financing and Deed Restriction Program from a grant program to an equity purchase program (HB740_SD1_.HTM.txt). The purpose is still to finance the construction of accessory dwelling units, but the mechanism for state investment has shifted. The program is now set to sunset on December 31, 2030 (HB740_SD1_.HTM.txt).",
  "appropriations": "The source of funding for the program has been changed from the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund to the Rental Housing Revolving Fund (HB740_SD1_.HTM.txt). The Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation (HHFDC) shall not allocate more than $2,000,000 (HB740_SD1_.HTM.txt) per year for the program between all counties. The measure now authorizes the counties to use an unspecified percentage of awarded funds for administrative costs (HB740_SD1_.HTM.txt).",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The methodology has been changed from a grant to an equity purchase model, which allows \"the State to recover on its investment\" (HB740_SD1_.HTM.txt). A homeowner participating in the program is required to repay HHFDC its prorated share of the appraised value of the completed ADU, with appreciation, within fifteen years or upon sale, whichever occurs first (HB740_SD1_.HTM.txt). The total contribution amount from a county per ADU shall not exceed eight percent of the appraised value of the property (HB740_SD1_.HTM.txt).",
  "agency_impact": "In response to concerns about county liability, the measure was amended to expand the terms of the required indemnification agreement to include the counties and county officers, agents, and employees (HB740_SD1_.HTM.txt). To address the Department of Taxation's request, the exemption to the Conveyance Tax has been clarified to apply to taxable years beginning January 1, 2026 (HB740_SD1_.HTM.txt). HHFDC is now required to submit a report to the Legislature evaluating the program prior to the Regular Session of 2031 (HB740_SD1_.HTM.txt).",
  "economic_impact": "By changing the program to an equity purchase model with a repayment requirement, the state will be able to recover its investment, \"thereby enabling the State to finance additional ADUs in the future\" (HB740_SD1_.HTM.txt). This shift creates a mechanism to recycle funds and maximize future housing construction with the same initial investment. The program is now also required to prioritize homeowners or homebuyers and prospective tenants that are government employees (HB740_SD1_.HTM.txt).",
  "policy_impact": "The measure has been substantially amended, changing the program from a grant to an equity purchase program and shifting the funding source to the Rental Housing Revolving Fund (HB740_SD1_.HTM.txt). A sunset date of December 31, 2030, has been added, and the effective date has been changed to July 1, 2050, to encourage further discussion (HB740_SD1_.HTM.txt). The indemnification agreement has been expanded to protect county employees, addressing a key concern from prior testimony (HB740_SD1_.HTM.txt).",
  "revenue_sources": "The funding source for the program has been changed to the Rental Housing Revolving Fund (HB740_SD1_.HTM.txt). A significant change is the creation of a revenue stream back to the state; under the new equity purchase model, a homeowner must repay HHFDC its prorated share of the property's appraised value, with appreciation, within fifteen years or upon sale (HB740_SD1_.HTM.txt). This allows the state to \"share in the capital gain of units receiving state funds\" (HB740_SD1_.HTM.txt).",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The six-year outlook for the program is now more defined due to recent amendments. The program has a funding cap where the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation (HHFDC) shall not allocate more than $2,000,000 (HB740_SD1_.HTM.txt) per year among all counties. A sunset date of December 31, 2030, has been established, limiting the program's duration and future fiscal commitments (HB740_SD1_.HTM.txt). A new requirement for homeowners to repay the state's investment within fifteen years or upon sale means that funds expended during the program's operation are expected to be recovered over the long term (HB740_SD1_.HTM.txt). The measure now requires HHFDC to submit a report evaluating the program to the Legislature before the 2031 regular session, which will inform future fiscal decisions (HB740_SD1_.HTM.txt). The concern about perpetual deed restrictions has been addressed by the sunset provision.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The change from a grant to an equity purchase program introduces a new source of operating revenue for the state. The state will now recover its investment and a \"prorated share of the appraised value of the completed accessory dwelling unit, with appreciation\" (HB740_SD1_.HTM.txt). This repayment, due within fifteen years or upon sale of the property, will return funds to the state, unlike the previous grant-based proposal (HB740_SD1_.HTM.txt).",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The state's capital outlay is now structured as a recoverable investment rather than a one-time grant. The total annual capital expenditure for the program is capped, as HHFDC shall not allocate more than $2,000,000 (HB740_SD1_.HTM.txt) per year. The nature of the expenditure is an equity purchase that will be repaid to the state with appreciation over time (HB740_SD1_.HTM.txt).",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The fiscal implications after six years are significantly altered by the introduction of a sunset date of December 31, 2030, which ends the program (HB740_SD1_.HTM.txt). Instead of perpetual administrative duties, the primary fiscal activity will be the collection of repayments from homeowners, which must occur within fifteen years of the investment or upon property sale (HB740_SD1_.HTM.txt). This creates an ongoing revenue stream for the state that extends beyond the program's operational period.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "This measure has been significantly amended, changing the funding mechanism from a grant to an equity purchase program, which allows the state to recover its investment with appreciation. The funding source has been switched from the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund to the Rental Housing Revolving Fund, with an annual allocation cap of $2,000,000 (HB740_SD1_.HTM.txt). Key concerns from previous testimony have been addressed by adding a program sunset date of December 31, 2030, and expanding the indemnification agreement to include county officers and employees (HB740_SD1_.HTM.txt)."
