  "overview": "The program has been fundamentally changed from a grant-based model to an equity purchase program, establishing it as a pilot initiative. It now includes a sunset clause effective December 31, 2030, and a requirement for the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation (HHFDC) to submit a final evaluation report. This reframes the measure as a temporary, evaluative effort rather than a permanent new program.",
  "appropriations": "Funding has been redirected from the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund to the Rental Housing Revolving Fund, with a newly specified annual cap of $2,000,000 for all counties combined. The assistance is now structured as an equity purchase, with a county's contribution per property limited to 8% of its appraised value. Counties are now explicitly authorized to use a portion of these funds to cover administrative costs.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The financial model has been revised from a non-recoverable grant to a recoverable equity purchase, requiring homeowners to repay the State's prorated share with appreciation within fifteen years or upon property sale. New eligibility criteria have been introduced, restricting participation to homeowners who own no other real property. The program also now prioritizes government employees as both homeowners and prospective tenants.",
  "agency_impact": "Key county-level concerns have been addressed by expanding the indemnification agreement to include county officers and employees, reducing their potential liability. Additionally, counties are now explicitly permitted to use a percentage of the allocated state funds for administrative costs, partially mitigating the risk of an unfunded mandate. HHFDC has the new responsibility of preparing a comprehensive program evaluation report for the Legislature by 2031.",
  "economic_impact": "The conversion to an equity purchase model introduces a mechanism for the State to recover its investment with appreciation, allowing the funds to be potentially recycled for future housing initiatives. The program's economic impact is now concentrated within a defined period due to its sunset on December 31, 2030. A new focus on prioritizing government employees aims to support public sector workforce retention.",
  "policy_impact": "The introduction of a sunset date of December 31, 2030, transforms the measure into a pilot program, resolving previous concerns about the perpetual nature of deed restrictions and their long-term impact on land use planning. New eligibility criteria have been added to narrow the program's scope, including a requirement that homeowners own no other real property and a prioritization for government employees. The shift from grants to a recoverable equity purchase aligns state investment with a model that seeks to replenish public funds.",
  "revenue_sources": "The designated funding source has been changed from the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund to the Rental Housing Revolving Fund. A significant change is the creation of a future revenue stream for the state, as the equity purchase model requires homeowners to repay the state's initial investment along with a share of the property's appreciation. This reframes the program from a simple state expenditure to a recoverable investment.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The fiscal outlook is now significantly more defined and contained due to new programmatic caps and a sunset date. HHFDC's annual allocation is capped at $2,000,000 from the Rental Housing Revolving Fund for the duration of the program, which sunsets on December 31, 2030. The program is structured as an equity purchase, requiring homeowners to repay the state's investment with appreciation within 15 years or at the time of sale, creating a mechanism for the state to recover its funds. The perpetual nature of the county's administrative burden is eliminated by the sunset clause, though enforcement of deed restrictions for participating properties will still be required. The authorization for counties to use a portion of funds for administrative costs provides a partial funding stream for their operational expenses during the program's life. HHFDC is also now required to produce a final report by 2031. This transforms the outlook from an indefinite grant expenditure to a time-limited, recoverable investment.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The program now introduces a potential long-term revenue stream for the state through the repayment of its equity share, with appreciation, from participating homeowners. This fundamentally changes the revenue impact from a net cost to a recoverable investment. The conveyance tax exemption is now explicitly clarified to apply to taxable years beginning January 1, 2026.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The program is now set to sunset on December 31, 2030, which fundamentally alters the long-term fiscal outlook by eliminating the creation of new, state-funded obligations after that date. The primary long-term fiscal impact will be the inflow of revenue to the State as participants repay their equity shares over a 15-year term. County obligations for monitoring existing deed-restricted properties will continue, but no new properties will enter the program.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The measure has been substantially amended, changing from a perpetual grant program to a pilot equity purchase program with a sunset date of December 31, 2030. The funding source is now the Rental Housing Revolving Fund, with a new annual cap of $2,000,000, and the State's investment is recoverable with appreciation. Key county concerns have been addressed by extending legal indemnification to county employees and allowing state funds to be used for administration, while new eligibility criteria prioritize government employees and homeowners with no other real property."
