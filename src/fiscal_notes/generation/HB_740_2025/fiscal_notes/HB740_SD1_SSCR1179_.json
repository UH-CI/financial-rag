  "overview": "The program has been fundamentally changed from a grant-based model to an equity purchase program, establishing it as a pilot initiative. It now includes a sunset clause effective December 31, 2030, and a requirement for the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation (HHFDC) to submit a final evaluation report. This reframes the measure as a temporary, evaluative effort rather than a permanent new program.",
  "appropriations": "Funding has been redirected from the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund to the Rental Housing Revolving Fund, with a newly specified annual cap of $2,000,000 for all counties combined. The assistance is now structured as an equity purchase, with a county's contribution per property limited to 8% of its appraised value. Counties are now explicitly authorized to use a portion of these funds to cover administrative costs.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The financial model has been revised from a non-recoverable grant to a recoverable equity purchase, requiring homeowners to repay the State's prorated share with appreciation within fifteen years or upon property sale. New eligibility criteria have been introduced, restricting participation to homeowners who own no other real property. The program also now prioritizes government employees as both homeowners and prospective tenants.",
  "agency_impact": "Key county-level concerns have been addressed by expanding the indemnification agreement to include county officers and employees, reducing their potential liability. Additionally, counties are now explicitly permitted to use a percentage of the allocated state funds for administrative costs, partially mitigating the risk of an unfunded mandate. HHFDC has the new responsibility of preparing a comprehensive program evaluation report for the Legislature by 2031.",
  "economic_impact": "The conversion to an equity purchase model introduces a mechanism for the State to recover its investment with appreciation, allowing the funds to be potentially recycled for future housing initiatives. The program's economic impact is now concentrated within a defined period due to its sunset on December 31, 2030. A new focus on prioritizing government employees aims to support public sector workforce retention.",
  "policy_impact": "The introduction of a sunset date of December 31, 2030, transforms the measure into a pilot program, resolving previous concerns about the perpetual nature of deed restrictions and their long-term impact on land use planning. New eligibility criteria have been added to narrow the program's scope, including a requirement that homeowners own no other real property and a prioritization for government employees. The shift from grants to a recoverable equity purchase aligns state investment with a model that seeks to replenish public funds.",
  "revenue_sources": "The designated funding source has been changed from the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund to the Rental Housing Revolving Fund. A significant change is the creation of a future revenue stream for the state, as the equity purchase model requires homeowners to repay the state's initial investment along with a share of the property's appreciation. This reframes the program from a simple state expenditure to a recoverable investment.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The fiscal outlook is now significantly more defined and contained due to new programmatic caps and a sunset date. HHFDC's annual allocation is capped at $2,000,000 from the Rental Housing Revolving Fund for the duration of the program, which sunsets on December 31, 2030. The program is structured as an equity purchase, requiring homeowners to repay the state's investment with appreciation within 15 years or at the time of sale, creating a mechanism for the state to recover its funds. The perpetual nature of the county's administrative burden is eliminated by the sunset clause, though enforcement of deed restrictions for participating properties will still be required. The authorization for counties to use a portion of funds for administrative costs provides a partial funding stream for their operational expenses during the program's life. HHFDC is also now required to produce a final report by 2031. This transforms the outlook from an indefinite grant expenditure to a time-limited, recoverable investment.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The program now introduces a potential long-term revenue stream for the state through the repayment of its equity share, with appreciation, from participating homeowners. This fundamentally changes the revenue impact from a net cost to a recoverable investment. The conveyance tax exemption is now explicitly clarified to apply to taxable years beginning January 1, 2026.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The program is now set to sunset on December 31, 2030, which fundamentally alters the long-term fiscal outlook by eliminating the creation of new, state-funded obligations after that date. The primary long-term fiscal impact will be the inflow of revenue to the State as participants repay their equity shares over a 15-year term. County obligations for monitoring existing deed-restricted properties will continue, but no new properties will enter the program.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The measure has been substantially amended, changing from a perpetual grant program to a pilot equity purchase program with a sunset date of December 31, 2030. The funding source is now the Rental Housing Revolving Fund, with a new annual cap of $2,000,000, and the State's investment is recoverable with appreciation. Key county concerns have been addressed by extending legal indemnification to county employees and allowing state funds to be used for administration, while new eligibility criteria prioritize government employees and homeowners with no other real property."
=======
  "overview": "The measure has been amended to change the Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) Financing and Deed Restriction Program from a grant-based initiative to an equity purchase program. A sunset date of December 31, 2030, has been established, effectively making it a pilot program. Additionally, the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation (HHFDC) is now required to submit an evaluation report to the Legislature by the 2031 Regular Session.",
  "appropriations": "The funding source for the program has been changed from the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund to the Rental Housing Revolving Fund. A statewide annual appropriation cap of $2,000,000 is now specified for the program. The state's financial contribution is limited to eight percent of the property's appraised value per ADU.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal model has fundamentally shifted from a grant expenditure to a recoverable equity purchase. A new provision requires homeowners to repay HHFDC's prorated share of the appraised value, including appreciation, within fifteen years or upon sale or transfer of the property. This introduces a long-term revenue recovery assumption, where initial outlays are considered investments rather than permanent costs.",
  "agency_impact": "To address previously stated county concerns, the measure now explicitly authorizes counties to use an unspecified percentage of awarded funds for administrative costs. The bill also expands the indemnification agreement to include counties and their officers, agents, and employees, thereby mitigating previously identified liability risks.",
  "economic_impact": "The program's economic model has been revised to an equity purchase structure, enabling the State to recover its investment along with a share of the property's appreciation. This creates a revolving fund mechanism that can finance additional ADUs in the future, maximizing the long-term impact of the initial state investment. The program now also prioritizes government employees as homeowners or tenants.",
  "policy_impact": "The program's structure is significantly altered from a grant to an equity purchase model, with a new sunset date of December 31, 2030. Eligibility criteria have been narrowed, requiring that homeowners or homebuyers own no other real property. A new provision prioritizes government employees for participation in the program.",
  "revenue_sources": "The funding source has been changed to the Rental Housing Revolving Fund. A new, long-term revenue stream for the state is created through the mandatory repayment of the equity purchase plus appreciation. The conveyance tax exemption for participating properties is now clarified to apply to taxable years beginning January 1, 2026.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The program is now defined with a sunset date of December 31, 2030, and a maximum annual expenditure of $2,000,000 from the Rental Housing Revolving Fund. The conversion to an equity purchase model with a 15-year repayment term means initial outlays are investments rather than grants. While no revenue from repayments is anticipated within the first six years, this structure establishes a framework for future revenue recovery to replenish the fund. An HHFDC evaluation report is required before the 2031 legislative session to inform any potential re-authorization of the program.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "A long-term positive impact on state operating revenue is now anticipated due to the equity purchase repayment requirement. The state will recover its principal investment plus a share of the property's appreciation within a 15-year period or upon sale, though this revenue stream will materialize after the initial six years. The effective date for the conveyance tax exemption is now set for January 1, 2026.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The program is now scheduled to sunset on December 31, 2030, which will cease new expenditures. However, a long-term fiscal obligation for the state will be to manage the incoming revenue from repayments as the 15-year terms conclude or properties are sold. This creates a self-replenishing funding mechanism for the Rental Housing Revolving Fund if the program is re-authorized in the future.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The program has been fundamentally restructured from a grant initiative to a repayable equity purchase program, with funding now sourced from the Rental Housing Revolving Fund under a $2,000,000 annual cap. Key changes include the addition of a 2030 sunset date, prioritization of government employees, extension of liability protection to counties, and authorization for counties to use funds for administrative costs. A long-term revenue recovery mechanism for the state has been created through the mandatory repayment of the equity investment with appreciation."
