  "overview": "",
  "appropriations": "This bill permits the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation to \"allocate funds from the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund to a county for the award of grants\" (HB740_HD1). The measure was amended by \"Authorizing the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation to allocate an annual lump sum, to be determined by the Corporation, rather than requiring the counties to apply for a specific minimum amount\" (HB740_HD1_HSCR53_). The measure now also prohibits the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation \"from distributing funds under the Program solely based on the population size of a county\" (HB740_HD1_HSCR53_).",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The program model has been clarified as a grant and deed restriction purchase, replacing the previous equity purchase model. The \"intent of the Legislature with this measure is for the amount paid to the property owner to be the market rate for a deed restriction\" (HB740_HD1_HSCR53_). This rate will be determined \"through a negotiation process between the county and the property owner\" (HB740_HD1_HSCR53_).",
  "agency_impact": "The Department of the Attorney General finds the bill \"does not appear to contain legally sufficient standards for the award of such grants involving public money as required by article VII, section 4, of the Constitution of the State of Hawaiâ€˜i\" (HB740_HD1). The Committee is \"working with the Department of the Attorney General on language that can withstand constitutional scrutiny to ensure that bona fide residents of the State can benefit from the Accessory Dwelling Unit Financing and Deed Restriction Program\" (HB740_HD1_HSCR53_). The Department of Taxation has requested that the proposed conveyance tax exemption \"take effect on January 1, 2026 to allow for form and instruction changes\" (HB740_TESTIMONY_HSG_01-29-25_).",
  "economic_impact": "",
  "policy_impact": "The measure was amended by \"Changing the effective date to July 1, 3000, to encourage further discussion\" (HB740_HD1_HSCR53_). Policy amendments include \"Deleting language that would have required a retiree or an individual with a disability to have worked for ten consecutive years and five consecutive years, respectively, in the county or State, to qualify as an owner-occupant under the Program\" (HB740_HD1_HSCR53_). The measure is also amended by \"Exempting any contract entered into by a county under the Program from the Procurement Code\" (HB740_HD1_HSCR53_).",
  "revenue_sources": "The source of funding for the program is the \"Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund\" (HB740_HD1). The previous equity purchase model, which would have provided a return to the state, has been removed. The measure now includes a conveyance tax exemption for \"any property with a county owned deed restriction pursuant to\" the program, which will result in a loss of state revenue (HB740_TESTIMONY_HSG_01-29-25_).",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The bill's effective date was changed to \"July 1, 3000, to encourage further discussion\" (HB740_HD1_HSCR53_). As a result, the program will have no fiscal implications within the next six years unless the effective date is amended. The Department of Taxation requested an effective date of January 1, 2026 for the implementation of a new conveyance tax exemption, which would represent a revenue loss beginning in that year if adopted (HB740_HD1_HSCR53_). Funding for the program is to be allocated from the \"Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund\" (HB740_HD1) as an \"annual lump sum\" to counties, but no expenditures will occur under the current effective date (HB740_HD1_HSCR53_).",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The previous version's revenue-generating equity purchase program has been removed from the bill. The primary impact to operating revenue is a loss resulting from a new conveyance tax exemption. It is the \"intent of your Committee to not subject any instruments by which a deed restriction is placed on a dwelling unit under the Accessory Dwelling Unit Financing and Deed Restriction Program (Program) to the conveyance tax\" (HB740_HD1_HSCR53_).",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The bill now authorizes the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation to \"allocate funds from the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund to a county for the award of grants to eligible homeowners and homebuyers to finance various costs associated with the construction of accessory dwelling units\" (HB740_HD1). No specific appropriation amount is included in the current version of the bill. No expenditures will be made under the current effective date.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "With the measure's effective date changed to \"July 1, 3000\" (HB740_HD1_HSCR53_), there are no fiscal implications after the six-year period. Should the date be amended, the program would require ongoing funding from the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund. The perpetual nature of the deed restrictions would also imply long-term administrative and monitoring responsibilities for the counties.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The program model is no longer an equity purchase program requiring repayment; it is now a grant program to finance accessory dwelling unit construction and purchase deed restrictions at a market rate. The funding source has changed from the Rental Housing Revolving Fund to the \"Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund\" (HB740_HD1). Instead of counties applying for grants from a capped fund, the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation will \"allocate an annual lump sum\" (HB740_HD1_HSCR53_). The effective date has been changed to \"July 1, 3000, to encourage further discussion\" (HB740_HD1_HSCR53_). New legal issues were raised by the Department of the Attorney General, which stated the bill lacks \"legally sufficient standards for the award of such grants\" (HB740_HD1)."
