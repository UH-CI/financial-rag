  "overview": "",
  "appropriations": "The method of funding allocation from the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund has been amended. Instead of counties applying for funds on a per-transaction basis, the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation is now authorized to provide each participating county with an annual lump-sum allocation. The distribution of these funds cannot be based solely on county population.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The methodology for fund distribution has changed to an annual lump-sum allocation model, which may alter the timing and predictability of fund outlays. Legislative intent clarifies that the cost basis for deed restriction purchases is the 'market rate' determined through negotiation between the county and homeowner. This confirms that costs per unit will be variable rather than a fixed grant amount.",
  "agency_impact": "The administrative workflow for the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation is modified; it will now focus on determining and disbursing annual lump-sum allocations to counties rather than processing individual funding applications from them. Counties will have greater autonomy in managing their annual budget for the program. The exemption of county contracts from the procurement code is expected to streamline local administration.",
  "economic_impact": "",
  "policy_impact": "The measure now clarifies that in planned communities, the program's deed restriction can be secondary to pre-existing covenants, increasing the program's feasibility. Eligibility requirements have been broadened by removing specific multi-year work history requirements for retirees and individuals with disabilities. Additionally, contracts executed by counties for this program are now explicitly exempt from the state procurement code.",
  "revenue_sources": "",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The Department of Taxation has requested that the conveyance tax exemption take effect on January 1, 2026, to allow for administrative implementation. This would delay the start of the associated revenue loss until the second half of fiscal year 2026. This specificity was not present in the previous analysis.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The funding mechanism has been changed from a per-application basis to an annual lump-sum allocation from the HHFDC to the counties, and funds cannot be distributed based solely on population. The bill now clarifies that deed restrictions may be secondary to existing covenants in planned communities, making the program more feasible. Eligibility has been broadened by removing specific durational work requirements for retirees and persons with disabilities, and county contracts under the program have been explicitly exempted from the state procurement code."
=======
  "overview": "This measure revises the program to be a direct purchase of a perpetual deed restriction at market value, rather than a recoverable equity purchase program. Eligibility has been broadened by removing prior work duration requirements for retirees and persons with disabilities. The program's sunset clause has been removed, shifting it from a pilot initiative to a potentially ongoing program.",
  "appropriations": "The allocation method has been changed to provide counties with an annual lump sum from the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation. A new provision stipulates that the distribution of these funds among counties cannot be based solely on population size. The annual funding limit and source remain unchanged.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The methodology for valuing the financial incentive for homeowners is now specified as the negotiated market rate for the deed restriction. The formula for allocating program funds among counties has also been updated, prohibiting distribution based solely on population. This provides a more defined framework for cost and allocation.",
  "agency_impact": "The administrative burden on counties is expected to be reduced, as contracts executed under this program are now exempt from the state Procurement Code. A significant implementation barrier has been removed by clarifying that the program's deed restriction can be secondary to existing covenants in planned communities. These changes streamline county-level administration of the program.",
  "economic_impact": "While the program aims to secure long-term workforce housing, the perpetual nature of the new deed restrictions has been identified as a potential concern that could negatively impact future land use flexibility and property rights.",
  "policy_impact": "The program's financial structure has been fundamentally altered from an equity purchase model with repayment to a direct expenditure model where the state purchases a deed restriction without recouping its investment. Eligibility criteria have been broadened by removing durational work requirements for certain applicants. The measure now clarifies that the program's deed restrictions are subordinate to existing covenants in planned communities, resolving a significant legal and policy conflict.",
  "revenue_sources": "The previously anticipated long-term revenue stream from homeowner repayments and shared appreciation has been eliminated. The program is now structured as a direct expenditure from the Rental Housing Revolving Fund with no mechanism for cost recovery. The only remaining revenue impact is a minor loss resulting from the new conveyance tax exemption.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The fiscal impact has changed from a recoverable investment to a direct, non-recoverable annual expenditure of up to $2,000,000 from the Rental Housing Revolving Fund. With the removal of the program's sunset clause, this expenditure is now projected to be an ongoing annual cost. This represents a recurring cost to the state rather than a temporary outlay that would be replenished over time.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The positive operating revenue impact from homeowner repayments, which was a key feature of the previous version, has been entirely eliminated. The program is no longer projected to generate a return to the Rental Housing Revolving Fund. Consequently, the only revenue impact is a minor negative effect from the conveyance tax exemption.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The removal of the sunset clause positions the program as an ongoing initiative with a recurring annual fiscal obligation of up to $2,000,000. Unlike the previous version, there is no longer an offsetting long-term revenue stream from repayments. This establishes a permanent, non-recoverable annual cost to sustain the program.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The program's financial model was changed from a recoverable equity purchase to a direct, non-repayable purchase of a deed restriction at market rate. The fund allocation process was amended to provide counties with an annual lump sum, and program-related contracts were exempted from the state Procurement Code. Key implementation barriers were addressed by allowing the deed restriction to be secondary to existing covenants and by broadening eligibility through the removal of durational work requirements for certain applicants."
