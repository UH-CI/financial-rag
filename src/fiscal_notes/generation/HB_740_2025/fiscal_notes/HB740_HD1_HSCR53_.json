  "overview": "This measure revises the program to be a direct purchase of a perpetual deed restriction at market value, rather than a recoverable equity purchase program. Eligibility has been broadened by removing prior work duration requirements for retirees and persons with disabilities. The program's sunset clause has been removed, shifting it from a pilot initiative to a potentially ongoing program.",
  "appropriations": "The allocation method has been changed to provide counties with an annual lump sum from the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation. A new provision stipulates that the distribution of these funds among counties cannot be based solely on population size. The annual funding limit and source remain unchanged.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The methodology for valuing the financial incentive for homeowners is now specified as the negotiated market rate for the deed restriction. The formula for allocating program funds among counties has also been updated, prohibiting distribution based solely on population. This provides a more defined framework for cost and allocation.",
  "agency_impact": "The administrative burden on counties is expected to be reduced, as contracts executed under this program are now exempt from the state Procurement Code. A significant implementation barrier has been removed by clarifying that the program's deed restriction can be secondary to existing covenants in planned communities. These changes streamline county-level administration of the program.",
  "economic_impact": "While the program aims to secure long-term workforce housing, the perpetual nature of the new deed restrictions has been identified as a potential concern that could negatively impact future land use flexibility and property rights.",
  "policy_impact": "The program's financial structure has been fundamentally altered from an equity purchase model with repayment to a direct expenditure model where the state purchases a deed restriction without recouping its investment. Eligibility criteria have been broadened by removing durational work requirements for certain applicants. The measure now clarifies that the program's deed restrictions are subordinate to existing covenants in planned communities, resolving a significant legal and policy conflict.",
  "revenue_sources": "The previously anticipated long-term revenue stream from homeowner repayments and shared appreciation has been eliminated. The program is now structured as a direct expenditure from the Rental Housing Revolving Fund with no mechanism for cost recovery. The only remaining revenue impact is a minor loss resulting from the new conveyance tax exemption.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The fiscal impact has changed from a recoverable investment to a direct, non-recoverable annual expenditure of up to $2,000,000 from the Rental Housing Revolving Fund. With the removal of the program's sunset clause, this expenditure is now projected to be an ongoing annual cost. This represents a recurring cost to the state rather than a temporary outlay that would be replenished over time.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The positive operating revenue impact from homeowner repayments, which was a key feature of the previous version, has been entirely eliminated. The program is no longer projected to generate a return to the Rental Housing Revolving Fund. Consequently, the only revenue impact is a minor negative effect from the conveyance tax exemption.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The removal of the sunset clause positions the program as an ongoing initiative with a recurring annual fiscal obligation of up to $2,000,000. Unlike the previous version, there is no longer an offsetting long-term revenue stream from repayments. This establishes a permanent, non-recoverable annual cost to sustain the program.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The program's financial model was changed from a recoverable equity purchase to a direct, non-repayable purchase of a deed restriction at market rate. The fund allocation process was amended to provide counties with an annual lump sum, and program-related contracts were exempted from the state Procurement Code. Key implementation barriers were addressed by allowing the deed restriction to be secondary to existing covenants and by broadening eligibility through the removal of durational work requirements for certain applicants."
