  "overview": "The purpose of this Act is to establish an accessory dwelling unit financing and deed restriction program under the Hawaii housing finance and development corporation. [3] This measure establishes the Accessory Dwelling Unit Financing and Deed Restriction Program to allocate funds to the counties to provide grants to eligible homeowners or homebuyers to finance construction costs, development costs, and non-reoccurring closing costs associated with the construction of an accessory dwelling unit and purchase deed restrictions on such property. [3] The program is intended to promote the development of additional housing while securing that housing for local residents working in Hawaii. [3]",
  "appropriations": "This measure does not contain a specific appropriation amount. [3] Instead, the bill authorizes the Hawaii housing finance and development corporation to allocate funds from the dwelling unit revolving fund. [3] Upon application by a county, the corporation may allocate an annual lump sum, in an amount to be determined by the corporation, necessary for a county to purchase a voluntary deed restriction from an eligible homeowner or homebuyer. [3]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal impact is indeterminate and depends on the number of participating counties and homeowners. [4] The amount paid to the property owner is intended to be the market rate for a deed restriction, determined through a negotiation process between the county and the property owner. [4] Costs will be driven by these negotiated rates and the volume of grants provided for ADU construction, with funds sourced from the dwelling unit revolving fund. [3]",
  "agency_impact": "The Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation (HHFDC) will establish and oversee the program, including allocating funds to counties and adopting rules. [3] The Department of Taxation (DOTAX) requests the conveyance tax exemption take effect on January 1, 2026 to allow for form and instruction changes. [2] Counties are responsible for applying for funds, ensuring program compliance, and may contract with non-government entities for assistance. [3]",
  "economic_impact": "The program is an innovative way to help alleviate the severe lack of housing for Hawaii residents and create immediate housing opportunities through ensuring long-term affordability through deed restrictions. [4] Estimates for ADU construction in Hawaii are about $250-$350 per square feet. [2] The bill provides a conveyance tax exemption for property sold for which a county has purchased a deed restriction. [3]",
  "policy_impact": "This measure establishes a new Accessory Dwelling Unit Financing and Deed Restriction Program by adding a new subpart to chapter 201H, Hawaii Revised Statutes. [3] It amends the procurement code to exempt contracts entered into by a county under the Program. [3] The bill also amends statutes related to county powers, conveyance tax, and the rule against perpetuities to facilitate the program. [3]",
  "revenue_sources": "The program is funded through the dwelling unit revolving fund, where all moneys received or collected by the corporation for this purpose shall be deposited. [3] If a property with a deed restriction is sold to a nonresident, the corporation shall be entitled to fifty per cent of appreciation at the time of sale, to be collected by the corporation and placed in the dwelling unit revolving fund. [3] The corporation and each county may also establish, revise, charge, and collect fees and premiums to effectuate the purposes of the program. [3]",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The six-year fiscal impact of this measure is indeterminate, as it depends on program participation. [4] The Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation is authorized to allocate an annual lump sum to counties from the dwelling unit revolving fund. [3] There will be an indeterminate loss of state revenue due to the conveyance tax exemption for properties with a county-owned deed restriction. [3] The Department of Taxation has requested an effective date of January 1, 2026, to implement the new conveyance tax exemption. [4] Ongoing administrative costs will be incurred by the HHFDC and participating counties for program management and compliance monitoring. [3] Any contract entered into by a county pursuant to this subpart shall be exempt from chapter 103D. [3] If a county does not expend allocated moneys within one year of receipt, the moneys shall be returned to the corporation. [3] The deed restrictions established are intended to run with the land in perpetuity, implying long-term costs. [3] No specific staffing increases are mentioned in the bill. [3] The bill's effective date has been changed to July 1, 3000, to encourage further discussion. [3]",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "This measure will cause an indeterminate loss of state revenue. [4] Property sold for which a county has purchased a deed restriction pursuant to this subpart shall be exempt from chapter 247, the conveyance tax. [3] The Department of Taxation requests that section 6 take effect on January 1, 2026 to allow for form and instruction changes necessary to implement the proposed conveyance tax exemption. [2]",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "This measure does not directly appropriate funds for state capital expenditures. [3] The program provides grants to eligible homeowners or homebuyers to finance construction costs, development costs, and non-reoccurring closing costs associated with the construction of an accessory dwelling unit. [3] These funds are allocated from the dwelling unit revolving fund to counties and then disbursed to private property owners. [3]",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The fiscal implications of this program are expected to be ongoing and long-term. [4] A deed restriction shall be recorded against the property and shall run with the land in perpetuity, binding all future owners, successors, and assigns. [3] This will result in perpetual administrative and compliance monitoring costs for counties and a recurring loss of state conveyance tax revenue. [3]",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The previous fiscal note indicated that counties would apply for funds as needed for each deed restriction purchase. [2] The updated measure, H.D. 1, authorizes the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation to allocate an annual lump sum to counties. [4] H.D. 1 now exempts any contract entered into by a county under the Program from the State Procurement Code. [4] The bill clarifies that for planned communities, a program deed restriction may be secondary to pre-existing covenants. [4] Language requiring a retiree or an individual with a disability to have worked for a certain number of consecutive years to qualify has been deleted. [4] The Department of Taxation has requested an effective date of January 1, 2026 for the conveyance tax exemption to allow time for implementation. [4] Finally, the measure's overall effective date has been changed to July 1, 3000, to encourage further discussion. [4]"
