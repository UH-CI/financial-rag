{
  "overview": "The proposed program is now structured as a grant and deed-restriction purchase initiative rather than an equity purchase model (HB740_HD1). It is to be funded by the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund, a change from the previously noted Rental Housing Revolving Fund (HB740_HD1). The measure's effective date has been changed to July 1, 3000, to encourage further discussion (HB740_HD1_HSCR53_).",
  "appropriations": "The specific annual appropriation cap has been removed; instead, the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation is authorized to allocate an unspecified annual lump sum from the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund to the counties (HB740_HD1_HSCR53_). This allocation is not to be based solely on county population size. No specific appropriation amount is provided in the current version of the bill.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The financial model has shifted from an equity purchase with state recovery to a grant program for Accessory Dwelling Unit construction costs and the purchase of deed restrictions (HB740_HD1). The amount paid to property owners for deed restrictions is intended to be at market rate, determined through a negotiation process between the county and the property owner (HB740_HD1_HSCR53_). This approach focuses on incentivizing participation rather than state investment recovery.",
  "agency_impact": "The Department of the Attorney General raised concerns that the bill lacks legally sufficient standards for awarding public money and recommended amendments to include such standards (HB740_HD1). The Department of Taxation requested that the conveyance tax exemption take effect on January 1, 2026, to allow for necessary changes to forms and instructions (HB740_HD1). Contracts for purchasing deed restrictions under the program are now exempt from the State Procurement Code (HB740_HD1_HSCR53_).",
  "economic_impact": "The economic benefit is now focused on the creation of a permanent stock of workforce housing through perpetual deed restrictions, rather than a recoverable state investment (HB740_HD1). The measure introduces a new conveyance tax exemption for properties with a county-owned deed restriction under this program. This will provide a financial incentive for participants but represents a loss of potential tax revenue.",
  "policy_impact": "The funding source for the program is changed to the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund (HB740_HD1). The policy is amended to exempt contracts entered into by a county for the purchase of deed restrictions from the State Procurement Code (HB740_HD1_HSCR53_). A defective effective date of July 1, 3000, has been inserted to facilitate further deliberation on the program's details (HB740_HD1).",
  "revenue_sources": "The program is now funded by the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund (HB740_HD1). Unlike the previous equity-recovery model, this version does not include a mechanism for the state to recoup funds. The introduction of a conveyance tax exemption for participating properties will result in a decrease in state tax revenue (HB740_TESTIMONY_HSG_01-29-25_).",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The change to a defective effective date of July 1, 3000 (HB740_HD1), eliminates any fiscal implications within the six-year outlook. The previous projection based on a specific annual cap is no longer valid, as the funding mechanism was changed to an unspecified annual lump sum determined by the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation from the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund (HB740_HD1_HSCR53_). Any future costs are deferred indefinitely pending a change in the effective date. The repayment plan detailed previously is no longer part of the program. The conveyance tax exemption, if the program were active, would reduce state revenues.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The program is no longer expected to be revenue-neutral or positive, as the equity purchase and repayment model has been removed. A new conveyance tax exemption for properties under the program will lead to a reduction in state operating revenue (HB740_HD1). The magnitude of this impact is indeterminate as it depends on program participation.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The program's effective date of July 1, 3000 (HB740_HD1), means there are no fiscal implications after the six-year period. If implemented, the shift from a 15-year repayment plan to perpetual deed restrictions would create indefinite, ongoing administrative and enforcement costs for the counties. The state's fiscal role would be limited to the initial funding from the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund without a repayment stream.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The primary updates include a fundamental change from an equity purchase model to a grant and deed-restriction purchase program. The funding source has been changed from the Rental Housing Revolving Fund to the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund (HB740_HD1). The specific annual funding cap was replaced with an unspecified annual lump sum, and the program's effective date was changed to July 1, 3000 (HB740_HD1), deferring all fiscal impacts. A new conveyance tax exemption for participating properties was also added, which will reduce state revenue."
