  "overview": "",
  "appropriations": "The method of funding allocation from the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund has been amended. Instead of counties applying for funds on a per-transaction basis, the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation is now authorized to provide each participating county with an annual lump-sum allocation. The distribution of these funds cannot be based solely on county population.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The methodology for fund distribution has changed to an annual lump-sum allocation model, which may alter the timing and predictability of fund outlays. Legislative intent clarifies that the cost basis for deed restriction purchases is the 'market rate' determined through negotiation between the county and homeowner. This confirms that costs per unit will be variable rather than a fixed grant amount.",
  "agency_impact": "The administrative workflow for the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation is modified; it will now focus on determining and disbursing annual lump-sum allocations to counties rather than processing individual funding applications from them. Counties will have greater autonomy in managing their annual budget for the program. The exemption of county contracts from the procurement code is expected to streamline local administration.",
  "economic_impact": "",
  "policy_impact": "The measure now clarifies that in planned communities, the program's deed restriction can be secondary to pre-existing covenants, increasing the program's feasibility. Eligibility requirements have been broadened by removing specific multi-year work history requirements for retirees and individuals with disabilities. Additionally, contracts executed by counties for this program are now explicitly exempt from the state procurement code.",

  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The Department of Taxation has requested that the conveyance tax exemption take effect on January 1, 2026, to allow for administrative implementation. This would delay the start of the associated revenue loss until the second half of fiscal year 2026. This specificity was not present in the previous analysis.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The funding mechanism has been changed from a per-application basis to an annual lump-sum allocation from the HHFDC to the counties, and funds cannot be distributed based solely on population. The bill now clarifies that deed restrictions may be secondary to existing covenants in planned communities, making the program more feasible. Eligibility has been broadened by removing specific durational work requirements for retirees and persons with disabilities, and county contracts under the program have been explicitly exempted from the state procurement code."
