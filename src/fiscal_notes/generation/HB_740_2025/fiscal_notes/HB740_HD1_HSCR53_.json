  "overview": "",
  "appropriations": "The corporation may allocate an annual lump sum, in an amount to be determined by the corporation, necessary for a county to purchase a voluntary deed restriction from an eligible homeowner or homebuyer. [3] This measure was amended to authorize the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation to allocate an annual lump sum rather than requiring the counties to apply for a specific minimum amount. [4] The measure now prohibits the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation from distributing funds under the Program solely based on the population size of a county. [4]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The Committee notes that the intent of the Legislature with this measure is for the amount paid to the property owner to be the market rate for a deed restriction. [4] It is intended that through a negotiation process between the county and the property owner, the rate will be high enough to incentivize a property owner to sell a deed restriction, while low enough that it remains an effective use of government funds. [4]",
  "agency_impact": "The Department of Taxation (DOTAX) requests section 6 take effect on January 1, 2026 to allow for form and instruction changes necessary to implement the proposed conveyance tax exemption. [2] The Committee further notes that the Department of Taxation requested in its testimony that an effective date of January 1, 2026 be included, to allow the Department sufficient time to make changes necessary for the implementation of the new conveyance tax exemption. [4]",
  "economic_impact": "",
  "policy_impact": "The measure has been amended to exempt any contract entered into by a county under the Program from the Procurement Code. [4] Language that would have required a retiree or an individual with a disability to have worked for a set number of consecutive years to qualify as an owner-occupant under the Program has been deleted. [4] The bill was amended to clarify that for a planned community, a deed restriction placed and owned by a county may be secondary only to conditions, covenants, and restrictions with a requisite first position. [4] The effective date has been changed to July 1, 3000, to encourage further discussion. [4]",
  "revenue_sources": "",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The Act's effective date has been changed to July 1, 3000, deferring any fiscal implications beyond the six-year planning period. [3] The Department of Taxation has requested that the new conveyance tax exemption have an effective date of January 1, 2026 to allow for implementation time, which could introduce a fiscal impact within the six-year window if adopted.

  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The effective date of this Act is July 1, 3000, meaning there are no fiscal implications after six years based on the current version of the measure. [3]",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The funding mechanism for counties has been changed from an on-demand application model to an annual lump sum allocated by the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation. [4] The bill now prohibits the distribution of funds based solely on a county's population size. [4] Any contract entered into by a county under the program is now exempt from the Procurement Code. [4] Previous durational work requirements for retirees and individuals with disabilities to qualify for the program have been deleted. [4] A significant change is the amended effective date to July 1, 3000, which postpones all fiscal impacts of the program. [4] Additionally, the Department of Taxation has requested an implementation date of January 1, 2026 for the new conveyance tax exemption to allow for administrative changes. [4]"
