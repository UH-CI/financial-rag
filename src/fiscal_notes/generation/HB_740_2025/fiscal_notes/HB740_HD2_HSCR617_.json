  "overview": "The purpose of this Act is to establish an accessory dwelling unit financing and deed restriction program under the Hawaii housing finance and development corporation. [6] This measure is intended to promote the development of additional housing while securing that housing for local residents working in Hawaii. [6] The program allocates funds to the counties to provide grants to eligible homeowners or homebuyers to finance construction costs, development costs, and non-reoccurring closing costs associated with the construction of an accessory dwelling unit and purchase deed restrictions on such property. [7]",
  "appropriations": "This measure does not contain a specific appropriation. [6] Instead, the bill authorizes the corporation to allocate funds from the dwelling unit revolving fund established under section 201H-191 to a county. [6] Upon application by a county, the corporation may allocate an annual lump sum, in an amount to be determined by the corporation, necessary for a county to purchase a voluntary deed restriction from an eligible homeowner or homebuyer. [6]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal impact is indeterminate as it depends on the number of counties that apply for funds and the number of homeowners who participate in the program. [6] Costs will be driven by the amount of grants provided to eligible homeowners or homebuyers to finance construction costs, development costs, and non-reoccurring closing costs associated with an accessory dwelling unit. [6] The amount paid for a deed restriction will be determined through negotiations between counties and eligible homeowners. [6]",
  "agency_impact": "The Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation (HHFDC) will establish the program, allocate funds from the dwelling unit revolving fund, and may adopt rules. [6] Counties are responsible for applying for funds, ensuring compliance with the subpart, and may contract with non-government entities for assistance. [6] The Department of Taxation requests that the conveyance tax exemption take effect on January 1, 2026, to allow for form and instruction changes. [7]",
  "economic_impact": "This program offers an effective solution to increase housing supply, especially in residential areas with available space for additional dwellings. [7] The program provides grants for ADU construction while ensuring long-term affordability through deed restrictions. [5] The legislative document specifies any document or instrument in which there is a consideration of $100 (HB740_HD2_.HTM.txt) or less paid or to be paid is exempt from the conveyance tax. [6]",
  "policy_impact": "This measure establishes the Accessory Dwelling Unit Financing and Deed Restriction Program by adding a new subpart to chapter 201H, Hawaii Revised Statutes. [6] In response to testimony from the Department of the Attorney General, the measure was amended by inserting appropriate standards for grant awards. [7] The measure also provides that purchasing deed restrictions under the program is exempt from the Procurement Code and clarifies the exemption from conveyance taxes. [5] [7]",
  "revenue_sources": "The program will be funded by allocations from the dwelling unit revolving fund. [6] The corporation and each county may establish, revise, charge, and collect fees and premiums and impose costs as necessary to effectuate the purposes of this subpart. [6] If a property with a deed restriction is sold to a nonresident, the corporation shall be entitled to fifty per cent of appreciation at the time of sale, to be collected and placed in the dwelling unit revolving fund. [6]",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The six-year fiscal impact of this measure is indeterminate. [7] The Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation (HHFDC) is authorized to allocate an annual lump sum from the dwelling unit revolving fund to counties that apply. [6] There will be an indeterminate loss of state revenue due to the conveyance tax exemption for any document or instrument conveying real property with a county-owned deed restriction. [6] The Committee notes that the Department of Taxation is requesting that the conveyance tax exemption take effect on January 1, 2026, to allow for form and instruction changes necessary to implement the proposed exemption. [7] Ongoing administrative costs for program management and compliance monitoring will be incurred by HHFDC and participating counties. [6] Any contract entered into by a county pursuant to this subpart shall be exempt from chapter 103D. [6] If a county does not expend moneys allocated pursuant to this section within one year of receipt, the moneys shall be returned to the corporation and placed in the dwelling unit revolving fund. [6] The deed restriction shall be recorded against the property and shall run with the land in perpetuity, implying long-term monitoring costs and revenue loss. [6] No specific staffing increases are mentioned in the bill. [6] The Act has an effective date of July 1, 3000. [6]",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "This measure will cause an indeterminate loss of state revenue. [7] Property sold for which a county has purchased a deed restriction pursuant to this subpart shall be exempt from chapter 247, the conveyance tax. [6] The Department of Taxation requests that the conveyance tax exemption take effect on January 1, 2026, to allow for necessary form and instruction changes. [7]",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "This measure does not directly appropriate funds for state capital expenditures. [6] The program provides grants to eligible homeowners or homebuyers to finance construction costs, development costs, and non-reoccurring closing costs associated with the construction of an accessory dwelling unit. [6] These funds are allocated to counties from the dwelling unit revolving fund and then disbursed to private property owners. [6]",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The fiscal implications of this program are expected to be ongoing and long-term. [5] A deed restriction shall be recorded against the property and shall run with the land in perpetuity, binding all future owners, successors, and assigns. [6] This will result in perpetual administrative and compliance monitoring costs for counties and a recurring loss of state conveyance tax revenue. [6] [6]",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "Based on testimony from the Department of the Attorney General that the measure did not appear to contain legally sufficient standards for the award of grants, H.B. No. 740, H.D. 2 has been amended by inserting appropriate standards for grant awards. [7] The Department of Taxation requested clarification on the conveyance tax exemption, and H.D. 2 amends the bill by clarifying the exemption from conveyance taxes. [7] [7] Specifically, the bill now exempts any document or instrument conveying a county-owned deed restriction itself. [6]"
