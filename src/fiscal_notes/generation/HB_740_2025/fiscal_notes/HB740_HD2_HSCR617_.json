  "overview": "To address constitutional concerns raised by the Department of the Attorney General, the measure has been amended to include legally sufficient standards for the award of public grants. This change establishes a formal set of criteria that applicants must meet to receive funding. The program's core function of providing grants for Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) construction in exchange for a deed restriction remains the same.",
  "appropriations": "The funding source for the program is specified as the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund (DURF), not the Rental Housing Revolving Fund as previously noted. The bill authorizes the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation (HHFDC) to allocate funds from the DURF to the counties. No specific appropriation amount is included in this measure.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The methodology has been updated to incorporate specific legal standards for grant eligibility and awards, as recommended by the Attorney General. Counties will now be required to assess applications against these new, mandated criteria. This ensures compliance with state constitutional requirements for the use of public funds.",
  "agency_impact": "Counties will now have the added administrative responsibility of implementing and enforcing the newly established legal standards for grant awards. This involves verifying applicant eligibility based on a defined set of criteria to ensure constitutional compliance. The Department of Taxation will need to update forms and instructions to reflect the clarified conveyance tax exemption.",
  "economic_impact": "",
  "policy_impact": "The measure now incorporates constitutionally required standards for the disbursement of public funds as grants, resolving a significant legal issue identified by the Attorney General. Additionally, the policy has been refined by clarifying that the conveyance tax exemption applies to both the instrument conveying the real property and the instrument conveying the deed restriction itself. These changes strengthen the program's legal and administrative framework.",
  "revenue_sources": "The funding source for this program has been correctly identified as the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund (DURF), which is a change from what was previously reported. The measure confirms a minor negative revenue impact through a newly clarified conveyance tax exemption. There is no mechanism for the fund to be replenished through this program.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The fiscal implications have been revised; instead of a specific capped amount, the measure now authorizes an indeterminate annual expenditure from the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund (DURF). The cost will be dependent on the number of eligible homeowners who participate in the program and the amount of funds the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation allocates annually. This creates a variable and ongoing financial commitment for the DURF.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The scope of the conveyance tax exemption has been clarified based on recommendations from the Department of Taxation. This clarification solidifies the anticipated minor negative impact on state operating revenues resulting from exempting these specific real property conveyances. No other changes to operating revenue are anticipated.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The program's fiscal obligation is an ongoing, indeterminate draw on the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund, as the measure does not establish a sunset clause or an annual funding cap. The long-term cost will depend on future participation rates and fund allocations. This differs from the previously noted specific annual cap.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The primary updates to the measure include the addition of legally-required standards for grant awards to address constitutional concerns raised by the Attorney General. The funding source has been corrected to the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund (DURF). Additionally, the conveyance tax exemption has been clarified based on input from the Department of Taxation."
