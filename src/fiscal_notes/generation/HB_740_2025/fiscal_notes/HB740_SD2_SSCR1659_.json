{
  "overview": "The measure's scope has been expanded beyond the Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) program to now include a significant appropriation for infrastructure projects. While the core purpose of establishing the ADU financing program remains, the bill now also serves as a vehicle for direct state investment in infrastructure. This addition broadens the bill's overall intent from a targeted housing incentive to include general infrastructure development.",
  "appropriations": "The funding source for a major new component of the bill has been designated as the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund (DURF), a change from the Rental Housing Revolving Fund previously specified for the ADU program. A new, one-time appropriation of $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2025-2026 is recommended. These funds are explicitly designated for infrastructure projects to be expended by the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation (HHFDC).",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "A new cost component has been introduced that assumes a direct, one-time expenditure of $20,000,000 on infrastructure projects. Unlike the ADU equity purchase program, this appropriation is not structured as a recoverable investment. The fiscal impact is calculated as a direct outlay from the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund in fiscal year 2025-2026.",
  "agency_impact": "The Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation's (HHFDC) responsibilities are significantly expanded. In addition to managing the ADU equity program, the HHFDC is now tasked with overseeing and expending a $20,000,000 appropriation for infrastructure projects. This new mandate will require substantial administrative and operational resources for project management and fund disbursement.",
  "economic_impact": "The measure is now expected to generate a direct, short-term economic stimulus through a $20,000,000 investment in infrastructure projects. This is distinct from the long-term, revolving impact of the ADU equity program. The new appropriation is anticipated to support construction-related jobs and improve public infrastructure, providing a different category of economic benefit.",
  "policy_impact": "The bill's policy focus has been broadened to incorporate direct state funding for infrastructure development, in addition to the ADU housing incentive program. This amendment expands the measure's scope from solely addressing housing supply through private homeowner incentives to also include public works. This dual focus represents a significant shift in the legislative strategy of the bill.",
  "revenue_sources": "The Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund is now identified as the source for a new, one-time appropriation of $20,000,000. This is a notable change, as the previous version of the bill had shifted the ADU program's funding to the Rental Housing Revolving Fund. This new appropriation represents a significant, distinct funding allocation within the measure.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "A significant new fiscal impact has been introduced: a one-time expenditure of $20,000,000 from the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund in fiscal year 2025-2026 for infrastructure. This is in addition to the ADU program's annual outlays. Concurrently, a recurring revenue loss from the conveyance tax exemption is now quantified, with projected general fund losses of $0.9 million in FY 2026, $1.9 million in FY 2027, $2.0 million in FY 2028, $2.1 million in FY 2029, and $2.2 million in FY 2030. This combination of a large, one-time capital expenditure and a specified annual revenue loss substantially alters the bill's six-year fiscal profile.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The conveyance tax exemption, effective January 1, 2026, is now estimated to result in a specific general fund revenue loss. The Department of Taxation projects losses of $0.9 million in FY 2026, $1.9 million in FY 2027, and $2.0 million in FY 2028. These projected losses continue to increase annually through the program's sunset date.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "This measure now includes a direct capital expenditure of $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2025-2026. These funds are explicitly appropriated for infrastructure projects under the administration of the HHFDC. This represents a substantial new investment in state capital infrastructure that was absent from the previous version of the bill.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The one-time $20,000,000 appropriation for infrastructure will not have direct recurring costs after the initial expenditure. However, the infrastructure created may result in new, long-term maintenance and operational costs for the state or counties. The fiscal sustainability of these new assets will need to be considered in future budgets.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The bill has been significantly amended to include a new, one-time appropriation of $20,000,000 for infrastructure projects in fiscal year 2025-2026. This funding is sourced from the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund, a notable shift as the core ADU program was previously funded from the Rental Housing Revolving Fund. This expansion broadens the bill's fiscal scope from a targeted housing incentive program to a dual-purpose measure that now also funds major capital expenditures."
