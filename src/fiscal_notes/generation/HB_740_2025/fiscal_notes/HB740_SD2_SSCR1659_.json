  "overview": "This measure now includes a significant, one-time appropriation for infrastructure projects, expanding the bill's scope beyond solely financing accessory dwelling units. The program's sunset date is clarified to be January 1, 2031. The Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation is tasked with expending these new infrastructure funds.",
  "appropriations": "A new, one-time appropriation of $20,000,000 from the general revenues of the State is established for fiscal year 2025-2026. These funds are to be deposited into the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund. Subsequently, the measure appropriates $20,000,000 from the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund to be expended by the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation for infrastructure projects.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The Department of Taxation has provided specific revenue loss projections related to the conveyance tax exemption created by the measure. The estimated impact on the General Fund is a loss of $0.9 million in FY 2026, increasing annually to $2.3 million in FY 2031. These calculations are based on the number of properties expected to participate in the program and receive the tax exemption.",
  "agency_impact": "In addition to administering the Accessory Dwelling Unit program, the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation is now responsible for expending a new $20,000,000 appropriation designated for infrastructure projects. The Department of Taxation will be required to administer the new conveyance tax exemption, which takes effect on January 1, 2026. This will result in a measurable reduction in General Fund revenues.",
  "economic_impact": "The measure will result in a direct negative impact on General Fund revenues due to the conveyance tax exemption for participating properties. The Department of Taxation estimates this revenue loss will begin at $0.9 million in fiscal year 2026. The loss is projected to increase to $1.9 million in FY 2027, $2.0 million in FY 2028, $2.1 million in FY 2029, $2.2 million in FY 2030, and $2.3 million in FY 2031.",
  "policy_impact": "",
  "revenue_sources": "The measure now designates general fund revenues as the source for a new, one-time $20,000,000 appropriation in fiscal year 2025-2026. These funds will be channeled through the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund specifically for infrastructure projects. This is in addition to the previously identified Rental Housing Revolving Fund for the ADU equity purchase program.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The six-year outlook now includes a one-time appropriation of $20,000,000 from the General Fund in fiscal year 2025-2026 for infrastructure projects, to be expended by the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation. In parallel, the measure will create a recurring revenue loss to the General Fund from the conveyance tax exemption. According to the Department of Taxation, this loss is projected to be $0.9 million in FY 2026, $1.9 million in FY 2027, $2.0 million in FY 2028, $2.1 million in FY 2029, $2.2 million in FY 2030, and $2.3 million in FY 2031. These figures are in addition to the previously established $2,000,000 annual cap on allocations from the Rental Housing Revolving Fund for the ADU program itself.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The conveyance tax exemption is now quantified with specific negative revenue impact projections from the Department of Taxation. The estimated reduction in General Fund revenues is $0.9 million in FY 2026, rising annually to $2.3 million by FY 2031. This provides a precise forecast of the operating revenue loss associated with the program.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "A new capital expenditure of $20,000,000 is appropriated for fiscal year 2025-2026. These funds originate from general revenues and are directed through the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund. The Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation is tasked with expending this amount specifically for infrastructure projects.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The projected revenue loss to the General Fund from the conveyance tax exemption is now expected to continue beyond the six-year outlook. The Department of Taxation estimates a revenue loss of $2.3 million for fiscal year 2031, which occurs after the program sunsets. This indicates an ongoing, though non-compounding, fiscal impact from properties that participated in the program.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The most significant update is the addition of a new, one-time $20,000,000 appropriation from the General Fund for infrastructure projects in fiscal year 2025-2026. This expands the bill's fiscal scope beyond the ADU equity purchase program. Additionally, the fiscal impact of the conveyance tax exemption has been specifically quantified by the Department of Taxation, projecting an annual revenue loss to the General Fund from FY 2026 through FY 2031."
=======
  "overview": "The measure's scope has been expanded beyond the Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) program to now include a significant appropriation for infrastructure projects. While the core purpose of establishing the ADU financing program remains, the bill now also serves as a vehicle for direct state investment in infrastructure. This addition broadens the bill's overall intent from a targeted housing incentive to include general infrastructure development.",
  "appropriations": "The funding source for a major new component of the bill has been designated as the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund (DURF), a change from the Rental Housing Revolving Fund previously specified for the ADU program. A new, one-time appropriation of $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2025-2026 is recommended. These funds are explicitly designated for infrastructure projects to be expended by the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation (HHFDC).",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "A new cost component has been introduced that assumes a direct, one-time expenditure of $20,000,000 on infrastructure projects. Unlike the ADU equity purchase program, this appropriation is not structured as a recoverable investment. The fiscal impact is calculated as a direct outlay from the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund in fiscal year 2025-2026.",
  "agency_impact": "The Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation's (HHFDC) responsibilities are significantly expanded. In addition to managing the ADU equity program, the HHFDC is now tasked with overseeing and expending a $20,000,000 appropriation for infrastructure projects. This new mandate will require substantial administrative and operational resources for project management and fund disbursement.",
  "economic_impact": "The measure is now expected to generate a direct, short-term economic stimulus through a $20,000,000 investment in infrastructure projects. This is distinct from the long-term, revolving impact of the ADU equity program. The new appropriation is anticipated to support construction-related jobs and improve public infrastructure, providing a different category of economic benefit.",
  "policy_impact": "The bill's policy focus has been broadened to incorporate direct state funding for infrastructure development, in addition to the ADU housing incentive program. This amendment expands the measure's scope from solely addressing housing supply through private homeowner incentives to also include public works. This dual focus represents a significant shift in the legislative strategy of the bill.",
  "revenue_sources": "The Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund is now identified as the source for a new, one-time appropriation of $20,000,000. This is a notable change, as the previous version of the bill had shifted the ADU program's funding to the Rental Housing Revolving Fund. This new appropriation represents a significant, distinct funding allocation within the measure.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "A significant new fiscal impact has been introduced: a one-time expenditure of $20,000,000 from the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund in fiscal year 2025-2026 for infrastructure. This is in addition to the ADU program's annual outlays. Concurrently, a recurring revenue loss from the conveyance tax exemption is now quantified, with projected general fund losses of $0.9 million in FY 2026, $1.9 million in FY 2027, $2.0 million in FY 2028, $2.1 million in FY 2029, and $2.2 million in FY 2030. This combination of a large, one-time capital expenditure and a specified annual revenue loss substantially alters the bill's six-year fiscal profile.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The conveyance tax exemption, effective January 1, 2026, is now estimated to result in a specific general fund revenue loss. The Department of Taxation projects losses of $0.9 million in FY 2026, $1.9 million in FY 2027, and $2.0 million in FY 2028. These projected losses continue to increase annually through the program's sunset date.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "This measure now includes a direct capital expenditure of $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2025-2026. These funds are explicitly appropriated for infrastructure projects under the administration of the HHFDC. This represents a substantial new investment in state capital infrastructure that was absent from the previous version of the bill.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The one-time $20,000,000 appropriation for infrastructure will not have direct recurring costs after the initial expenditure. However, the infrastructure created may result in new, long-term maintenance and operational costs for the state or counties. The fiscal sustainability of these new assets will need to be considered in future budgets.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The bill has been significantly amended to include a new, one-time appropriation of $20,000,000 for infrastructure projects in fiscal year 2025-2026. This funding is sourced from the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund, a notable shift as the core ADU program was previously funded from the Rental Housing Revolving Fund. This expansion broadens the bill's fiscal scope from a targeted housing incentive program to a dual-purpose measure that now also funds major capital expenditures."
