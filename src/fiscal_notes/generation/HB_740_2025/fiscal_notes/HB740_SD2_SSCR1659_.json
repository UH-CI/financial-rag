  "overview": "This measure has been amended to include a significant new component beyond the Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) Financing and Deed Restriction Program. It now appropriates funds specifically for infrastructure projects to be administered by the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation (HHFDC). While the core ADU program remains, this version expands the bill's scope to include direct capital investment in infrastructure.",
  "appropriations": "The measure now includes a new appropriation of $20,000,000 (HB740_SD2_SSCR1659_) from the general revenues of the State for fiscal year 2025-2026, to be deposited into the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund (HB740_SD2). A corresponding appropriation of $20,000,000 (HB740_SD2_SSCR1659_) is made from the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund for the same fiscal year for infrastructure projects (HB740_SD2). This is separate from the ADU program's existing authorization to use up to $2,000,000 (HB740_SD2) annually from the Rental Housing Revolving Fund.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The Department of Taxation (DOTAX) has provided specific revenue loss estimates related to the bill's conveyance tax exemption. The methodology assumes a progressive loss to the general fund, starting at -$0.9 million (HB740_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_) in fiscal year 2026. The testimony from the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation assumes that the $2,000,000 (HB740_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_) annual program cap will enroll approximately 17 properties per year.",
  "agency_impact": "The Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation (HHFDC) is now tasked with an additional responsibility of expending a significant one-time appropriation for infrastructure projects (HB740_SD2). This new function is distinct from the administration of the ADU program and will require the agency to manage large-scale capital projects. This represents a substantial expansion of HHFDC's operational scope for fiscal year 2025-2026.",
  "economic_impact": "The measure is now expected to generate economic activity through a one-time infusion of $20,000,000 (HB740_SD2_SSCR1659_) for infrastructure projects, impacting the construction sector. Concurrently, the conveyance tax exemption for program properties will result in a direct revenue loss to the State's general fund. Testimony from the Department of Taxation estimates this loss to be -$0.9 million (HB740_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_) in FY 2026, increasing annually to -$2.3 million (HB740_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_) by FY 2031.",
  "policy_impact": "A significant policy clarification is that while the ADU program itself sunsets on January 1, 2031 (HB740_SD2), the deed restrictions placed on properties through the program are intended to run with the land in perpetuity (HB740_SD2). This creates a long-term enforcement obligation for the counties that extends indefinitely beyond the program's operational period. Additionally, the bill now directly links housing initiatives with capital infrastructure spending by appropriating funds for both within the same measure.",
  "revenue_sources": "This version introduces a new, one-time funding source for a component of the bill. It appropriates $20,000,000 (HB740_SD2_SSCR1659_) from the State's general revenues for fiscal year 2025-2026, which is directed to the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund for infrastructure projects. The ADU program's funding mechanism remains unchanged, drawing from the separate Rental Housing Revolving Fund.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The fiscal outlook now includes a one-time general fund expenditure of $20,000,000 (HB740_SD2_SSCR1659_) in fiscal year 2025-2026 for infrastructure projects, administered through the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund. In addition to the ongoing ADU program costs from the Rental Housing Revolving Fund, the State's general fund will experience a direct revenue loss due to the conveyance tax exemption. Based on Department of Taxation testimony, this loss is projected to be -$0.9 million (HB740_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_) in FY 2026, -$1.9 million (HB740_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_) in FY 2027, -$2.0 million (HB740_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_) in FY 2028, -$2.1 million (HB740_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_) in FY 2029, and -$2.2 million (HB740_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_) in FY 2030. The ADU program continues to have an annual allocation limit of $2,000,000 (HB740_SD2) from the Rental Housing Revolving Fund. The requirement for HHFDC to submit a program evaluation report prior to the 2031 legislative session remains in effect (HB740_SD2).",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "New information from the Department of Taxation quantifies the negative impact on operating revenue resulting from the conveyance tax exemption. The general fund revenue loss is estimated at -$0.9 million (HB740_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_) in FY 2026 and is projected to increase each subsequent year through FY 2031. This provides specific figures for the revenue reduction that was previously mentioned without quantification.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "This measure now includes a direct and significant capital expenditure. It appropriates $20,000,000 (HB740_SD2_SSCR1659_) in fiscal year 2025-2026 for infrastructure projects. These funds are to be expended by the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation for this specific purpose.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "While the ADU program sunsets, the deed restrictions it creates are perpetual, implying an ongoing, though unfunded, compliance and enforcement responsibility for the counties indefinitely (HB740_SD2). The revenue loss from the conveyance tax exemption is projected to continue, with an estimated impact of -$2.3 million (HB740_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_) in FY 2031. Repayments from the ADU equity purchase program will continue to return to the Rental Housing Revolving Fund for up to fifteen years after origination.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The measure now includes a major new appropriation of $20,000,000 (HB740_SD2_SSCR1659_) from general funds in FY 2025-2026 for infrastructure projects, a component not present in the previous version. The fiscal note now incorporates specific annual revenue loss projections from the Department of Taxation due to the conveyance tax exemption, starting at -$0.9 million (HB740_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_) in FY 2026. A key policy detail has been clarified: although the ADU program sunsets in 2031, the deed restrictions established under it are perpetual (HB740_SD2)."
