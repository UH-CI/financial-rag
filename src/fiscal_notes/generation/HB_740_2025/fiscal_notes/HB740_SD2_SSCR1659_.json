  "overview": "The purpose of the Act remains to establish an accessory dwelling unit financing and deed restriction program, but the measure has been amended to also include appropriations for \"infrastructure projects\" (HB740_SD2_.HTM.txt). This expands the scope beyond financing individual ADU construction. The core of the ADU program is still based on the purchase of equity and deed restrictions.",
  "appropriations": "This measure now appropriates an unspecified sum from the \"general revenues of the State of Hawaii\" for fiscal year 2025-2026 to be deposited into the \"dwelling unit revolving fund\" (HB740_SD2_.HTM.txt). A second appropriation is made from the dwelling unit revolving fund for \"infrastructure projects\" (HB740_SD2_.HTM.txt). Your Committee recommends an appropriation amount of $20,000,000 (HB740_SD2_SSCR1659_.PDF.txt) into the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund for these purposes.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "New testimony from the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation provides more detail on the program's potential reach under the existing funding cap. With a ceiling of $2,000,000 (HB740_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt) per year and an assumption that \"$40,000 of equity is provided for each ADU\" (HB740_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt), \"the program will be able to enroll about 17 properties per year\" (HB740_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt).",
  "agency_impact": "The Department of Taxation has provided a quantified fiscal impact resulting from the conveyance tax exemption in Section 6 of the bill. The department \"estimates a revenue loss\" to the General Fund that begins at -$0.9 million in FY 2026 and increases to -$2.3 million by FY 2031 (HB740_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt). This provides a specific financial impact on DOTAX's collections.",
  "economic_impact": "While the equity purchase model allows the state to recover its investment, new testimony identifies a negative economic impact through revenue loss. The Department of Taxation estimates a General Fund revenue loss starting at -$0.9 million in FY 2026 due to the bill's conveyance tax exemption (HB740_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt). This quantified loss represents a direct reduction in state revenue.",
  "policy_impact": "The measure has been amended to broaden its policy objectives by including an appropriation for \"infrastructure projects\" (HB740_SD2_.HTM.txt). This shifts the bill's focus from solely incentivizing individual ADU construction to also supporting the underlying infrastructure needed for housing development. The funding for this new component is sourced from general revenues via the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund, a change from the previously designated Rental Housing Revolving Fund for the ADU program itself.",
  "revenue_sources": "A new funding source has been introduced for a portion of this measure, with an appropriation from \"general revenues of the State of Hawaii\" to be deposited into the \"dwelling unit revolving fund\" (HB740_SD2_.HTM.txt) for infrastructure projects. Additionally, the Department of Taxation has identified a negative impact on revenue, estimating a loss to the General Fund from the conveyance tax exemption that will reach -$2.3 million by FY 2031 (HB740_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt).",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The six-year outlook now includes a significant, one-time appropriation for infrastructure projects in fiscal year 2025-2026, with a recommended amount of $20,000,000 (HB740_SD2_SSCR1659_.PDF.txt). In addition to the previously established $2,000,000 (HB740_SD2_.HTM.txt) annual cap for the ADU program, there is a newly quantified negative fiscal implication from the Department of Taxation. The department projects a recurring revenue loss to the General Fund due to the conveyance tax exemption, with the \"General Fund Impact ($ millions)\" estimated as follows: \"FY 2026 -0.9 FY 2027 -1.9 FY 2028 -2.0 FY 2029 -2.1 FY 2030 -2.2 FY 2031 -2.3\" (HB740_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt). This creates a compounding loss of revenue over the six-year period, offsetting some of the program's long-term financial recovery through equity repayments.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "There is a newly quantified negative impact on the state's operating revenue. The Department of Taxation \"estimates a revenue loss\" from the conveyance tax exemption for properties with a county-owned deed restriction (HB740_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt). This loss is projected to grow annually, from -$0.9 million in FY 2026 to -$2.3 million in FY 2031 (HB740_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt).",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The measure has been amended to include a significant new capital expenditure. It now appropriates funds out of the dwelling unit revolving fund for \"infrastructure projects\" (HB740_SD2_.HTM.txt). The Committee on Ways and Means \"recommends an appropriation amount of $20,000,000\" (HB740_SD2_SSCR1659_.PDF.txt) for this purpose in fiscal year 2025-2026.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The program is set to be repealed on January 1, 2031 (HB740_SD2_.HTM.txt). However, the Department of Taxation's estimate of a -$2.3 million revenue loss for FY 2031 suggests that the fiscal impact of the conveyance tax exemption will persist until the program's sunset date (HB740_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt). After the sunset, no new deed restrictions would be created, thus stopping any further growth of this revenue loss.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "This measure has been amended to include a new, significant appropriation for \"infrastructure projects\" (HB740_SD2_.HTM.txt), with a recommended amount of $20,000,000 (HB740_SD2_SSCR1659_.PDF.txt) for fiscal year 2025-2026, funded by general revenues through the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund. The Department of Taxation has provided new analysis quantifying a recurring revenue loss to the General Fund from the conveyance tax exemption, projected to reach -$2.3 million by FY 2031 (HB740_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt). Additionally, HHFDC testimony estimates the ADU program, with its $2,000,000 (HB740_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt) annual cap, \"will be able to enroll about 17 properties per year\" (HB740_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_.PDF.txt)."
