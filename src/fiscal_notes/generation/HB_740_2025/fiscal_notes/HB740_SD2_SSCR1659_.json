  "overview": "The purpose of this Act is to establish an accessory dwelling unit financing and deed restriction program under the Hawaii housing finance and development corporation. [14] This program allocates funds to the counties for the purchase of equity in an accessory dwelling unit by the State and specifies eligible homeowners or homebuyers to finance construction costs, development costs, and non‑reoccurring closing costs. [14] [14] The Act sunsets on January 1, 2031, and appropriates moneys for infrastructure projects. [14]",
  "appropriations": "This measure has been amended by appropriating an unspecified amount, for fiscal year 2025-2026, into and out of the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund, to be expended by the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation for the purposes of infrastructure projects. [15] Your Committee recommends an appropriation amount of $20,000,000 (HB740_SD2_SSCR1659_.htm.txt) into the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund. [15] For the Accessory Dwelling Unit Financing and Deed Restriction Program, the corporation shall not allocate more than $2,000,000 (HB740_SD2_.HTM.txt) per year. [14]",
