  "overview": "The purpose and intent of this measure is to establish the Accessory Dwelling Unit Financing and Deed Restriction Program to allocate funds to the counties to provide grants to eligible homeowners or homebuyers to finance construction costs, development costs, and non-reoccurring closing costs associated with the construction of an accessory dwelling unit. The measure was amended, changing the program from a grant program to an equity purchase program. The bill requires the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation (HHFDC) to submit a report to the Legislature evaluating the program prior to the Regular Session of 2031, and the program is set to sunset on December 31, 2030.",
  "appropriations": "The Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation (HHFDC) shall not allocate more than $2,000,000 per year for the program between all counties (HB740). The funding source for the program is the Rental Housing Revolving Fund. The measure also authorizes the counties to use an unspecified percentage of awarded funds for administrative costs.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The measure was amended to be an equity purchase program, where a homeowner participating must repay HHFDC its prorated share of the appraised value of the completed accessory dwelling unit, with appreciation, within fifteen years or upon sale or transfer of the property, whichever occurs first. The total contribution amount from a county distributed per accessory dwelling unit shall not exceed eight percent of the appraised value of the property. The Legislature should study Maui County's deed restriction program, which is a similar grant program, before committing additional state funds.",
  "agency_impact": "The Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation (HHFDC) is tasked with allocating funds to the counties and submitting a report to the Legislature evaluating the program. The Office of Housing of the City and County of Honolulu noted existing challenges to implement this measure with regard to capacity, lack of positions and staff, and potential liability. Counties are authorized to use a percentage of awarded funds for administrative costs to carry out the program.",
  "economic_impact": "Incentivizing the construction of ADUs through the program could help increase housing stock that aligns with specific community needs while ensuring the units constructed are occupied by local workers. The measure aims to prevent the conversion of the units into vacation rentals or investment properties and reduce speculation in the State's housing market. Changing the program to an equity purchase program would allow the State to recover on its investment, thereby enabling the State to finance additional ADUs in the future.",
  "policy_impact": "This measure establishes the Accessory Dwelling Unit Financing and Deed Restriction Program, which was amended from a grant program to an equity purchase program. It modifies the funding source from the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund to the Rental Housing Revolving Fund. The program is set to sunset on December 31, 2030, and includes a Conveyance Tax exemption for applicable transactions beginning January 1, 2026.",
  "revenue_sources": "The source of funding for the program is the Rental Housing Revolving Fund. The measure was changed to an equity purchase program to allow the State to recover on its investment. A homeowner participating in the program is required to repay HHFDC its prorated share of the appraised value of the completed accessory dwelling unit, with appreciation, which will provide a return to the fund.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The measure specifies that the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation (HHFDC) shall not allocate more than $2,000,000 per year for the program between all counties (HB740). This annual cap on expenditures from the Rental Housing Revolving Fund will be in place until the program sunsets on December 31, 2030. Counties are authorized to use an unspecified percentage of these funds for administrative costs. The program requires HHFDC to submit a report to the Legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the Regular Session of 2031, indicating ongoing administrative responsibilities. The program was changed from a grant to an equity purchase program, requiring homeowners to repay HHFDC its prorated share of the property's value within fifteen years or upon sale. While this creates a long-term revenue stream, significant returns are not expected within the first six years. An exemption to the Conveyance Tax shall apply to taxable years beginning January 1, 2026, which will result in a revenue loss for the state during this period. The program prioritizes government employees as homeowners and tenants.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The measure changes the program from a grant program to an equity purchase program, which is intended to allow the State to recover on its investment. Participating homeowners are required to repay HHFDC its prorated share of the appraised value of the unit, with appreciation, which will generate revenue for the Rental Housing Revolving Fund over the long term. The exemption to the Conveyance Tax, effective for taxable years beginning January 1, 2026, will decrease state revenues.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The measure allocates funds to counties to provide to homeowners or homebuyers to finance construction costs, development costs, and non-reoccurring closing costs associated with the construction of an accessory dwelling unit. HHFDC shall not allocate more than $2,000,000 per year (HB740) from the Rental Housing Revolving Fund for this purpose. These funds represent a state investment in increasing the housing stock, rather than a direct capital expenditure on state-owned facilities or equipment.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The program is scheduled to sunset on December 31, 2030. However, the requirement for a homeowner to repay HHFDC its prorated share of the appraised value of the completed accessory dwelling unit continues for up to fifteen years or upon sale of the property. Therefore, the state will continue to receive repayments that replenish the Rental Housing Revolving Fund well after the program has ended.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "No previous fiscal note was provided."
