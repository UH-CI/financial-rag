  "overview": "This measure establishes the Accessory Dwelling Unit Financing and Deed Restriction Program to increase the state's housing stock. The program, administered by the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation (HHFDC) and the counties, will function as an equity purchase program to help finance ADU construction for eligible homeowners. The program requires HHFDC to submit an evaluation report to the Legislature before the 2031 session and is scheduled to sunset on December 31, 2030 (HB740).",
  "appropriations": "The bill authorizes the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation (HHFDC) to allocate funds to counties for the program. HHFDC shall not allocate more than $2,000,000 (HB740) per year for the program across all counties. The counties are also authorized to use an unspecified percentage of these awarded funds to cover administrative costs.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal approach is based on an equity purchase model rather than a grant program, allowing the state to recover its investment with appreciation. This model is influenced by existing state programs like the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund Equity Program, which enables the State to share in capital gains. The financial cap was set with the intent to study the effectiveness of a similar deed restriction program already initiated by Maui County before committing additional state funds.",
  "agency_impact": "The Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation (HHFDC) is tasked with managing the program, allocating up to $2,000,000 (HB740) annually to the counties, and submitting a report to the Legislature by 2031. County housing agencies will be responsible for local implementation, though concerns were raised by the City and County of Honolulu regarding its capacity, staffing, and potential liabilities. The measure requires an indemnification agreement to include counties and their officers.",
  "economic_impact": "The program is intended to increase the supply of lower-cost housing by incentivizing the construction of accessory dwelling units for local workers. By implementing deed restrictions, the measure aims to prevent these units from being used as vacation rentals, thereby reducing speculation in the housing market. The equity purchase model allows the state to recover its investment, with appreciation, which can be used to finance additional ADUs in the future.",
  "policy_impact": "This measure establishes a new statewide Accessory Dwelling Unit Financing and Deed Restriction Program, shifting its structure from a grant to an equity purchase model. It modifies state housing policy by creating a mechanism for the HHFDC to partner with counties to develop deed-restricted affordable housing. The program sunsets on December 31, 2030 (HB740) and includes a Conveyance Tax exemption for these properties beginning January 1, 2026 (HB740).",
  "revenue_sources": "The program will be funded from the Rental Housing Revolving Fund (HB740). The measure is designed for the state to recoup its investment, as homeowners participating in the program are required to repay HHFDC its prorated share of the appraised value, with appreciation. This repayment must occur within fifteen years or upon the sale or transfer of the property, whichever comes first.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The Accessory Dwelling Unit Financing and Deed Restriction Program is established with a sunset date of December 31, 2030 (HB740). The Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation (HHFDC) is authorized to allocate a maximum of $2,000,000 (HB740) per year from the Rental Housing Revolving Fund (HB740) to be distributed among all participating counties. This creates a potential six-year total allocation of up to $12,000,000 if the program starts in FY25. The program operates on an equity purchase basis, where the total county contribution for each unit cannot exceed eight percent of the property's appraised value. Homeowners must repay HHFDC's prorated share of the appraised value, including appreciation, within fifteen years or upon property sale, whichever is earlier. This repayment structure ensures that the initial investment is returned to the state, potentially with a gain, for future housing initiatives. Counties are permitted to use an unspecified portion of the funds for administrative expenses. Additionally, a Conveyance Tax exemption for these properties will take effect for taxable years beginning January 1, 2026 (HB740). HHFDC must also produce a program evaluation report for the Legislature before the 2031 session.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The program is structured as an equity purchase model, which is expected to have a positive or neutral impact on state operating revenue over the long term. The state's investment from the Rental Housing Revolving Fund (HB740) is designed to be recovered with appreciation upon the sale of the property or within fifteen years. These returned funds will replenish the Rental Housing Revolving Fund (HB740), allowing for future investments in housing.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "This measure does not involve direct state capital expenditures on facilities or infrastructure. Instead, it allocates funds from the Rental Housing Revolving Fund (HB740) to counties. These funds are then provided to eligible homeowners to finance the private construction costs of accessory dwelling units.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The program is scheduled to sunset on December 31, 2030 (HB740), ceasing new allocations. However, fiscal activities will continue as the state will receive repayments from homeowners for up to fifteen years from their entry into the program. These repayments, including the state's prorated share of appreciation, will be deposited back into the Rental Housing Revolving Fund (HB740) to support future housing projects.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "No previous fiscal note was provided in the context."
