  "overview": "HB740 establishes the Accessory Dwelling Unit Financing and Deed Restriction Program under the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation (HHFDC). The program aims to increase housing for local workers by allocating funds from the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund (DURF) to counties. Counties will then provide grants to homeowners to finance ADU construction and purchase perpetual deed restrictions, ensuring these units are occupied by qualified residents who work in Hawaii.",
  "appropriations": "This bill does not contain a specific appropriation amount. Instead, it authorizes the HHFDC to allocate an unspecified amount of funds from the existing Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund (DURF) to counties for the program's purposes. The funds are intended for homeowner grants and the county's purchase of deed restrictions.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal impact is based on the assumption that counties will apply for and receive funds from the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund to administer the program. Cost projections are indeterminate as they depend on the number of counties that participate and the volume of applications from eligible homeowners. The methodology involves HHFDC allocating funds from the DURF upon county request, with the overall financial impact tied to program demand.",
  "agency_impact": "The bill will have a significant operational impact on the HHFDC and participating counties. HHFDC will be responsible for program establishment, rulemaking, and managing fund allocations from the DURF. Counties will bear the primary administrative burden of processing applications, disbursing funds, purchasing deed restrictions, and ensuring long-term compliance through annual reporting and potential enforcement actions.",
  "economic_impact": "The program is expected to stimulate residential construction and increase the supply of rental housing for the local workforce. By deed-restricting the properties, the measure aims to ensure these units remain available for residents, potentially moderating rental costs and reducing the number of units used for short-term vacation rentals. This could provide cost savings for local workers seeking housing and contribute to overall community stability.",
  "policy_impact": "This act establishes a new housing policy that uses state funds to incentivize ADU construction while implementing permanent affordability and occupancy controls through deed restrictions. It amends Chapter 201H, HRS, to create the program, expands county powers under Chapter 46, HRS, and alters the authorized uses of the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund. The bill also creates new exemptions to the state conveyance tax, procurement code, and the rule against perpetuities for program participants.",
  "revenue_sources": "The primary funding source for the grants and deed restriction purchases is the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund (DURF). The bill also authorizes HHFDC and the counties to collect administrative fees, creating a secondary revenue stream to offset program costs. A potential tertiary source of revenue is the collection of fifty percent of a property's appreciation upon a non-compliant sale, which would be deposited back into the DURF.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The six-year fiscal impact is indeterminate and dependent on program uptake, but it has the potential to be significant. Assuming an average grant and deed restriction purchase cost of $150,000 per unit and 50 units funded statewide per year, the annual cost from the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund (DURF) would be approximately $7.5 million, totaling $45 million over six years. Administrative costs are also expected for both the HHFDC and participating counties. The HHFDC may require at least one FTE ($80,000 per year including fringe) to manage the program, adopt rules, and process county applications, totaling $480,000 over six years. Each participating county would likely need at least one FTE ($75,000 per year including fringe) to administer the program, monitor compliance for a growing number of units, and handle reporting, potentially costing $450,000 per county over six years. These administrative costs would be recurring and would increase if the program scales up. Therefore, the total estimated impact over six years could exceed $47 million, assuming all four counties participate and demand is consistent.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The bill is expected to have a mixed but likely minor impact on operating revenues. It authorizes HHFDC and counties to collect fees, which could offset some administrative expenses, though the amount is unknown. The state would experience a loss in conveyance tax revenue from the sale of any property with a deed restriction purchased under this program.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "This bill is not expected to have a direct capital expenditure impact on the State or counties. The program provides grants to private homeowners for the construction of accessory dwelling units on their property. These expenditures are private capital investments rather than public works or government facility projects.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The fiscal implications after six years are expected to be ongoing and potentially increasing. The program is established without a sunset clause, implying continued annual allocations from the DURF based on demand. The administrative responsibility on counties to monitor compliance for all deed-restricted properties will be cumulative, likely requiring sustained or increased staffing levels as the number of units in the program grows over time.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "No previous fiscal note was provided for comparison. This is the initial fiscal analysis for this bill."
