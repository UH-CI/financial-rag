  "overview": "The purpose of this Act is to establish an accessory dwelling unit financing and deed restriction program under the Hawaii housing finance and development corporation. [1] This program will allocate funds to the counties to provide grants to eligible homeowners or homebuyers to finance costs associated with the construction of an accessory dwelling unit and purchase deed restrictions on such property. [1] The deed restriction shall be recorded against the property and shall run with the land in perpetuity, binding all future owners, successors, and assigns. [1]",
  "appropriations": "This bill does not specify an appropriation amount. [1] Instead, the corporation may allocate funds from the dwelling unit revolving fund established under section 201H-191 to a county to provide grants and purchase deed restrictions. [1] Upon application by a county, the corporation shall allocate a dollar amount necessary for a county to carry out the program's purposes. [1]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal impact of this measure is indeterminate as the bill does not provide financial projections or specify appropriation amounts. [1] The program's costs are assumed to be funded by the existing dwelling unit revolving fund. [1] The methodology for funding is demand-driven, based on applications from counties for a necessary dollar amount to implement the program. [1]",
  "agency_impact": "The Hawaii housing finance and development corporation is responsible for establishing the accessory dwelling unit financing and deed restriction program and allocating funds from the dwelling unit revolving fund. [1] Counties shall be responsible for validating the evidence and ensuring compliance with this subpart and shall report any property not in compliance to the corporation. [1] The corporation and each county may adopt rules pursuant to chapter 91 for the purposes of this subpart. [1]",
  "economic_impact": "The purpose of this Act is to promote the development of additional housing while securing that housing for local residents working in Hawaii. [1] Property sold for which a county has purchased a deed restriction pursuant to this subpart shall be exempt from chapter 247, the conveyance tax. [1] If a property with a deed restriction is sold to a nonresident, the corporation shall be entitled to fifty per cent of appreciation at the time of sale, to be collected by the corporation and placed in the dwelling unit revolving fund. [1]",
  "policy_impact": "This Act establishes a new accessory dwelling unit financing and deed restriction program by amending Chapter 201H, Hawaii Revised Statutes. [1] It also amends section 46-15.2, Hawaii Revised Statutes, to grant counties the power to purchase deed restrictions on housing properties from eligible homeowners and homebuyers. [1] Furthermore, the measure amends the state procurement code to exempt the purchase of these deed restrictions and amends the authorized uses of the dwelling unit revolving fund to include this program. [1] [1]",
  "revenue_sources": "The corporation may allocate funds from the dwelling unit revolving fund established under section 201H-191 to a county. [1] The corporation and each county may establish, revise, charge, and collect fees, premiums, and impose costs as necessary, reasonable, or convenient to effectuate the purposes of this subpart. [1] Additional revenue for the dwelling unit revolving fund may be generated from fifty per cent of appreciation at the time of sale if a property is sold to a nonresident. [1]",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The fiscal implications of this measure, which takes effect on July 1, 2025, are indeterminate and dependent on county and homeowner participation. [1] The program will be funded by allocations from the existing dwelling unit revolving fund, and the impact on this fund will vary based on the number and amount of county applications. [1] Counties will incur ongoing administrative costs for validating evidence and ensuring compliance, as well as processing annual reports from property owners. [1] Counties may contract with non-government persons or entities to ensure compliance, creating a recurring operational expense. [1] Both the corporation and counties may incur administrative costs associated with rulemaking. [1] Potential revenue for the dwelling unit revolving fund could be generated if the corporation collects fifty per cent of appreciation on properties sold to nonresidents. [1] Any moneys allocated to a county that are not expended within one year of receipt shall be returned to the corporation and placed in the dwelling unit revolving fund. [1] As the deed restrictions are in perpetuity, counties will face long-term administrative and monitoring responsibilities. [1] The bill does not authorize new positions, so the workload will be absorbed by existing staff. [1] This will result in an indeterminate loss of conveyance tax revenue for the State. [1]",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "Operating revenues for the corporation and counties may increase, as both entities may establish, revise, charge, and collect fees, premiums, and impose costs. [1] The dwelling unit revolving fund may receive additional revenue if the corporation collects fifty per cent of appreciation from the sale of properties to nonresidents. [1] The State will experience an indeterminate loss of revenue due to the new exemption from the conveyance tax for properties sold with a deed restriction purchased under this program. [1]",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "This measure does not authorize any capital expenditures. [1] The funds from the dwelling unit revolving fund are intended for grants to eligible homeowners or homebuyers and to purchase deed restrictions. [1] No investments in facilities, equipment, or other capital infrastructure are anticipated as a result of this bill. [1]",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "Because the deed restrictions run with the land in perpetuity, counties will have permanent, ongoing administrative costs related to compliance monitoring and the processing of annual reports. [1] The long-term fiscal impact on the dwelling unit revolving fund is indeterminate and will be dependent on continued program participation by counties and homeowners. [1] The loss of state conveyance tax revenue from the sale of these properties will be ongoing. [1]",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "No previous fiscal note was provided for comparison. [1]"
