  "overview": "The purpose of this Act is to establish an accessory dwelling unit financing and deed restriction program under the Hawaii housing finance and development corporation. [1] The program allocates funds from the dwelling unit revolving fund to counties to provide grants to eligible homeowners or homebuyers to finance costs associated with the construction of an accessory dwelling unit and to purchase deed restrictions on such property. [1] The bill also establishes annual reporting requirements for property owners to verify compliance with the deed restrictions. [1]",
  "appropriations": "This bill does not contain a specific appropriation amount. [1] Instead, the measure authorizes the Hawaii housing finance and development corporation to allocate funds from the dwelling unit revolving fund established under section 201H-191 to a county. [1] The corporation shall allocate a dollar amount necessary for a county to provide grants and purchase deed restrictions. [1]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal impact of this measure is indeterminate as it depends on the number of counties that apply for funds and the number of eligible homeowners or homebuyers who participate in the program. [1] Costs will be driven by the amount of funds allocated from the dwelling unit revolving fund for grants and deed restriction purchases. [1] The bill does not provide data to project participation rates or the total allocation required from the revolving fund. [1]",
  "agency_impact": "This measure establishes an accessory dwelling unit financing and deed restriction program within the Hawaii housing finance and development corporation, which will be responsible for allocating funds and adopting rules. [1] Counties will be responsible for applying for funds, ensuring compliance with program requirements, and handling annual reporting from property owners. [1] Counties may contract with non-government persons or entities to ensure compliance with this subpart. [1]",
  "economic_impact": "The legislature believes that it is important to promote the development of additional housing while securing that housing for local residents working in Hawaii. [1] Property sold for which a county has purchased a deed restriction pursuant to this subpart shall be exempt from chapter 247, the conveyance tax. [1] If a property with a deed restriction is sold to a nonresident, the corporation shall be entitled to fifty per cent of appreciation at the time of sale. [1]",
  "policy_impact": "This Act establishes a new accessory dwelling unit financing and deed restriction program by adding a new subpart to chapter 201H, Hawaii Revised Statutes. [1] It amends section 201H-191, Hawaii Revised Statutes, to authorize the use of the dwelling unit revolving fund for the administration of and purchase of deed restrictions as part of the program. [1] The measure also amends sections related to county powers, the procurement code, conveyance tax, and the rule against perpetuities to support the program's implementation. [1]",
  "revenue_sources": "The program is funded by the dwelling unit revolving fund. [1] The corporation may allocate funds from the dwelling unit revolving fund established under section 201H-191 to a county. [1] Additionally, if a property is sold in non-compliance, fifty per cent of appreciation at the time of sale is to be collected by the corporation and placed in the dwelling unit revolving fund. [1]",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The six-year fiscal impact of this measure is indeterminate. [1] The Hawaii housing finance and development corporation may allocate funds from the dwelling unit revolving fund to counties that apply for the program. [1] Counties may then provide grants to eligible homeowners or homebuyers to finance construction costs, development costs, and non-reoccurring closing costs, and purchase deed restrictions. [1] The amount of funds expended will depend on the level of participation by counties and homeowners each year. [1] There will be ongoing administrative costs for the corporation and participating counties to manage the program, ensure compliance, and process annual reports. [1] The state will experience an indeterminate loss of conveyance tax revenue, as properties with a county-owned deed restriction will be exempt from the tax imposed by section 247-1. [1] There may be some offsetting revenue if the corporation collects fifty per cent of appreciation from non-compliant sales. [1] Any moneys allocated to a county that are not expended within one year must be returned to the dwelling unit revolving fund. [1] The deed restrictions established under this program are intended to run with the land in perpetuity. [1] No specific staffing increases are mentioned in the bill. [1]",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "This measure will negatively impact state revenues through an exemption from the conveyance tax for any property sold with a county-owned deed restriction purchased pursuant to this program. [1] There is a potential for a positive impact on the dwelling unit revolving fund's revenue. [1] If a property with a deed restriction is sold to a nonresident, the corporation is entitled to fifty per cent of the appreciation at the time of sale, which is to be deposited into the dwelling unit revolving fund. [1]",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "This measure does not appropriate funds for state capital expenditures. [1] The program provides grants to eligible homeowners or homebuyers to finance construction costs, development costs, and nonâ€‘reoccurring closing costs associated with the construction of an accessory dwelling unit. [1] These expenditures would be made from the dwelling unit revolving fund to counties and subsequently to private individuals, not for state-owned capital assets. [1]",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The fiscal implications of this program are expected to be ongoing. [1] A deed restriction shall be recorded against the property and shall run with the land in perpetuity, binding all future owners, successors, and assigns. [1] This indicates long-term administrative and compliance monitoring costs for counties, as well as a recurring loss of conveyance tax revenue for the state. [1]",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "No previous fiscal note was provided."
