    "response_text": "{\n\"overview\": \"The purpose of this measure is to establish the Accessory Dwelling Unit Financing and Deed Restriction Program to allocate funds to the counties to provide grants to eligible homeowners or homebuyers to finance construction costs, development costs, and non-reoccurring closing costs associated with the construction of an accessory dwelling unit and purchase deed restrictions on the property (HB740_HD2_HSCR1128_). The Hawai‘i Housing Finance and Development Corporation supports the program as a way to increase the inventory of rental units in the State, as the upfront costs of designing and permitting an ADU are barriers for many homeowners (HB740_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_). The program would be funded through the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund (HB740_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_).\",\n\"appropriations\": \"This bill would enable the Hawai‘i Housing Finance and Development Corporation to allocate funds from the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund (DURF) to the counties for the purposes of the program (HB740_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_). No specific appropriation amounts are detailed in the provided documents. The City and County of Honolulu notes that the bill's language is unclear if a portion of the DURF funds provided to the counties could be used for administrative funding purposes (HB740_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_).\",\n\"assumptions_and_methodology\": \"The provided documents do not specify the assumptions or methodology used for fiscal projections. The Department of Taxation estimates no material revenue impact for the bill (HB740_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_). The City and County of Honolulu raises concerns that there is no dedicated funding source to establish and stand-up full-time equivalent positions to administer, train staff, and enforce the program (HB740_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_).\",\n\"agency_impact\": \"The Office of Housing for the City and County of Honolulu has concerns about \\\"capacity challenges, lack of positions and staff, potential impacts to real property tax revenues, eligibility criteria, implementation timelines, enforceability, and potential liability associated with the bill in its current form\\\" (HB740_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_). The bill requires counties to be responsible for administering the program, but the City states it \\\"does not currently have the capacity to administer this program\\\" and would need funding to onboard new staff, train existing staff, or contract a third-party (HB740_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_). The Department of Taxation requests that section 6 take effect on January 1, 2026, to allow for form and instruction changes necessary to implement the proposed conveyance tax exemption (HB740_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_).\",\n\"economic_impact\": \"The Hawai‘i Housing Finance and Development Corporation supports the program as \\\"a way to increase the inventory of rental units in the State\\\" (HB740_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_). Testimony suggests the program will help address financial barriers to ADU construction, as estimates for construction are about \\\"$250-$350 per square feet\\\" (HB740_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_). According to testimony from the Council for Native Hawaiian Advancement, median annual earnings for Native Hawaiians fall below $40,000 (HB740_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_) for full-time work, and the program aims to create housing solutions that prioritize residents.\",\n\"policy_impact\": \"Section 6 of the measure amends section 247-3, Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS), to \\\"exempt from conveyance tax any property with a county-owned deed restriction\\\" and also exempts \\\"any document or instrument conveying a county-owned deed restriction\\\" (HB740_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_). The bill has a \\\"defective effective date of July 1, 3000\\\" (HB740_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_). The bill also creates an immunity for State officers, employees, and agents, but leaves out county officers, employees, and agents, who should be provided the same statutory protections if they are to administer the program (HB740_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_).\",\n\"revenue_sources\": \"The bill allows the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation (HHFDC) to \\\"allocate funds from the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund (DURF) to the counties\\\" for the program's purposes (HB740_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_). The bill also allows counties to establish and collect fees and premiums to cover administrative costs (HB740_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_). However, the City and County of Honolulu notes that \\\"there is no dedicated funding source to establish and stand-up full-time equivalent (FTE) positions to administer, train staff, and enforce the program\\\" (HB740_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_).\",\n\"six_year_fiscal_implications\": \"The City and County of Honolulu expresses concerns about the long-term fiscal implications of administering the program.

These responsibilities include meeting \\\"annual reporting requirements that will continue for the length of recorded deed restrictions, potentially into perpetuity, even if program funding is terminated at some point in the future\\\" (HB740_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_). The Hawai‘i Association of REALTORS® also raises concerns that the deed restrictions are in perpetuity, which could be problematic for land use planning as communities change over time (HB740_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_). The City and County of Honolulu is not currently in the business of purchasing and owning deed restrictions and would require appropriate funding and time to either onboard new staff with the required expertise, train staff, or contract out to a third-party (HB740_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_). The skills required to negotiate the price of a deed restriction on a case-by-case basis would also incur extensive costs (HB740_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_).\",\n\"operating_revenue_impact\": \"The Department of Taxation (DOTAX) \\\"estimates no material revenue impact for this bill\\\" despite the new conveyance tax exemption (HB740_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_).

The Hawai‘i Association of REALTORS® also notes that having deed restrictions on a property \\\"in perpetuity can be problematic\\\" (HB740_HD2_TESTIMONY_FIN_02-25-25_).
