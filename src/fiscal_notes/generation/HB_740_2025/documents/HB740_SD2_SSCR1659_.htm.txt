RE:
H.B. No. 740
H.D. 2
S.D. 2
Honorable Ronald D. Kouchi
President of the Senate
Thirty-Third State Legislature
Regular Session of 2025
State of Hawaii
Sir:
Your Committee on
Ways and Means, to which was referred H.B. No. 740, H.D. 2,
S.D. 1, entitled:
"A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO HOUSING,"
begs leave to report as follows:
The
purpose and intent of this measure is to establish an accessory dwelling unit
financing and deed restriction program under the Hawaii Housing Finance and
Development Corporation.
Your Committee
received written comments in support of this measure from the Hawaii Housing
Finance and Development Corporation, Catholic Charities Hawaii, Hawaii
Appleseed Center for Law and Economic Justice, Hawaii Community Foundation,
Holomua Collaborative, Hope Services Hawaii, HPM Building Supply, Mana Up, The
Chamber of Commerce Hawaii, Title Guaranty of Hawaii, We Are One, Inc., YIMBY
Hawaii, and eight individuals.
Your Committee
received written comments on this measure from the Department of Taxation and Hawaii
Association of REALTORS.
Your Committee
finds that increasing the supply of accessory dwelling units is an important
strategy to help address the shortage of rental housing units in Hawaii.
Your Committee further finds that the costs
of constructing accessory dwelling units can be prohibitive for homeowners.
Your Committee believes that providing
financial assistance for these projects will encourage homeowners to build
accessory dwelling units and thereby help increase the rental housing
supply.
In addition, restricting the
occupancy of the properties to owner-occupants or tenants who work at or are
retired from work at a Hawaii business will ensure that the benefits of the
assistance program continue to accrue to the Hawaii workforce housing supply.
Your Committee has
amended this measure by appropriating an unspecified amount, for fiscal year
2025-2026, into and out of the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund, to be expended by
the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation for the purposes of infrastructure
projects.
Your Committee
recommends an appropriation amount of $20,000,000 into the Dwelling Unit
Revolving Fund.
As affirmed by the
record of votes of the members of your Committee on Ways and Means that is
attached to this report, your Committee is in accord with the intent and
purpose of H.B. No. 740, H.D. 2, S.D. 1, as amended herein, and
recommends that it pass Third Reading in the form attached hereto as H.B.
No. 740, H.D. 2, S.D. 2.
Respectfully submitted on behalf
of the members of the Committee on Ways and Means,
