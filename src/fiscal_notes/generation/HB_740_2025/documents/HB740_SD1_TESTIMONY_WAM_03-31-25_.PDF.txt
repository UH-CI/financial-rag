State Capitol, Room 211 
In consideration of 
H.B. 740 HD2 SD1 
RELATING TO HOUSING 
Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki, and members of the Committee.   
HHFDC supports HB 740 HD2 SD1, which establishes the Accessory Dwelling Unit 
(ADU) Financing and Deed Restriction Program to allocate funds to the counties for the 
purchase of equity in an ADU by the State. It also specifies eligible homeowners or 
homebuyers for the Program to finance construction costs, development costs, and 
non-reoccurring closing costs associated with the construction of an ADU and purchase 
deed restrictions on the property. Sunsets 1/01/2031. 
The upfront costs of designing and permitting an ADU are barriers for many 
homeowners. HHFDC supports the ADU Financing and Deed Restriction program as a 
way to increase the inventory of rental units in the State.  In addition, the deed 
restriction program will create an inventory of homes for local residents, stabilize home 
prices, and reduce speculation in our housing market.  
We do note that the ceiling of $2,000,000 per year will limit the reach of the program.  
Assuming that the average value of participating properties is $1,000,000, the cost of 
the deed restriction is $80,000, and $40,000 of equity is provided for each ADU, the 
program will be able to enroll about 17 properties per year. 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify on this bill.

TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF HB 740 HD2 SD!:  RELATING TO HOUSING 
 
TO:  
Senate Committee on Ways and Means 
 
FROM: 
Tina Andrade, President and CEO, Catholic Charities Hawai`i 
 
Hearing: 
Monday, March 31, 2025; 10:02 AM; CR 211 & via Videoconference 
 
Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki, and Members, Committee on Ways and Means: 
 
Catholic Charities Hawai`i supports HB 740 HD2 SD1, which establishes the 
Accessory Dwelling Unit Financing and Deed Restriction Program.  It allocates funds to 
the counties for grants to eligible homeowners/homebuyers to develop accessory 
dwelling units and to purchase deed restrictions on these properties. 
 
Catholic Charities Hawai‘i (CCH), a community-based organization, has provided social 
services in Hawai‘i for over 77 years, assisting 40,000 people annually. Our services 
target the most vulnerable in Hawai‘i, including elders, veterans, children, families, 
houseless individuals, and immigrants.  We have a long history of addressing affordable 
housing and homelessness.     
Hawai‘i is facing a severe housing crisis, with an urgent need to provide more homes for 
local residents—especially our workforce—without unnecessary delays. Accessory 
Dwelling Units (ADUs) present a practical and immediate solution to increase housing 
supply efficiently while ensuring affordability for local families. By utilizing existing 
residential properties, ADUs can be built faster and at lower costs compared to large-
scale developments, helping to alleviate housing shortages more quickly. 
This bill strengthens collaboration with each county, allowing for tailored solutions that 
address the unique housing needs of different communities. Localized decision-making 
ensures that ADU policies align with infrastructure capacity, neighborhood character, 
and affordability goals, making housing more accessible to those who need it most. 
Supporting this legislation is a crucial step toward expanding housing opportunities, 
stabilizing our communities, and keeping Hawai‘i’s residents in Hawai‘i. 
Implementing deed restrictions on these units will ensure they remain available to local 
workers. We support the Legislature’s efforts to ensure that government-assisted ADUs 
actually house bona fide Hawai‘i residents, including kūpuna and individuals with 
disabilities. 
Catholic Charities Hawai`i supports the intent of this bill and urges your support. 
 
If you have any questions, please contact our Legislative Liaison, Betty Lou Larson, at 
(808) 527-4813.  

 
OUR MISSION 
To support and advance public policies 
that make Hawai‘i affordable for all 
working families. 
OUR VISION 
Collaborative, sustainable, and 
evidence-based public policies that 
create a diverse and sustainable 
Hawai‘i economy, an abundance of 
quality job opportunities, and a future 
where all working families living in 
Hawai‘i can thrive.

HB 740 SD1, Relating to Housing 
Hearing Date and Time: March 31, 2025, 10:02am (Room 211) 
Re: 
 
 
Testimony of Holomua Collaborative – Support 
 
Aloha Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki, and Members of the committee: 
 
Mahalo for hearing HB740 SD1, Relating to Housing, and for the opportunity to submit 
testimony on this bill. Holomua Collaborative supports the intent of this bill and 
would like to see it move to conference to find ways to maximize its impact. 
 
Hawai‘i remains in a housing crisis. Skyrocketing home prices leave many local 
families struggling to secure safe, attainable places to live. The median home price in 
Hawai‘i now exceeds $800,000—an impossible amount for most residents. As a result, 
many local families are being forced to leave in search of affordable living options 
elsewhere. Between July 2022 and July 2023 alone, an average of twelve people left 
Hawai‘i every day.1 More Native Hawaiians now live outside Hawai‘i than within it. This 
is a loss of our culture, traditions, and the essence of what makes Hawai‘i home. 
 
In October 2024, a survey2 gathering information about the day-to-day financial 
experience of local workers was released and it suggests this growing crisis has the 
potential to reach staggering levels. When nearly 1,500 local workers were asked if 
they may need to move to a less expensive state, only thirty-one percent answered a 
definitive “no,” while sixty-nine percent said “yes” or “unsure.” And nearly two-thirds 
of the respondents said the cost of housing was the primary impact on their cost of 
living in Hawai‘i. Each local worker and family we lose to the continent contributes to 
a loss of our economy, our culture, and our family. 
 
The Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) Financing and Deed Restriction Program 
established by this bill is a voluntary initiative that would create a dedicated housing 
supply for local residents by empowering the Counties to purchase deed restrictions 
on properties that require occupants to live and work in Hawai‘i in return for the 
construction costs of an ADU.

Holomua Collaborative believes that deed restrictions are a useful tool to help secure 
long-term workforce housing that will help keep local families in Hawai‘i.  
 
However, we also believe that certain aspects of the SD1 limit the scope and impact of 
the program from meaningfully impacting the housing market, including the equity 
loan program and the required prioritization of government employees. Moving this 
bill to the next phase of the legislative session will allow supporters to work with the 
subject matter chairs to find language that will most positively impact our local 
housing market.

RE: Support for HB740 HD2 SD1 with amendments  
 
Hawai‘i State Capitol, Conference Room 211 & Via Videoconference 
Monday, March 31, 2025, 10:02AM 
 
 
Aloha Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki, and members of the committee: 
My name is Patrick Hurney and I am writing in support of HB740 HD2 SD1 with amendments, which would 
establish the Accessory Dwelling Unit Deed Restriction Program to create a protected market of housing 
specifically for Hawaii workforce residents. 
I encourage the committee to revert HB740 HD2 SD1 back to the language in HB740 HD2. 
This bill provides grants for ADU construction while securing long-term affordability through deed restrictions, 
creating immediate housing opportunities and preserving them for Hawaii’s workforce. Many homeowners looking 
to build ADUs to ease our housing crisis struggle with financial barriers. This grant program will help more 
moderate-income homeowners contribute to housing solutions. 
This program addresses a core driver of Hawaii's housing crisis: the competition between local families and 
outside investors that has made home prices completely disconnected from local incomes. 
 
Only 20% of Hawaii residents can afford a median-priced home 
 
Outside buyers spend on average 46% more than local residents on home purchases 
 
Median housing costs are 2.7 times the national level 
 
Housing costs has been cited as the primary reason for locals leaving Hawaii, with a mass exodus of 
thousands of local families leaving 
By restricting occupancy and sale of housing to local workforce requirements, we create a dedicated housing 
stock that is tied to local wages and protected to housing price inflation caused by competition from non local 
investors. The deed restriction runs with the land forever. When selling, homeowners must sell to eligible buyers 
as defined by the deed restriction (local workforce). This restriction transfers to all future owners, so any new 
owner will need to follow the limitations set by the deed restriction.  
 
 
This means a dedicated stock of housing for our local workforce families remains stable and accessible 
for future generations.

Many longtime local landowners want to preserve housing for locals, yet face increasing financial pressure to sell 
to outside investors. This program offers a practical solution while also helping to increase our housing stock. 
Offering financial incentives to increase ADU supply will provide local families with more versatile housing options; 
ones that offer smaller, more practical homes for local residents, as opposed to the luxury housing options 
currently available in our private housing market. Because of the smaller nature of ADUs, these units are typically 
more affordable and work for a variety of housing situations that fit local needs such as:  
 
Starter homes for young adults and young families 
 
Housing for Kupuna to live nearby family members and community networks 
 
Independent spaces for individuals who can’t afford their place home yet but live in overcrowded housing 
situations 
I also strongly encourage the committee to amend the bill to include language from HB739 HD2 which 
would have established the Kamaʻāina Homes Deed Restriction Program - offering similar incentives to deed 
restrict and preserve our existing housing stock for Hawai‘i’s workforce residents and families.  
This program would be especially helpful in areas with limited infrastructure capacity or restricted expansion. 
Without the ability to increase housing supply, preserving our current stock from entering the investment market 
becomes paramount.  
The contents of this program would appeal to homeowners who are willing to reduce future potential home sales 
to ensure homes are in local hands forever or don’t wish to sell their homes yet, but need access to funds. These 
funds could support households with expenses related to down payments, mortgages, education and business 
financing. 
By separating our local housing market from the global investment market, we can begin to address the massive 
gap between local incomes and housing costs that is forcing families to leave Hawaii. 
I strongly urge the committee to pass HB740 HD2 to create housing stability for Hawaii's families.

PLACE: 
Conference Room 211 
 
 
The Hawaiʻi Community Foundation (HCF) supports the intent of HB 740 HD2 SD1, Relating 
to Housing, which establishes the Accessory Dwelling Unit Financing and Deed Restriction 
Program. Deed restriction programs have the potential to address a weakness in the current 
housing system, and HCF encourages further collaboration on this bill at conference. 
 
Housing is a priority area within HCF’s CHANGE Framework under the “C” sector of 
Community Centered Economy. Per UHERO, “median housing costs in Hawaii are more than 
2.7 times the national level” 1  and median rents are the highest in the country.2  ALICE 
families are more vulnerable because of our current housing market. 
   
The demand for attainable local housing currently enveloping Hawaiʻi is at crisis levels. Too 
many people who do not live or work in Hawai‘i are owning and driving up the costs of our 
housing market, which contributes to a record outmigration of local residents. The agony of 
this dynamic punctuated by the fact that more Hawaiians now live out of Hawaiʻi than in 
Hawaiʻi.   
 
While eƯorts to improve housing have shown progress, it is evident that the current 
perspectives and eƯorts need to be expanded, and new creative solutions must be adopted. 
Hyper prioritization of major oƯ-site infrastructure improvements that can eƯectuate 
housing, broad-based collaboration and regulatory reform are more critical now than ever.

We support the creation of the Accessory Dwelling Unit Financing and Deed Restriction 
Program. The program envisioned by this bill can simultaneously stimulate an increase of our 
housing supply while also dedicate units to be used for local workforce housing. 
 
Kamaʻāina want to stay in Hawaiʻi and deed restrictions can open that door and provide that 
hope. There is universal agreement that locals need more places to call home. Homes must 
be aƯordable so residents will be free from the pressure of leaving the island. Due to the 
importance of this challenge, more work can be done to evaluate the diƯerent versions of HB 
740 and ﬁnd common ground on the best overall deed restriction program that will serve 
current and future homeowners in Hawai‘i.

Tes$mony in support of HB 740 SD1, Rela$ng to Housing 
Aloha Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki, and Committee Members, 
We support the intent of HB 740 SD1, Relating to Housing, which would establish the Accessory 
Dwelling Unit Financing and Deed RestricKon Program to place voluntary deed restricKons on 
homes and accessory dwelling units (ADU) that will be dedicated for local working residents in 
exchange for the ﬁnancing the construcKon of an ADU.  
Title Guaranty of Hawai‘i is the oldest and largest Ktle company in the state. We have been 
owned and operated by a kama‘āina family since 1896 and we are proud to employ over 250 
residents who work in our branches across the state. As an organizaKon that has worked for 
over a century to help connect local families with housing, we see ﬁrsthand the economic shiZ 
that is prevenKng local families from achieving the dream of homeownership. 
The Accessory Dwelling Unit Financing and Deed RestricKon Program is an innovaKve proposal 
to create a new pool of residenKal real estate that is restricted to local residents while building 
new housing units. This will enable locals to get into Hawaii’s Kght housing market by restricKng 
housing stock for local families and promoKng a local workforce. While the intent behind the 
bill is laudatory, we believe that the scope and impact of the new program in the SD1 is limited 
when compared to the previous draZs.  
The Accessory Dwelling Unit Financing and Deed RestricKon Program created by HB 740 SD1 is 
an original solution that invests in our community and culture, and with improvements in 
conference, this bill could help keep local residents in Hawai‘i.

HB740 SD1, Relating to Housing 
March 31, 2025, 10:02am 
Testimony of HPM Building Supply in Support 
Dear Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki, and Committee Members: 
I would like to submit this testimony supporting the intent of HB740 SD1, Relating to Housing. The 
purpose of HB740 SD1 is to create a dedicated local housing market through the establishment of the 
Accessory Dwelling Unit Financing and Deed Restriction Program. 
HPM Building Supply is a 100% employee-owned company serving Hawaii's home improvement 
market and building industry for over 100 years since 1921. With 18 locations across Hawai‘i and 
Washington State, HPM offers various services and products, including retail stores, building supply 
and lumber yards, home design centers, drafting and design services, and manufacturing facilities. 
HPM is dedicated to enhancing homes, improving lives, and transforming communities.   
A significant portion of our workforce consists of skilled tradespeople like carpenters, electricians, and 
plumbers, all of whom are integral to the construction process. However, as housing prices rise and 
rental prices soar, these workers are forced to leave the state in search of more affordable living 
situations. The result is a shortage of skilled labor in the construction sector, leading to delays and 
higher costs for homeowners and developers alike. The Accessory Dwelling Unit Financing and Deed 
Restriction Program offers a solution to this by ensuring that local workers have a place to live in the 
same communities where they work. 
Deed restrictions are a helpful way to protect long-term workforce housing in Hawai‘i, some parts of 
HB 740 SD1’s approach will help stabilize the housing market by giving local workers a fighting 
chance in a competitive market in which wealthier non-residents often have an advantage. However, 
other parts of this draft might limit its overall effectiveness. Moving this bill forward will give 
policymakers and advocates the opportunity to create a more inclusive solution to our housing crisis. 
I ask for your support of HB740 SD1, as it provides the foundation for a more robust, locally 
employed, and efficient building industry that will meet the needs of Hawaii’s growing population. 
Sincerely, 
Jason Fujimoto

Statement of 
Meli James and Brittany Heyd 
Cofounders 
Mana Up  
 
HB740 SD1, Relating to Housing 
 
Aloha Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki, and committee members, 
 
We support the intent of HB740 SD1, which establishes the Accessory Dwelling Unit Financing and Deed 
Restriction Program to provide voluntary deed restrictions to willing eligible homeowners and 
homebuyers who agree to limit the use of their property for local working occupants in exchange for 
funding to help the construction of an accessory dwelling unit (ADU). 
 
Mana Up is a statewide initiative that helps provide entrepreneurs in Hawai‘i with the resources and tools 
to grow their business and scale globally. As these entrepreneurs continue to grow, they also help 
contribute to our expanding our local economy. As part of our mission, we aim to sustain the local 
economy through economic diversification, local job creation, community giveback, investment, and a 
regenerative culture of entrepreneurship – providing a better future for generations to come here in 
Hawai‘i. To keep these types of entrepreneurs in Hawai’i and even expand our entrepreneurial 
ecosystem, though, these entrepreneurs need a place to live that they can afford.  
 
We repeatedly hear from our entrepreneurs about the difficultly they have in finding attainable housing 
that provides them the safety and security necessary to focus on their business and family. Local 
entrepreneurs want to create and expand their business in Hawai‘i, but far too often feel that opportunities 
for housing and business are better on the continent. 
 
Creating a dedicated housing stock for our local workforce will help our families have security as they 
navigate the difficult economic conditions that face the State. We see deed restrictions as a crucial tool 
for keeping affordable housing available for local workers, so that families can keep living in Hawai‘i. 
However, some parts of this draft, like the equity loan requirements and the focus on prioritizing 
government employees, limit how effective the program can be. Moving this bill forward will give everyone 
a chance to work with lawmakers to improve its wording and boost its positive effects on our housing 
market. 
 
 
Sincerely,

RE: HB740 HD2 SD1 Relating to Housing 
Aloha e Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki, and Members of the Committee:  
My name is Sherry Menor, President and CEO of the Chamber of Commerce Hawaii ("The 
Chamber"). The Chamber supports House Bill 740 House Draft 2 Senate Draft 1 (HB740 HD2 
SD1), which establishes the Accessory Dwelling Unit Financing and Deed Restriction Program 
to allocate funds to the counties for the purchase of equity in an accessory dwelling unit by the 
State. Specifies eligible homeowners or homebuyers for the Program to finance construction 
costs, development costs, and non-reoccurring closing costs associated with the construction of 
an accessory dwelling unit and purchase deed restrictions on the property. 
 
HB740 HD2 SD1 aligns with our 2030 Blueprint for Hawaii: An Economic Action Plan, 
specifically under the policy pillar for Business Services. This bill promotes policies that drive 
economic growth, enhance workforce opportunities, and improve the quality of life for Hawaii's 
reside  
 
Hawaii urgently needs more affordable housing options that support the state’s growing 
workforce. This measure addresses that need by establishing an accessory dwelling unit (ADU) 
financing and deed restriction program under the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development 
Corporation. Through the proposed program, eligible homeowners and homebuyers may 
receive financial support to build ADUs, provided they commit to placing deed restrictions that 
require occupancy by residents employed in Hawaii. By prioritizing government employees and 
ensuring perpetual owner‑occupant or locally employed tenants, the measure safeguards these 
additional housing units for the local workforce. 
 
The program establishes clear criteria for distributing state funds, imposing deed restrictions, 
and overseeing compliance at both the county and state levels, thereby offering a transparent 
and sustainable approach to expanding Hawaii’s housing supply. The Chamber supports this 
legislation because it helps address the State’s housing shortage while ensuring that new units 
remain accessible to those who live and work in Hawaii. 
 
The Chamber of Commerce Hawaii is the state’s leading business advocacy organization, 
dedicated to improving Hawaii’s economy and securing Hawaii’s future for growth and 
opportunity. Our mission is to foster a vibrant economic climate. As such, we support initiatives 
and policies that align with the 2030 Blueprint for Hawaii that create opportunities to strengthen 
overall competitiveness, improve the quantity and skills of available workforce, diversify the 
economy, and build greater local wealth.  
 
We respectfully ask to pass House Bill 740 House Draft 2 Senate Draft 1. Thank you for the 
opportunity to testify

RE: SUPPORT for HB 740 HD2 SD1 - RELATING TO HOUSING 
 
Aloha Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki, and Members of the Committee, 
 
On behalf of Hawai‘i YIMBY, we support the intent of HB 740 HD2 SD1 and encourage 
further collaboration on the bill in conference committee. This bill would establish the 
Additional Dwelling Unit Financing and Deed Restriction Program, funding and allowing 
counties to purchase voluntary deed restrictions from eligible homeowners and 
homebuyers. Those eligible may use the funds towards the cost of constructing an ADU. 
ADUs are an important type of housing that adds gentle density to existing, established 
neighborhoods. ADUs can house a young professional, a retired grandparent, or many 
other members of the community. However, many homeowners lack the money to build an 
ADU, despite having the willingness and space. 
Amendments in the previous committees, resulting in the current SD1 version of the bill, 
has too greatly narrowed the scope and efficacy of this program. We hope that 
amendments to return the scope back to the original intended population would be made 
in this committee or in conference committee, and that restrictions that reduce the 
efficacy of this program are removed. 
We believe in fixing incentives, and this includes creating innovative and targeted 
incentives. Hawai‘i homebuyers continue to struggle to compete with non-Hawai‘i buyers 
both because of lack of funds and a non-dedicated housing stock. This innovative 
incentive will let counties purchase voluntary deed restrictions that require the

owner-occupant and/or renters be recently retired from or is a full time employee of a 
Hawai‘i business, with appropriate protections for those experiencing involuntary 
unemployment or disability. In the long-term, more homeowners would volunteer for the 
deed restriction and build ADUs. This will create a stock of homes dedicated to those who 
work and live in Hawai‘i. 
This alone will not solve the housing crisis, however, it will increase our overall supply of 
housing. Although small, building ADUs on plots of land that previously only had one unit, 
increasing the number of units on that same plot to two or three, is a much more efficient 
and affordable use of space. 
Hawai‘i YIMBY (Yes In My Backyard) is a volunteer-led grassroots advocacy organization 
dedicated to supporting bold and effective solutions for Hawai‘i’s devastating housing 
crisis. Our members are deeply concerned about Hawai‘i’s chronic and worsening housing 
shortage, which has caused home prices to rise much faster than incomes and pushes 
thousands of kamaʻāina out to the mainland or into homelessness every single year. 
We ask your support for this bill. Thank you for the opportunity to testify.

Testimony of the Hawai‘i Appleseed Center for Law and Economic Justice 
Support for HB 740 HD2 SD1 – Relating to Housing 
Senate Committee on Ways and Means 
Monday, March 31, 2025 at 10:02AM | Conf. Rm. 211  and via Videoconference 
 
Aloha Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki, and Members of the Committee: 
On behalf of Hawai‘i Appleseed, we support the intent of HB740 HD2 SD1 and encourage 
further collaboration on the bill in conference committee. 
We encourage the committee to revert HB740 HD2 SD1 back to the language in HB740 
HD2. Amendments in the previous committees, resulting in the current SD1 version of the bill, 
has too greatly narrowed the scope of this program. This would limit the impact that this 
program could make on our housing market in a meaningful way.  We hope that amendments to 
return the scope back to the original intended population would be made in this committee or in 
conference committee to maximize its impact.  
This bill would establish an Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) Financing and Deed Restriction 
Program which would address two critical challenges facing our communities: the severe 
shortage of affordable housing causing an increase in cost burdened households and the 
subsequent displacement of local families. Amid Hawai‘i’s housing crisis, approximately 56% of 
households across the state are rent-burdened, that is spending more than 30% of their income 
on rent, while only one in five households could afford purchasing the median single family 
home.1 
By providing grants for ADU construction while ensuring long-term affordability through deed 
restrictions, this bill offers a practical solution that could create immediate housing opportunities 
while preserving them exclusively for Hawaii's workforce. Additionally, this bill addresses 
concerns which were expressed by community members after the passing of Act 39 by 
providing financial means for our local homeowners to participate in and contribute to 
addressing our housing shortage as well as making Hawaii a place where residents can remain. 
We strongly support the intent of this measure for several key reasons: 
Addresses Financial Barriers: Estimates for ADU construction in Hawaii is about 
$250-$350 per square feet2. Many homeowners who wish to build ADUs to help address 
our housing crisis face significant financial barriers. The grant program will make it 
possible for more moderate-income homeowners to participate in creating housing 
solutions.

Support for HB 740 HD2 SD1 – Relating to Housing 
Senate Committee on Ways and Means 
Monday, March 31, 2025 at 10:02AM | Conf. Rm. 211  and via Videoconference 
 
Protects Local Workforce: The deed restriction requirements ensuring occupancy by 
local workers, maintaining employment within the county, demonstrate a thoughtful 
approach to preserving housing for Hawaii's working families. This helps prevent the 
conversion of these units to vacation rentals or investment properties and help establish 
a locals only market. 
Creates Sustainable Solutions: The perpetual deed restrictions ensure that these 
housing units will remain available for local workers and residents for generations to 
come, creating a lasting legacy of workforce housing that grows over time as more 
homeowners participate in the program. 
Empowers Residents to Actively Contribute: This program enables resident 
homeowners to play an active role in addressing Hawaii's housing challenges, 
empowering them to become part of the solution and directly contribute to building a 
stronger, more sustainable community. 
The bill also includes important accountability measures, such as annual reporting requirements 
and clear qualification criteria for both property owners and tenants. These provisions help 
ensure the program serves its intended purpose while remaining transparent and accountable to 
the public. 
Aligned with Hawaii Appleseed’s mission to promote social and economic justice, we view this 
program as an essential tool for tackling Hawaii's housing crisis while helping working 
families stay rooted in their communities. By pairing financial assistance with long-term 
affordability requirements, the program strikes a thoughtful balance that benefits both present 
and future generations. 
We respectfully urge your committee to pass this measure and either return it to its original 
intent in version HD2 or encourage further discussion in conference . This legislation represents 
an opportunity in creating sustainable, community-based solutions to our housing challenges 
while protecting opportunities for local working families and establishing a true “locals only” 
housing market.

RE: House Bill 740, HD2, SD1, Relating to Housing 
 
HEARING: Monday, March 31, 2025, at 10:02 a.m. 
 
 
Aloha Chair Dela Cruz, Vice Chair Moriwaki, and Members of the Committee: 
 
My name is Lyndsey Garcia, Director of Advocacy, testifying on behalf of the 
Hawai‘i Association of REALTORS® (“HAR”), the voice of real estate in Hawaii and its 
over 10,000 members. HAR provides comments on House Bill 740, HD2, SD1, which 
establishes the Accessory Dwelling Unit Financing and Deed Restriction Program to 
allocate funds to the counties for the purchase of equity in an accessory dwelling unit 
by the State. Specifies eligible homeowners or homebuyers for the Program to finance 
construction costs, development costs, and non-reoccurring closing costs associated 
with the construction of an accessory dwelling unit and purchase deed restrictions on 
the property. Sunsets 1/1/2031. Takes effect 7/1/2050. 
 
Hawai‘i REALTORS® supports the creation of accessory dwelling units to help 
increase the supply of housing and help address Hawaii’s housing challenges. We do 
however have concerns that the deed restrictions contained in this measure are in 
perpetuity. Having deed restrictions on a property in perpetuity can be problematic 
especially in land use planning, as communities can change and uses for a property 
may need to change as well over time. We respectfully suggest that the deed 
restrictions be amortized over 10 years but are open to other proposals for alternative 
timeframes. We look forward to further discussions on this matter. 
 
Mahalo for the opportunity to provide testimony on this measure.

My name is Anne Leake and I am writing in support of HB740 HD2 SD1 with amendments, 
which would establish the Accessory Dwelling Unit Deed Restriction Program to create a 
protected market of housing specifically for Hawaii workforce residents. 
I encourage the committee to revert HB740 HD2 SD1 back to the language in HB740 HD2. 
This bill provides grants for ADU construction while securing long-term affordability through 
deed restrictions, creating immediate housing opportunities and preserving them for Hawaii’s 
workforce. Many homeowners looking to build ADUs to ease our housing crisis struggle with 
financial barriers. This grant program will help more moderate-income homeowners contribute 
to housing solutions. 
This program addresses a core driver of Hawaii's housing crisis: the competition between local 
families and outside investors that has made home prices completely disconnected from local 
incomes. 
• 
Only 20% of Hawaii residents can afford a median-priced home 
• 
Outside buyers spend on average 46% more than local residents on home purchases 
• 
Median housing costs are 2.7 times the national level 
• 
Housing costs has been cited as the primary reason for locals leaving Hawaii, with a mass 
exodus of thousands of local families leaving 
By restricting occupancy and sale of housing to local workforce requirements, we create a 
dedicated housing stock that is tied to local wages and protected to housing price inflation caused 
by competition from non local investors. The deed restriction runs with the land forever. When 
selling, homeowners must sell to eligible buyers as defined by the deed restriction (local 
workforce). This restriction transfers to all future owners, so any new owner will need to follow 
the limitations set by the deed restriction.  
This means a dedicated stock of housing for our local workforce families remains stable 
and accessible for future generations. 
Many longtime local landowners want to preserve housing for locals, yet face increasing 
financial pressure to sell to outside investors. This program offers a practical solution while also 
helping to increase our housing stock. Offering financial incentives to increase ADU supply will 

provide local families with more versatile housing options; ones that offer smaller, more 
practical homes for local residents, as opposed to the luxury housing options currently available 
in our private housing market. Because of the smaller nature of ADUs, these units are typically 
more affordable and work for a variety of housing situations that fit local needs such as:  
• 
Starter homes for young adults and young families 
• 
Housing for Kupuna to live nearby family members and community networks 
• 
Independent spaces for individuals who can’t afford their place home yet but live in 
overcrowded housing situations 
I also strongly encourage the committee to amend the bill to include language from HB739 
HD2 which would have established the Kamaʻāina Homes Deed Restriction Program - offering 
similar incentives to deed restrict and preserve our existing housing stock for Hawai‘i’s 
workforce residents and families.  
This program would be especially helpful in areas with limited infrastructure capacity or 
restricted expansion. Without the ability to increase housing supply, preserving our current stock 
from entering the investment market becomes paramount.  
The contents of this program would appeal to homeowners who are willing to reduce future 
potential home sales to ensure homes are in local hands forever or don’t wish to sell their homes 
yet, but need access to funds. These funds could support households with expenses related to 
down payments, mortgages, education and business financing. 
By separating our local housing market from the global investment market, we can begin to 
address the massive gap between local incomes and housing costs that is forcing families to 
leave Hawaii. 
I strongly urge the committee to pass HB740 HD2 to create housing stability for Hawaii's 
families. 
Mahalo for the opportunity to testify.

I was blessed to have a good opportunity and financial support to be able to move out of a
