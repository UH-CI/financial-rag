Honorable Nadine K. Nakamura
Speaker, House of Representatives
Thirty-Third State Legislature
Regular Session of 2025
State of Hawaii
Madame:
Your Committee on Judiciary
& Hawaiian Affairs, to which was referred H.B. No. 740, H.D. 1, entitled:
"A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO HOUSING,"
begs leave to report as follows:
The
purpose of this measure is to establish the Accessory Dwelling Unit Financing
and Deed Restriction Program to allocate funds to the counties to provide
grants to eligible homeowners or homebuyers to finance construction costs,
development costs, and non-reoccurring closing costs associated with the
construction of an accessory dwelling unit and purchase deed restrictions on
such property.
Your Committee received testimony in support of this measure
from the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation; one member of the
Maui County Council; Office of Housing and Community Development of the County
of Hawai

individual.
Your Committee received
comments on this measure from the Department of the Attorney General;
Department of Taxation; Hawai
ʻ
i Association of
REALTORS; and Tax Foundation of Hawaii.
Your Committee
finds that this measure offers an effective solution to increase housing
supply, especially in residential areas with available space for additional
dwellings.
Your Committee further finds
that the Department of the Attorney General testified that the measure does not
appear to contain legally sufficient standards for the award of such grants
involving public money as required by the Hawaii State Constitution.
Accordingly,
your Committee has amended this measure by:
(1)
Inserting
appropriate standards for grant awards;
(2)
Clarifying
the exemption from conveyance taxes; and
(3)
Making
technical, nonsubstantive amendments for the purposes of clarity, consistency,
and style.
Your Committee
notes that the Department of Taxation is requesting that the conveyance tax
exemption take effect on January 1, 2026, to allow for form and instruction
changes necessary to implement the proposed exemption.
As affirmed by the
record of votes of the members of your Committee on Judiciary & Hawaiian
Affairs that is attached to this report, your Committee is in accord with the
intent and purpose of H.B. No. 740, H.D. 1, as amended herein, and recommends
that it be referred to your Committee on Finance in the form attached hereto as
H.B. No. 740, H.D. 2.
Respectfully
submitted on behalf of the members of the Committee on Judiciary & Hawaiian
Affairs,
