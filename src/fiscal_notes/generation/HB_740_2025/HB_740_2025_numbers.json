In addition, the deed restriction program will create an inventory of homes for local residents, stabilize home prices, and reduce speculation in our housing market. We do note that the ceiling of $2,000,000 per year will limit the reach of the program. Assuming that the average value of participating properties is $1,000,000, the cost of the deed restriction is $80,000, and $40,000 of equity is provided for each ADU, the program will be able to enroll about 17 properties per year.
