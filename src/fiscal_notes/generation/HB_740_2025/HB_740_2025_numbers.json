HHFDC supports the ADU Financing and Deed Restriction program as a way to increase the inventory of rental units in the State. In addition, the deed restriction program will create an inventory of homes for local residents, stabilize home prices, and reduce speculation in our housing market. We do note that the ceiling of $2,000,000 per year will limit the reach of the program. Assuming that the average value of participating properties is $1,000,000, the cost of the deed restriction is $80,000, and $40,000 of equity is provided for each ADU, the program will be able to enroll about 17 properties per year.

    "text": "property. Sunsets 1/01/2031. The upfront costs of designing and permitting an ADU are barriers for many homeowners. HHFDC supports the ADU Financing and Deed Restriction program as a way to increase the inventory of rental units in the State. In addition, the deed restriction program will create an inventory of homes for local residents, stabilize home prices, and reduce speculation in our housing market. We do note that the ceiling of $2,000,000 per year will limit the reach of the program. Assuming that the average value of participating properties is $1,000,000, the cost of the deed restriction is $80,000, and $40,000 of equity is provided for each ADU, the program will be able to enroll about 17 properties per year.
