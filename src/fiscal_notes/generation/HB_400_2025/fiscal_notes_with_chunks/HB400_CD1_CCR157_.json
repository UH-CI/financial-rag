These figures provide the agency with a concrete financial framework for operational planning. The agency will also move forward with managing the capital improvement projects funded by the $12,900,000 (HB400_CD1) appropriation.",

The bill reaffirms the policy of investing in court infrastructure by finalizing the capital improvement budget for the biennium.",
  "revenue_sources": "The Judiciary's operating budget is now set to be funded primarily by General Fund appropriations of $201,725,676 (HB400_CD1) for FY 2025-2026 and $199,579,345 (HB400_CD1) for FY 2026-2027.

The capital improvement appropriation of $12,900,000 (HB400_CD1) for FY 2025-2026 will create long-term fiscal obligations in the form of debt service payments.
