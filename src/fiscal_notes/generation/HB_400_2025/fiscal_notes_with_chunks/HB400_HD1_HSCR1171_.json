{
  "overview": "House Bill 400 appropriates funds for the Judiciary's operating and capital improvement costs for the 2025-2027 biennium. Key components include funding to make specialty courts permanent, staff the new Wahiawā District Court, add a judge in Kona, and enhance cybersecurity. The measure also includes capital funds for projects like the design of a new South Kohala District Courthouse and the relocation of the Children's Justice Center on O'ahu.",
  "appropriations": "The committee hearing determines a capital improvement appropriation of $11,900,000 (HB400_HD1_HSCR1171_) in general obligation bonds for fiscal year 2026. For operating costs, the committee hearing determines appropriations from general funds of $203,319,009 (HB400_HD1_HSCR1171_) for fiscal year 2026 and $203,391,600 (HB400_HD1_HSCR1171_) for fiscal year 2027. This finalizes the budget amounts, moving beyond the initial requests and recommendations outlined in the previous note.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "Fiscal projections are based on specific line-item requests from the Judiciary, detailing salary and expense calculations for new, temporary, and restored positions. Cost estimations for technology, such as the email security upgrade, are based on quotes for specific service levels. The capital project budget for the Children's Justice Center relocation was adjusted based on new cost information received by the Judiciary, which informed the increased lump sum request.",
  "agency_impact": "The measure provides resources to expand Judiciary services and address critical staffing shortages that have led to backlogs and operational strain. It enables the full staffing of the new Wahiawā District Court and adds a judgeship in Kona to manage a caseload of nearly 16,000 cases annually (HB400_TESTIMONY_FIN_03-05-25_). Funding also makes permanent several specialty court pilot programs, such as the Women's Court, ensuring their continuation.",
  "economic_impact": "Testimony from various legal aid organizations continues to pursue an additional $1,000,000 (HB400_HD1) for the civil legal services line item to support low-income residents. The Judiciary testimony indicates that making specialty courts like the Women's Court permanent provides an alternative to incarceration, potentially reducing long-term societal costs associated with recidivism. The expansion of the Truancy Court program represents an early intervention strategy to address attendance barriers and prevent students from entering the formal court process.",
  "policy_impact": "This measure transitions several pilot initiatives into permanent state functions, notably the Women's Court Pilot Project and the DWI Court Program, reflecting a policy focus on rehabilitative justice. It responds directly to demographic changes and increased caseloads by creating a new judgeship in Kona, thereby modifying the state's judicial resource allocation. The bill also addresses modern security threats by funding a dedicated cybersecurity staff and upgrading email security systems, aligning the Judiciary's technology posture with that of the Executive Branch.",
  "revenue_sources": "The primary revenue sources identified in the measure are general funds for operating expenses and general obligation bonds for capital improvement projects. The committee hearing determines the operating budget will be supported by $203,319,009 (HB400_HD1_HSCR1171_) in general funds for FY 2026 and $203,391,600 (HB400_HD1_HSCR1171_) for FY 2027. All capital projects are to be funded by $11,900,000 (HB400_HD1_HSCR1171_) in general obligation bonds.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The Judiciary testimony requests additional operating resources of $6.17M (HB400_TESTIMONY_FIN_03-05-25_) in FY 2026 and $6.25M (HB400_TESTIMONY_FIN_03-05-25_) in FY 2027 for 17.0 permanent and 1.0 temporary FTE. Key recurring annual costs that will extend beyond the biennium include establishing the permanent Women’s Court at $705,416 (HB400_TESTIMONY_FIN_03-05-25_) per year and funding a new Kona District Court Judge and staff for approximately $368,943 (HB400_TESTIMONY_FIN_03-05-25_) in FY 2026 and $360,048 (HB400_TESTIMONY_FIN_03-05-25_) in FY 2027. The new Wahiawā District Court will require ongoing funding for staffing and contracted security, estimated at $486,967 (HB400_TESTIMONY_FIN_03-05-25_) in FY 2027. A major ongoing technology cost is the cybersecurity email subscription upgrade, for which testimony requests $1,175,300 (HB400_TESTIMONY_FIN_03-05-25_) annually. The continued funding for the Criminal Justice Research Institute is requested at $512,624 (HB400_TESTIMONY_FIN_03-05-25_) in FY 2026 and $577,058 (HB400_TESTIMONY_FIN_03-05-25_) in FY 2027. Restoration of numerous defunded positions across all circuits also adds recurring salary costs to the Judiciary's base budget. Many of these funded items are for permanent positions and programs, indicating these costs will continue indefinitely. These figures will establish a new, higher baseline for the Judiciary's operating budget in subsequent fiscal planning periods.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The provided legislative documents and testimony do not indicate any anticipated changes to the Judiciary's operating revenues as a result of this measure. The bill is focused on appropriations for expenditures rather than the generation of new revenue streams through fees or other sources. Therefore, no significant impact on operating revenue is expected.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The committee hearing determines a total capital expenditure appropriation of $11,900,000 (HB400_HD1_HSCR1171_) in bond funds for FY 2026. Judiciary testimony specifies this amount is requested for several projects, including $4.0 million (HB400_TESTIMONY_FIN_03-05-25_) for the design of a new South Kohala District Courthouse and $900,000 (HB400_TESTIMONY_FIN_03-05-25_) to replace an A/C chiller in Kaua'i. The total also includes $7.0 million (HB400_TESTIMONY_FIN_03-05-25_) in lump sum bond funds, which incorporates an additional $2.0 million (HB400_TESTIMONY_FIN_03-05-25_) required for the relocation of the Children’s Justice Center on Oʻahu.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "Many programs funded by this measure, such as the now-permanent Women's Court and DWI Court, will have ongoing fiscal obligations that extend beyond the initial six-year planning window. The creation of a new permanent judgeship in Kona, along with its support staff, represents a permanent increase in the Judiciary's annual operating costs. These positions and programs will be integrated into the Judiciary's base budget, requiring sustained general fund appropriations in all future fiscal years.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The previous fiscal note detailed an initial capital improvement request for $9.9M (HB400_TESTIMONY_JHA_01-30-25_) with a committee recommendation to add $2,000,000 (HB400_HSCR286_). This updated note confirms the capital appropriation has been finalized at $11,900,000 (HB400_HD1_HSCR1171_) and provides a more detailed project breakdown. Most significantly, this new note introduces comprehensive details on the Judiciary's operating budget requests, which total $6.17M (HB400_TESTIMONY_FIN_03-05-25_) for FY 2026 and $6.25M (HB400_TESTIMONY_FIN_03-05-25_) for FY 2027, and includes the final appropriated operating budget figures, information absent from the prior note.",
