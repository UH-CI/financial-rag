  "overview": "This measure still appropriates funds for the Judiciary's biennium budget, but it has been amended to address federal actions impacting immigration. In addition to funding Judiciary operations and capital projects, the bill now also includes appropriations for civil and immigration-related legal services. This addition reflects testimony concerning the increased need for legal support for low-income and immigrant communities.",
  "appropriations": "The Senate Committee on Judiciary has increased the appropriation for the Administration (JUD601) program. The committee report increases the appropriation by $1,750,000 (HB400_SD1_SSCR1253_) to fund civil legal services and legal representation in immigration-related proceedings. This is in addition to the operating and capital funds detailed previously.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "",
  "agency_impact": "While the impact on core Judiciary operations remains as previously described, the department will now have an expanded administrative role. The Judiciary will be responsible for administering and disbursing the newly appropriated funds for civil and immigration legal services to external non-profit organizations. This adds a new layer of fiscal and programmatic oversight to the Administration (JUD601) program.",
  "economic_impact": "The measure now directly addresses requests from legal aid organizations by providing new funding for their services. Testimony from The Legal Clinic requested $750,000 (HB400_HD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-19-25_) for immigration-related proceedings, and multiple organizations pursued an additional $1,000,000 (HB400_HD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-19-25_) for civil legal services. The committee report recommends funding these requests, which will expand the capacity of providers to assist low-income residents facing eviction, deportation, and family separation.",
  "policy_impact": "This measure now establishes a new state policy of providing dedicated funding for legal services related to immigration court proceedings. This change, reflected in the committee report's specific allocation of $750,000 (HB400_SD1_SSCR1253_) for this purpose, is a direct response to concerns over federal immigration enforcement. It represents a significant expansion of the state's role in ensuring access to justice for non-citizen residents.",
  "revenue_sources": "",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "In addition to the Judiciary's internal operating requests, the six-year outlook now includes a significant new recurring expenditure for legal services. The committee report's addition of $1,750,000 (HB400_SD1_SSCR1253_) for civil and immigration legal services in FY 2026 establishes a new baseline for the JUD601 program budget. Testimony from multiple legal aid societies suggests this need is ongoing, indicating that these funds will likely be requested in subsequent biennia. This creates a new, sustained general fund obligation administered through the Judiciary.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The newly established funding streams for civil and immigration-related legal services are likely to become an ongoing fiscal obligation. As these funds are intended to address systemic needs highlighted in testimony, there will be an expectation for their continuation beyond the initial six-year period. This institutionalizes a new category of state expenditure administered by the Judiciary.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The primary update from the previous fiscal note is the amendment to the Judiciary's budget to include substantial new funding for external legal services providers. While the prior note finalized the HD1 budget, this note reflects the changes in SD1, which adds $1,750,000 (HB400_SD1_SSCR1253_) to the Administration (JUD601) budget. This new appropriation is specifically designated for civil legal services and, for the first time, for legal services for individuals in immigration-related court proceedings, based on testimony from several legal aid organizations.",
