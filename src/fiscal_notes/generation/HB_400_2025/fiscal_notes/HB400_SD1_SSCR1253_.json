  "overview": "This measure appropriates funds for the Judiciary for the 2025–2027 biennium. [7] The purpose and intent of this measure is to provide for the expenses of the judicial branch of the State of Hawaii. [9] Operating resource requests center around funding to make permanent or expand three Specialty Courts on O‘ahu, to fully staff the new Wahiawā District Court that will open during this biennium, an additional District Court Judge and support staff in Kona, cybersecurity and critical technology costs, funding for the Criminal Justice Research Institute (CJRI), and restoration of funding for essential staffing that was defunded during the early part of the COVID-19 pandemic. [7] [7] [7]",
  "appropriations": "This measure appropriates moneys for the Judiciary for the fiscal biennium that begins on July 1, 2025, and ends on June 30, 2027. [9] The Judiciary requests additional operating resources in the amount of $6.17M in FY 2026, and $6.25M in FY 2027. [7] [7] The Committee recommends that the Judiciary budget be amended by providing an additional $1,000,000 (HB400_SD1_SSCR1253_.htm.txt) for civil legal services and $750,000 (HB400_SD1_SSCR1253_.htm.txt) for legal services to individuals in immigration-related court proceedings, increasing the appropriation for Administration (JUD601) by $1,750,000 (HB400_SD1_SSCR1253_.htm.txt). [9] [9]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The Judiciary’s resource requirements for Fiscal Biennium 2025–2027 are based on current circumstances and projected resource needs for the future. [7] The request for additional operating resources is an addition of approximately 3% to the Judiciary’s operating budget. [7] The request for a total of $11.9M (from testimony) in bond funds for capital improvement projects in FY 2026 includes a request for $2M (from testimony) more in lump sum than the measure as introduced because the Judiciary received new information that the relocation of the Children’s Justice Center on O‘ahu will require at least $2M (from testimony) more than previously appropriated. [7] [7]",
  "agency_impact": "The Judiciary requests additional operating resources in the amount of 17.0 permanent FTE and 1.0 temporary FTE. [7] [7] Nine of the 18 requested positions are to continue current staffing, as seven temporary positions for the Women’s Court Pilot Project and positions for the CJRI will expire. [7] [7] The remaining requested positions will significantly expand capacity to certain operations, including adding a second district court judge in Kona and staffing the new Wahiawā District Court. [7] [7] [7]",
  "economic_impact": "The Women's Court program aims to aid participants in bettering their economic conditions and life circumstances and to prevent re-entry into criminality. [7] Funding for civil legal services would support the delivery of services to low- and moderate-income individuals in Hawai‘i. [7] The committee recognizes potential impacts on people in Hawaii from federal actions, including increased costs and adverse consequences for families and businesses, prompting additional funding recommendations for legal services. [9]",
  "policy_impact": "This measure proposes to establish a permanent Women’s Court, as the three-year pilot project is set to expire at the end of FY 2025. [7] [7] It would make the Driving While Impaired (DWI) Court Program permanent, which was initially supported by federal funding. [7] [7] The measure also restores funding for selected defunded positions that were removed from the Judiciary’s budget during the early part of the pandemic to help the State’s economic crisis at that time. [7]",
  "revenue_sources": "The appropriations in this measure are primarily from general funds and general obligation bond funds.

[8] Testimony supports increasing the civil legal services fund by an additional $1 million (from testimony) and requests funding of $750,000 (HB400_HD1_TESTIMONY_JDC_03-19-25_.PDF.txt) for immigration-related legal representation.

[7] [7] Five requests to staff the Wahiawā District Court, which opens in Spring 2026, include restoring funding for adult client services, a janitor, an IT technician, court clerks, bailiffs, and funding for contracted security. [7]",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The Judiciary remains vigilant during this period of uncertainty over federal funding and the possible impact on the State and Judiciary budgets and operations. [7] [7] The drastic cuts in federal funding make it all the more critical that funds be appropriated to provide essential civil legal services to those of low- and moderate-income. [7] The documents do not identify any new sources of operating revenue resulting from this measure. [8] [8]",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The Judiciary requests a total of $11.9M (from testimony) in bond funds for capital improvement projects in FY 2026. [7] This measure states that general obligation bonds issued shall not exceed $11,900,000 (HB400_SD1_.HTM.txt).

[7] [7] [7]",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "Securing permanent funding would allow the DWI Court Program to continue and grow beyond the biennium. [7] The requests to establish a permanent Women’s Court and restore funding for numerous permanent positions imply ongoing operational costs after FY 2027. [7] [7] The new Wahiawā District Court, scheduled to open in Spring 2026, will require sustained funding for staffing and operations in subsequent years. [7]",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "This fiscal note incorporates new recommendations from the Senate Committee on Judiciary. [9] The committee recommends amending the Judiciary budget to provide an additional $1,000,000 (HB400_SD1_SSCR1253_.htm.txt) for civil legal services and $750,000 (HB400_SD1_SSCR1253_.htm.txt) for legal services to individuals in immigration-related court proceedings, which was not specified in the previous fiscal note's sources. [9] [9] This is a response to the current efforts of the federal government to downsize or eliminate certain federal programs and to increase the number and rate of deportations. [9] Consequently, the committee amended the measure by increasing the appropriation for Administration (JUD601) by $1,750,000 (HB400_SD1_SSCR1253_.htm.txt). [9]"
