  "overview": "The Senate Judiciary Committee amended the measure to expand its scope, incorporating significant new appropriations for legal services. These additions are intended to support civil legal aid and provide legal assistance for individuals in immigration-related proceedings. This change reflects the committee's response to testimony regarding the potential impacts of changing federal policies on Hawai'i residents.",
  "appropriations": "The Senate Committee on Judiciary increased the total appropriation for the Administration program (JUD601) by $1,750,000. This new funding is specifically allocated for two purposes: $1,000,000 for civil legal services and $750,000 for legal services for individuals involved in immigration-related court proceedings. These amounts are expected to be recurring annual appropriations.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "",
  "agency_impact": "The Judiciary will be responsible for administering the additional $1,750,000 in annual appropriations for civil and immigration legal services. The Judiciary provided testimony supporting this role and the additional funding, on the condition that it does not supplant the agency's own operational and programmatic budget requests. This amendment expands the Judiciary's administrative function as a conduit for funding community legal service providers.",
  "economic_impact": "Acting on testimony from legal aid organizations, the Senate Judiciary Committee has formally allocated $1,750,000 in additional funding to support legal safety net providers. This includes $1,000,000 for general civil legal services and a new allocation of $750,000 for immigration-related proceedings, aimed at mitigating adverse consequences for families and businesses due to federal policy shifts. This action moves beyond the initial request noted in the previous version of the bill to a formal appropriation.",
  "policy_impact": "The Senate Committee on Judiciary further amended the billâ€™s effective date, changing it to April 23, 2057. This procedural change continues the legislative strategy of using a defective effective date to ensure the measure receives further consideration and discussion. This follows a similar amendment made previously by the House.",
  "revenue_sources": "While the fundamental revenue sources remain unchanged, the allocation from the general fund is set to increase by $1,750,000 annually. This increase will cover the new appropriations for civil and immigration legal services administered by the Judiciary. Capital improvement projects continue to be funded through the issuance of general obligation bonds.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The amendments introduced by the Senate Judiciary Committee add a new recurring annual cost of $1,750,000 for civil and immigration legal services, increasing the state's long-term operating budget commitments beyond the initial biennium. This formalizes and expands upon the funding requests from legal aid organizations noted in testimony on the previous draft, establishing an ongoing appropriation to address sustained community needs. The Judiciary's core budget requests for programs and staffing remain, solidifying other recurring costs in the six-year outlook.",

  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The ongoing fiscal obligations after the initial six-year period will now include an additional $1,750,000 per year for civil and immigration legal services. This funding is expected to become a recurring part of the Judiciary's budget, which is passed through to community legal service providers. The long-term sustainability of this funding will depend on future legislative appropriations.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The primary update is the amendment by the Senate Committee on Judiciary (HB400 SD1), detailed in report SSCR1253. Key changes include adding $1,750,000 in recurring annual appropriations, comprising $1,000,000 for civil legal services and $750,000 for immigration-related legal services, in response to testimony on federal policy shifts. Consequently, the bill's effective date was changed to April 23, 2057, to facilitate further discussion, and the Judiciary provided testimony supporting the new funding on the condition it does not affect its core budget."
