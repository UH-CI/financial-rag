  "overview": "This measure has been amended to appropriate an additional $1,750,000 to the Judiciary's budget for the 2025-2027 fiscal biennium. The new funds are specifically designated for grants to nonprofit organizations providing civil legal services and legal assistance to individuals in immigration-related court proceedings. This change reflects the legislature's intent to mitigate the potential impacts of federal policy shifts on Hawai'i residents.",
  "appropriations": "As amended by the Senate Committee on Judiciary (S.D. 1), the appropriation for Administration (JUD601) is increased by $1,750,000 for the biennium. This amount is designated to be expended for civil legal services ($1,000,000) and for legal services for individuals in immigration-related proceedings ($750,000). This increases the total general fund appropriation for operating costs.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The additional appropriations for legal services are based on testimony from legal aid organizations highlighting significant unmet needs and concerns over federal actions. The committee report (SSCR1253) cites the potential for increased deportations and the downsizing of federal programs as the primary justification. The funding amounts of $1,000,000 and $750,000 reflect specific requests made in testimony to address these anticipated impacts on families and businesses.",
  "agency_impact": "The Judiciary's Administration (JUD601) will be tasked with administering an additional $1,750,000 in grant funds for external legal service providers. This adds a new administrative responsibility to manage the procurement and distribution of funds for civil and immigration-related legal aid. This is in addition to the previously identified impacts from internal program expansions.",
  "economic_impact": "The added funding is intended to mitigate the adverse economic consequences for families and businesses that could result from increased federal deportation actions and cuts to federal programs. By providing legal representation, the measure aims to promote family unity, community stability, and economic security for vulnerable residents. This is a shift from focusing solely on savings from specialty courts to also addressing external economic threats.",
  "policy_impact": "The measure now incorporates a significant new policy to use state funds to counteract the local impacts of federal immigration and social program policies. By funding legal services for civil and immigration-related proceedings, the legislature is establishing a state-level safety net for residents who may be affected by changes at the federal level. This expands the bill's policy scope beyond internal judicial administration and reform.",
  "revenue_sources": "The new funding of $1,750,000 for legal services is appropriated from the State's General Fund. This is in addition to the general funds previously identified for the Judiciary's operating budget increases. No new types of revenue sources are introduced.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The amendment adds a new, recurring annual cost of $1,750,000 to the Judiciary's base budget for grants to legal service providers. This raises the total new recurring operating costs from approximately $6.2 million to nearly $8 million annually. These funds for civil and immigration legal services are intended to be ongoing, establishing a significant long-term commitment beyond the initial biennium.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The additional $1,750,000 annually for civil and immigration legal services will become a permanent part of the Judiciary's base budget, increasing its ongoing fiscal obligations. This raises the total ongoing commitment for new programs and services to nearly $8 million per year. The sustainability of this funding will be an ongoing consideration in future state budgets.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The primary update is the amendment made in H.B. 400, S.D. 1, which increases the Judiciary's operating budget by $1,750,000 for the biennium. This new appropriation allocates $1,000,000 for civil legal services and $750,000 for legal services in immigration-related proceedings, to be administered by the Judiciary (JUD601). This change was made by the Senate Committee on Judiciary in response to testimony regarding federal policy shifts and is a recurring general fund expenditure, unlike the one-time capital improvement funding previously detailed."
