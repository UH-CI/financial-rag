  "overview": "House Bill 400, HD1, SD1 was amended to appropriate an additional $1,750,000 for the 2025-2027 fiscal biennium. This new funding is designated for civil legal services and for legal assistance to individuals in immigration-related court proceedings. The amendment is a response to testimony regarding increased community needs and anticipated changes in federal policy and funding.",
  "appropriations": "The Senate Committee on Judiciary amended the measure to increase the appropriation for the Administration program (JUD601) by $1,750,000 in general funds for the biennium. This increase provides an additional $1,000,000 for civil legal services and a new allocation of $750,000 for legal services related to immigration proceedings. This brings the total additional operating resources requested to approximately $7.92 million in FY 2026 and $8.0 million in FY 2027.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The additional funding amounts are based on specific requests from testimony provided by non-profit legal aid organizations. The committee's amendment assumes that state funding is necessary to offset the potential downsizing of federal programs and increased immigration enforcement actions. The funding level reflects the direct requests of $1,000,000 from civil legal service providers and $750,000 from an immigration legal services provider.",
  "agency_impact": "The Judiciary's administrative responsibilities will expand, as it will manage and disburse an additional $1,750,000 in grant funds to external non-profit legal service providers. This increases its role as a fiscal conduit for access to justice initiatives. The Judiciary may require additional administrative resources for the oversight of these new and expanded grant programs.",
  "economic_impact": "The supplemental funding for legal services is intended to mitigate potential adverse economic impacts on families and businesses resulting from federal immigration actions. By providing legal representation, the measure aims to prevent outcomes like deportation, family separation, and eviction, which can disrupt the workforce and increase demand for other state-funded social services. This promotes family stability and supports community economic security.",
  "policy_impact": "The measure was amended to establish a new state policy of providing dedicated funding for legal representation in immigration proceedings, creating a state-level response to shifts in federal policy. This action significantly expands the state's social safety net for vulnerable populations. It also broadens the scope of the state's commitment to funding civil legal services.",
  "revenue_sources": "",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The addition of $1,750,000 annually for legal services grants establishes a new, higher baseline for the Judiciary's budget that will likely continue into future fiscal years. This funding addresses ongoing societal needs, which will likely result in recurring requests in subsequent budgets to sustain the operations of non-profit legal aid providers. The long-term fiscal impact depends on the continuation of this funding as a state priority, particularly in light of uncertain federal policies.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The new appropriations for civil and immigration legal services create a precedent for continued state support beyond the initial biennium. These funds address fundamental needs within the community, suggesting that they will become an ongoing fiscal obligation for the state. Sustaining this level of funding will depend on future state revenue and policy priorities.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The primary change from the previous fiscal note is the amendment made by the Senate Committee on Judiciary, which adds $1,750,000 in general funds for legal services in response to testimony from legal aid organizations. This new appropriation is allocated as a $1,000,000 increase for general civil legal services and a new $750,000 provision for legal services in immigration-related proceedings. This change reflects a policy decision to use state funds to mitigate the potential impacts of changing federal policies and funding."
