  "overview": "This measure appropriates funds for the Judiciary for the fiscal biennium beginning 7/1/2025, and ending 6/30/2027. [10] The purpose and intent of this measure is to appropriate moneys for the Judiciary for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027. [12] Key operating resource requests are for making permanent or expanding three Specialty Courts on O‘ahu, staffing the new Wahiawā District Court, adding a District Court Judge in Kona, funding cybersecurity, and restoring essential staffing. [10]",
  "appropriations": "As amended, this measure appropriates general funds of $198,782,736 (HB400_SD2_SSCR1841_.htm.txt) for Fiscal Year 2025-2026 and $198,855,327 (HB400_SD2_SSCR1841_.htm.txt) for Fiscal Year 2026-2027. [12] It appropriates capital improvement project funds from general obligation bonds of $12,900,000 (HB400_SD2_SSCR1841_.htm.txt) for Fiscal Year 2025-2026. [12] The bill specifies that of the general fund appropriation for administration, $1,000,000 (HB400_SD2_.HTM.txt) shall be expended for civil legal services and $750,000 (HB400_SD2_.HTM.txt) shall be expended on legal services for individuals in immigration-related proceedings for each fiscal year. [11] [11]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The Judiciary's budget reflects its resource requirements for Fiscal Biennium 2025–2027 based on current circumstances and projected resource needs for the future. [10] The requested increase in operating resources is an addition of approximately 3% to the Judiciary’s operating budget. [10] The capital improvement request was increased to address a shortfall in funding for the relocation of the Children’s Justice Center on Oʻahu, with the latest estimate showing the project cost will exceed $8.0 million (from Public testimony). [10] [10]",
  "agency_impact": "The Judiciary requests additional operating resources in the amount of 17.0 permanent FTE and 1.0 temporary FTE. [10] Nine of the 18 requested positions are to continue current staffing for programs like the Women’s Court Pilot Project and the Criminal Justice Research Institute (CJRI) where positions or funding will expire. [10] The remaining requested positions are intended to significantly expand capacity to certain operations, such as adding an additional District Court Judge in Kona and staffing for the new Wahiawā District Court. [10] [10]",
  "economic_impact": "The Women’s Court program aims to aid participants in bettering their economic conditions and life circumstances and prevent re-entry into criminality. [10] Funding for civil legal services supports safety net providers who deliver legal services to low- and moderate- income individuals in Hawai‘i. [10] [10] In Hawaiʻi, at least 72% of households had one or more civil legal problems in the past year, and current resources are not meeting the community's needs. [10] [10]",
  "policy_impact": "This measure supports making the Women’s Court Pilot Project permanent, as the initial three-year pilot is set to expire at the end of FY 2025. [10] [10] The bill would also make the Driving While Impaired (DWI) Court Program permanent, which has been operational since 2013 with initial federal funding. [10] [10] A group of requests is to restore funding for selected positions that were defunded during the early part of the pandemic to help the State’s economic crisis at that time. [10]",
  "revenue_sources": "The appropriations are from general funds (A), special funds (B), general obligation bond funds (C), and revolving funds (W). [11] [11] General obligation bonds may be issued to yield the amount necessary to finance projects, provided the sum total does not exceed $12,900,000 (HB400_SD2_.HTM.txt). [11] Testimonies support supplementing the civil legal services line-item with an additional $1,000,000 (from Public testimony) to meet the needs of the community. [10]",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The Judiciary requests additional operating resources of $6.17M in FY 2026 and $6.25M in FY 2027. [10] The request for the permanent Women’s Court is $705,416 (from Public testimony) in FY 2026 and $705,416 (from Public testimony) in FY 2027. [10] [10] Funding requested for the Truancy Court and EEIP is $188,388 (from Public testimony) in FY 2026 and $183,288 (from Public testimony) in FY 2027. [10] [10] The DWI Court Program requests $232,412 (from Public testimony) in FY 2026 and $237,612 (from Public testimony) in FY 2027. [10] [10] For the additional Kona District Court Judge and staff, the request is for $368,943 (from Public testimony) in FY 2026 and $360,048 (from Public testimony) in FY 2027. [10] Cybersecurity and technology requests total $1,175,300 (from Public testimony) in each year of the biennium for email upgrades, $458,224 (from Public testimony) in each year for cybersecurity staff, and $560,000 (from Public testimony) in FY 2026 and $420,000 (from Public testimony) in FY 2027 for network switches. [10] [10] [10] The Criminal Justice Research Institute requests total $512,624 (from Public testimony) in FY 2026 and $577,058 (from Public testimony) in FY 2027 for a permanent position and software, plus $71,016 (from Public testimony) in both years for a temporary position. [10] [10] The Office of the Public Guardian requests $136,314 (from Public testimony) in FY 2026 and $125,424 (from Public testimony) in FY 2027. [10] [10] An increase of $151,000 (from Public testimony) is requested in both FY 2026 and FY 2027 to cover risk management costs. [10] Multiple requests relate to staffing the new Wahiawā District Court, which will open in Spring 2026, including funds for adult client services, a janitor, IT support, security, clerks, and bailiffs. [10]",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The Judiciary remains vigilant during this period of uncertainty over federal funding and the possible impact on the State and Judiciary budgets and operations. [10] Legal aid providers note that there have been dramatic reductions in available federal funds for victims of crime and domestic-violence survivors. [10] The provided documents do not identify any new sources of operating revenue resulting from this measure. [11] [11] [11] [11] [11]",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The measure appropriates $12,900,000 (HB400_SD2_.HTM.txt) in general obligation bond funds for capital improvement projects in FY 2025-2026. [11] [12] Projects listed include $4,000,000 (HB400_SD2_.HTM.txt) for plans and design for a new South Kohala District Courthouse. [11] The bill also includes $900,000 (HB400_SD2_.HTM.txt) for a chiller replacement at the Kauai Judiciary Complex and $8,000,000 (HB400_SD2_.HTM.txt) for lump sum CIP for judiciary facilities statewide. [11]",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "Making the DWI Court Program permanent would allow the program to continue and grow beyond the biennium. [10] Establishing a permanent Women’s Court and restoring funding for other permanent positions imply ongoing operational costs after the 2025-2027 biennium. [10] [10] The new Wahiawā District Court, which opens in Spring 2026, will require sustained funding for staffing, operations, and maintenance in subsequent years. [10]",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "This fiscal note reflects amendments made by the Committee on Ways and Means. [12] The amended measure makes the following appropriations for operating costs from general funds: $198,782,736 (HB400_SD2_SSCR1841_.htm.txt) for Fiscal Year 2025-2026 and $198,855,327 (HB400_SD2_SSCR1841_.htm.txt) for Fiscal Year 2026-2027, which are different from the amounts in the introduced version. [12] The capital improvement appropriation from general obligation bond funds was increased to $12,900,000 (HB400_SD2_SSCR1841_.htm.txt). [12] The bill now explicitly appropriates $1,000,000 (HB400_SD2_.HTM.txt) for civil legal services and $750,000 (HB400_SD2_.HTM.txt) for immigration-related legal services for each fiscal year, whereas previously this was a committee recommendation. [11] [11] The effective date of the measure was changed to July 1, 2050, to facilitate further discussion. [12] [11]"
