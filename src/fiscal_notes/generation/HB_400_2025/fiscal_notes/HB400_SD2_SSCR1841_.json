  "overview": "This measure has been amended to increase funding for the Judiciary's capital improvement projects for fiscal year 2026. The primary changes involve appropriating funds for the design of a new courthouse in South Kohala to address safety and capacity issues. Additionally, the lump sum for statewide facility improvements has been increased to cover a projected shortfall for the relocation of the O'ahu Children's Justice Center.",
  "appropriations": "The appropriation for capital improvement projects has been increased, with the total authorized general obligation bond funds for fiscal year 2026 now at $12,900,000 (HB400_SD2_SSCR1841_). This funding is designated for three projects: $4,000,000 (HB400_SD2) for the plans and design of a new South Kohala District Courthouse, $900,000 (HB400_SD2) to replace a chiller at the Kauai Judiciary Complex, and $8,000,000 (HB400_SD2) for lump sum improvements to Judiciary facilities statewide.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The funding for the South Kohala Courthouse design is based on the need to replace the current facility, built in 1982, which is now inadequate for a local population that has grown by 230% (HB400_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_). The increase in the lump sum CIP appropriation is based on updated cost estimates for the relocation of the Children's Justice Center on O'ahu. Testimony indicates the project cost is now expected to exceed $8,000,000 (HB400_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_), creating a shortfall that this funding addresses.",
  "agency_impact": "The increased capital improvement funding will require the Judiciary to manage significant new infrastructure projects, adding to its administrative workload. This includes overseeing the design process for the new South Kohala courthouse and managing the funds for the Children's Justice Center relocation. These projects will necessitate close coordination with other state agencies, such as the Department of Accounting and General Services, on planning and execution.",
  "economic_impact": "The newly appropriated capital improvement funds are expected to stimulate local economies through contracts for design and construction-related services. The plan to build the new South Kohala District Court on an existing state-owned parcel is projected to avoid additional land acquisition costs (HB400_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_). In the long term, modernizing court facilities will improve public access to justice and safety for court users and staff in communities with growing populations.",
  "policy_impact": "This measure now reflects a heightened legislative focus on addressing the Judiciary's aging infrastructure and capacity constraints, particularly in underserved communities. Appropriating funds for the design of a new South Kohala courthouse reinforces a policy of modernizing facilities to meet current ADA, safety, and operational standards. This action directly responds to testimony detailing the severe inadequacy of the current courthouse (HB400_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_).",
  "revenue_sources": "The new capital improvement projects will be funded through the issuance of general obligation bonds. The bill authorizes the issuance of up to $12,900,000 (HB400_SD2) in bonds for the specified projects. This represents an increase from the $9,900,000 (HB400_SD2_SSCR1841_) proposed in the bill as introduced.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The appropriation of $12,900,000 (HB400_SD2) in general obligation bond funds for FY 2026 will create a long-term fiscal impact in the form of debt service payments over the life of the bonds. While the $4,000,000 (HB400_SD2) for the South Kohala courthouse is for design, it signals a commitment to a future construction project that will require a much larger capital appropriation in a subsequent biennium. The $8,000,000 (HB400_SD2) for lump sum CIP covers immediate needs, including a funding shortfall for the Children's Justice Center relocation, but ongoing maintenance for aging facilities will require continued investment. The $900,000 (HB400_SD2) for the Kauai chiller replacement addresses an immediate end-of-lifecycle need for a critical component of the facility's infrastructure (HB400_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_).",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The bill now includes a total of $12,900,000 (HB400_SD2) in capital expenditures from general obligation bond funds for FY 2026. This funding is allocated for three specific projects: $4,000,000 (HB400_SD2) for plans and design of a new South Kohala District Courthouse, $900,000 (HB400_SD2) for a chiller replacement in Kauai, and $8,000,000 (HB400_SD2) for lump sum facility improvements statewide. Testimony from the Judiciary confirms a portion of the lump sum funds will address a funding shortfall of at least $2,000,000 (HB400_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_) for the relocation of the O'ahu Children's Justice Center.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The design funding for the new South Kohala District Courthouse creates a significant future fiscal obligation for the state. Once the design is complete, a much larger appropriation for construction will be required, followed by recurring annual operating and maintenance costs for a larger, modern facility. This represents a long-term financial commitment that will extend well beyond the initial six-year fiscal period.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The primary update from the previous fiscal note is the substantial increase in capital improvement project (CIP) funding for the Judiciary. The general obligation bond fund appropriation was increased to $12,900,000 (HB400_SD2_SSCR1841_) in this version of the bill. This new funding specifically allocates $4,000,000 (HB400_SD2) for the design of a new courthouse in South Kohala and increases the lump sum CIP to $8,000,000 (HB400_SD2), partly to address a funding shortfall for the O'ahu Childrenâ€™s Justice Center relocation, as detailed in testimony (HB400_SD1_TESTIMONY_WAM_03-31-25_)."
