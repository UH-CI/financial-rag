  "overview": "This measure has been amended to reflect significant adjustments by the Senate Committee on Ways and Means. The general fund operating budget for the Judiciary has been reduced by approximately $4.5 million annually compared to the previous version, indicating a rejection of some requested program expansions. Concurrently, the capital improvement project (CIP) budget has been increased by $3 million to address critical infrastructure needs, including the design of a new South Kohala Courthouse and other statewide facility upgrades.",
  "appropriations": "As amended in S.D. 2, the total general fund operating appropriation is now $198,782,736 for FY 2026 and $198,855,327 for FY 2027, a decrease of roughly $4.5 million per year. The Capital Improvement Project appropriation for FY 2026 has been increased by $3,000,000, from $9,900,000 to $12,900,000, to be funded by general obligation bonds. The specific line items for civil ($1,000,000) and immigration ($750,000) legal services within the Administration (JUD601) budget remain.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The revised appropriations are based on the Ways and Means Committee's determination of sufficient funding levels, which involved not funding all of the Judiciary's operating budget expansion requests. The increase in the CIP budget is based on testimony highlighting urgent needs for facility upgrades, such as the dilapidated South Kohala courthouse and the relocation of the O'ahu Children's Justice Center. The final lump sum CIP amount of $8,000,000 exceeds the Judiciary's updated request, indicating a strong legislative priority for addressing deferred maintenance and infrastructure.",
  "agency_impact": "The reduction in the operating budget will require the Judiciary to prioritize its planned expansions and may delay the restoration of certain defunded positions. Conversely, the increased capital budget will allow the Judiciary to proceed with the design phase for a new South Kohala courthouse and address a larger scope of statewide facility improvements. The administrative responsibility for managing the $1,750,000 in legal services grants is unchanged.",
  "economic_impact": "The increased capital improvement funding of $12,900,000 is expected to generate economic activity in the state through spending on design and construction services. The investment in a new courthouse in South Kohala aims to improve long-term access to justice for the community. The intended economic benefits of providing legal services to vulnerable populations remain as previously noted.",
  "policy_impact": "This version of the bill reflects a legislative policy that prioritizes investment in physical judicial infrastructure over a full expansion of the Judiciary's operating programs and staffing. While the commitment to funding legal aid to counter federal policy impacts is maintained, the overall fiscal approach demonstrates greater restraint on recurring costs in favor of one-time capital investments. This indicates a strategic choice to address long-standing facility deficits.",
  "revenue_sources": "While the General Fund is the source for the operating budget, the total appropriation from this source has been reduced. The additional $3,000,000 for the capital improvement budget will be funded through the issuance of General Obligation Bonds. The revenue sources for the legal services grants remain the General Fund.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The projected increase to the Judiciary's recurring base budget is now approximately $4.5 million less per year than under the previous draft, moderating the long-term impact on the general fund. However, the measure now includes the issuance of $12,900,000 in general obligation bonds, which will create a new long-term obligation for the state in the form of debt service payments over the life of the bonds. The $1,750,000 annual appropriation for legal services grants remains a new recurring cost.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "This measure now authorizes $12,900,000 in capital expenditures for FY 2026, an increase of $3,000,000 from the prior version. The funds are allocated for the design of a new South Kohala District Courthouse ($4,000,000), a chiller replacement at the Kauai Judiciary Complex ($900,000), and a lump sum for statewide judiciary facility improvements ($8,000,000). This represents a new and significant capital investment not detailed in the previous fiscal note.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The ongoing general fund operating costs will be approximately $4.5 million lower annually compared to the previous version of the bill. However, the State will incur new, long-term debt service obligations resulting from the $12,900,000 bond issuance for capital projects. The $1,750,000 annual cost for legal services grants continues as a permanent addition to the Judiciary's base budget.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The primary update from H.B. 400, S.D. 1, is a significant budgetary shift made by the Senate Ways and Means Committee in S.D. 2. The general fund operating budget was reduced by approximately $4.5 million annually (from ~$203.3M to ~$198.8M for FY26). Conversely, the Capital Improvement Project budget was increased by $3 million (from $9.9M to $12.9M) in general obligation bond funds to accelerate projects like the South Kohala Courthouse design. The specific appropriations totaling $1.75 million for civil and immigration legal services remain intact."
