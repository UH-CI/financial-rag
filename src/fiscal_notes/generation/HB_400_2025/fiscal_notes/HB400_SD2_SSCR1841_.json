  "overview": "This measure was amended to adjust the Judiciary's biennial budget, resulting in a net decrease to the general fund operating budget while increasing the capital improvement project appropriations. The total CIP appropriation was increased by $3,000,000 over the introduced version to $12,900,000 for fiscal year 2025-2026. While funding for civil and immigration legal services was retained, the overall operating budget reflects a reduction from the amounts in the previously considered version of the bill.",
  "appropriations": "The appropriation for Capital Improvement Projects (CIP) was increased to $12,900,000 in general obligation bond funds for FY 2025-2026, a $3,000,000 increase over the introduced bill. This includes $4,000,000 for the South Kohala District Courthouse design, $900,000 for a chiller replacement in Kauai, and an $8,000,000 lump sum for statewide facility improvements. Conversely, the total general fund operating appropriation was set at $198,782,736 for FY 2025-2026 and $198,855,327 for FY 2026-2027, which is a net decrease from the total amounts considered in prior versions.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The methodology for the capital budget adjustment involves incorporating specific project requests from the Judiciary and increasing the lump sum allocation. The increase is based on testimony indicating a shortfall for the O'ahu Children's Justice Center relocation and other emergent facility needs. This reflects an assumption that addressing aging infrastructure, such as the South Kohala Courthouse and a chiller in Kauai, is a high priority.",
  "agency_impact": "The reduction in the total operating budget may require the Judiciary to re-evaluate its staffing and program expansion plans, potentially deferring some of the requests outlined in its testimony. However, the increased CIP funding will allow the Judiciary to proceed with critical infrastructure projects, including the design of a new South Kohala courthouse and addressing a funding shortfall for the Children's Justice Center relocation. This shifts the immediate focus from operational expansion to capital renewal.",
  "economic_impact": "The increased capital improvement funding of $12,900,000 will stimulate the local economy through construction and design contracts. Projects like the new South Kohala District Courthouse are expected to improve public access to justice, reducing costs and time for residents in the North and South Kohala districts. This investment in public infrastructure is intended to generate long-term economic benefits through improved government efficiency and community services.",
  "policy_impact": "This amended version of the bill signals a legislative prioritization of capital infrastructure renewal over the full funding of the Judiciary's requested operational increases. While maintaining new commitments to legal services, the adjustments indicate a policy of addressing deferred maintenance and critical facility needs as a primary concern. This approach balances new program funding with long-term investment in physical assets.",
  "revenue_sources": "",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The appropriation of $4,000,000 for the design and planning of the new South Kohala District Courthouse represents the initial phase of a major multi-year capital project. This will create significant future fiscal obligations for construction and outfitting, which will appear in subsequent biennial budgets. The full construction cost is not yet determined but will likely be a substantial capital request within the next six years. Upon completion, the new courthouse will also require a permanent increase to the Judiciary's operating budget to cover staffing, security, and maintenance for a larger, modern facility. Similarly, the $8,000,000 lump sum CIP allocation addresses immediate needs but points to a sustained requirement for future funding to manage a statewide portfolio of aging buildings. The reduction in the current operating budget base may also impact the Judiciary's long-term ability to absorb inflationary costs and expand services. This could lead to larger, more acute funding requests in future years to address deferred operational needs. The six-year outlook therefore shows a shift in fiscal pressure from immediate operating costs to long-term capital liabilities and the future operating costs that will follow the completion of these capital projects. This budget commits the state to a significant future capital investment pipeline for the Judiciary.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "This measure now appropriates a total of $12,900,000 in general obligation bond funds for capital expenditures in fiscal year 2025-2026. These funds are allocated for three specific projects: $4,000,000 for the plans and design of a new South Kohala District Courthouse, $900,000 for a chiller replacement at the Kauai Judiciary Complex, and $8,000,000 for lump sum improvements to Judiciary facilities statewide. This represents a significant increase in capital investment compared to the bill's introduced version.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "After the initial six-year period, the state will face the ongoing operational and maintenance costs for the new South Kohala District Courthouse, once constructed. This will include staffing, utilities, and lifecycle maintenance for a significantly larger facility than the one it replaces. The initial capital investment in courthouse planning creates a long-term fiscal obligation for both its construction and its subsequent annual operating budget.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The primary update from the previous fiscal note is the amendment by the Senate Committee on Ways and Means, which significantly altered the Judiciary's budget appropriations. The capital improvement project (CIP) budget was increased by $3,000,000 to a total of $12,900,000, funding the design of a new South Kohala courthouse and other facility upgrades. Conversely, the overall general fund operating budget was reduced to $198.8 million for FY 2026, a decrease from the total requested amount, even while preserving the previously added $1.75 million for civil and immigration legal services. This reflects a legislative decision to prioritize infrastructure investment while constraining growth in the operating budget."
