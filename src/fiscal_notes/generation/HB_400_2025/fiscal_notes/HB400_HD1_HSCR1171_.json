  "overview": "House Bill 400 appropriates operating and capital improvement funds for the Judiciary for the 2025-2027 fiscal biennium. The bill addresses funding for specialty courts, cybersecurity upgrades, staffing for the new Wahiawā District Court, and various infrastructure projects. The House Committee on Finance has since amended the measure, confirming updated appropriation amounts and changing the effective date to encourage further discussion.",
  "appropriations": "The House Committee on Finance amended the bill, confirming total operating appropriations from all means of financing at $216,164,762 for FY 2026 and $216,237,353 for FY 2027. This includes general fund appropriations of $203,319,009 and $203,391,600 for FY 2026 and FY 2027, respectively. The capital improvement budget for FY 2026 is formally set at $11,900,000 in general obligation bond funds.",

  "agency_impact": "",
  "economic_impact": "Testimonies from multiple community legal service providers, including the Legal Aid Society of Hawaiʻi and The Legal Clinic, advocate for an additional $1,000,000 for the civil legal services line item. This increase is requested to address the significant unmet need for legal assistance among low-income residents and to mitigate the impact of potential reductions in federal funding. These organizations serve as a critical safety net for vulnerable populations facing issues like eviction and domestic violence.",
  "policy_impact": "The House Committee on Finance amended the bill to change the effective date to July 1, 3000. This procedural move indicates that the measure is not in its final form and is intended to ensure further deliberation and discussion, likely in conference committee. This change does not affect the substance of the appropriations but rather its legislative pathway.",
  "revenue_sources": "The amended bill formally authorizes the issuance of general obligation bonds not to exceed $11,900,000 to finance the Judiciary's capital improvement projects for FY 2026. This confirms the previously recommended increase from the Judiciary's initial request. Other programs will continue to be funded primarily through general fund appropriations as specified in the committee report.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The fiscal outlook for the initial biennium is now formally established by the House Committee on Finance, with operating costs from all funds at $216.2 million in FY 2026 and $216.2 million in FY 2027, and a one-time capital expenditure of $11.9 million in FY 2026. The budget request includes converting temporary positions for programs like the Women's Court into permanent ones, which would establish recurring personnel costs beyond the biennium. Furthermore, testimony from legal aid organizations introduced a new request for an additional $1 million in recurring annual funding for civil legal services, which, if approved, would increase future operating budgets.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The capital expenditure for FY 2026 has been officially set at $11,900,000 in the amended bill. This amount is allocated to three specific projects: $4,000,000 for the design of a new South Kohala District Courthouse, $900,000 for a chiller replacement at the Kauai Judiciary Complex, and a $7,000,000 lump sum for statewide facility improvements. The lump sum appropriation includes the $2 million increase designated for the relocation of the Children’s Justice Center on O‘ahu.",
