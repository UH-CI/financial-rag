  "overview": "House Bill No. 400 appropriates funds for the Judiciary for the 2025–2027 biennium. The purpose of this measure is to appropriate funds for the operating and capital improvement costs of the Judiciary Branch for fiscal biennium 2025-2027. Operating resource requests center around funding to make permanent or expand three Specialty Courts on O‘ahu, to fully staff the new Wahiawā District Court, an additional District Court Judge and support staff in Kona, cybersecurity and critical technology costs, funding for the Criminal Justice Research Institute (CJRI), and restoration of funding for essential staffing that was defunded during the early part of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
  "appropriations": "The Judiciary requests additional operating resources in the amount of $6.17M in FY 2026 (HB400_TESTIMONY_FIN_03-05-25_.PDF.txt), and $6.25M in FY 2027 (HB400_TESTIMONY_FIN_03-05-25_.PDF.txt). As amended, this measure appropriates general funds for operating costs of $203,319,009 (HB400_HD1_HSCR1171_.PDF.txt) in FY 2025-2026 and $203,391,600 (HB400_HD1_HSCR1171_.PDF.txt) in FY 2026-2027. For Capital Improvements in FY 2025-2026, the measure appropriates $11,900,000 (HB400_HD1_HSCR1171_.PDF.txt) from general obligation bonds.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The Judiciary's budget request is based on current circumstances and projected resource needs for the future. Resource requests are based on making pilot programs permanent, such as the Women's Court Pilot Project which is set to expire at the end of FY 2025. Other requests are based on the need to fully staff new facilities like the Wahiawā District Court, which will open to the public in Spring 2026, and to restore funding for positions that were defunded during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
  "agency_impact": "The measure will provide the Judiciary with additional operating resources for 17.0 permanent FTE and 1.0 temporary FTE. Nine of the 18 positions are requested to continue current staffing for programs like the Women’s Court Pilot Project and the Criminal Justice Research Institute (CJRI). The remaining requested positions will significantly expand capacity to certain operations, including staffing for an additional District Court Judge in Kona and positions at the new Wahiawā District Court.",
  "economic_impact": "The Women's Court program aims to prevent re-entry into criminality and to aid participants in bettering their economic conditions and life circumstances. The addition of a Kona District Court Judge is needed to address an extraordinary caseload of nearly 16,000 cases annually (HB400_TESTIMONY_FIN_03-05-25_.PDF.txt), which has led to unsustainable court congestion and delays. Several testimonies support an increase of an additional $1,000,000.00 (HB400_TESTIMONY_FIN_03-05-25_.PDF.txt) for civil legal services to meet the needs of low-income residents.",
  "policy_impact": "This measure will establish a permanent Women’s Court, also known as Mohala Wahine, to address the rapid growth in the incarceration of women. It will also make the Driving While Impaired (DWI) Court Program permanent, which seeks to reduce recidivism among repeat and high-risk offenders. The bill continues funding for the Criminal Justice Research Institute (CJRI) to continue its work to establish a centralized statewide criminal pretrial justice data reporting and collection system.",
