  "overview": "House Bill 400 is the Judiciary Appropriations Act of 2025, providing operating and capital improvement funds for the fiscal biennium 2025–2027. The measure appropriates general funds and bond funds to support key Judiciary initiatives. These include making permanent several pilot specialty courts, staffing the new Wahiawā District Court, adding a new District Court Judge in Kona, enhancing cybersecurity infrastructure, and restoring positions that were defunded during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
  "appropriations": "The Judiciary requests additional operating resources totaling $6.17 million in FY 2026 and $6.25 million in FY 2027, which includes funding for 17.0 permanent and 1.0 temporary full-time equivalent (FTE) positions. These funds are designated for specific programmatic needs, including establishing a permanent Women’s Court ($705,416 annually), expanding the Truancy Court and Early Education Intervention Program ($188,388 in FY 2026), and making the Driving While Impaired (DWI) Court Program permanent ($232,412 in FY 2026). Additionally, significant appropriations are allocated for staffing and operating the new Wahiawā District Court and funding a new Kona District Court Judge and support staff ($368,943 in FY 2026).",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "Fiscal projections are based on specific operational needs and external data points. For instance, the request for a new Kona District Court Judge is justified by a doubling of the region's population over the last forty years and a current annual caseload of nearly 16,000 cases handled by a single judge. Cybersecurity upgrade costs are based on a direct quote for upgrading email subscriptions to Microsoft M365 G5, aligning the Judiciary's security posture with that of the State's Executive Branch. Staffing costs for the new Wahiawā courthouse are timed to coincide with its planned opening in Spring 2026.",
  "agency_impact": "The measure will enable the Judiciary to transition successful pilot programs, such as the Women’s Court and DWI Court, into permanent operations, ensuring their long-term stability and impact. It provides the necessary resources to fully staff and operate the new Wahiawā District Court, expanding access to justice for residents in West and Central O‘ahu. The addition of a new judgeship in Kona will directly address court congestion and delays, while restored funding for positions across all circuits will alleviate staffing shortages and improve the efficiency of court operations.",
  "economic_impact": "The specialty court programs funded by this measure are designed to generate positive economic outcomes by reducing recidivism and addressing root causes of criminal behavior. The Women's Court, for example, aims to help participants improve their economic conditions as an alternative to incarceration, potentially reducing long-term costs to the state. Similarly, the DWI Court's focus on repeat offenders can lead to safer roadways and fewer costs associated with impaired driving incidents, while the Truancy Court's early intervention may improve educational attainment and future earning potential for at-risk youth.",
  "policy_impact": "This appropriations bill codifies a policy shift towards therapeutic justice by providing permanent funding for specialty courts that serve as alternatives to traditional incarceration. It addresses long-standing judicial workload issues driven by population growth, particularly in Kona, ensuring the Judiciary can meet its service obligations. The continued funding for the Criminal Justice Research Institute (CJRI) reinforces the state's commitment to data-driven analysis and reform within the criminal justice system.",
  "revenue_sources": "The operating expenses for the Judiciary are primarily funded through General Funds (Means of Financing 'A'). Capital improvement projects are funded by General Obligation Bond Funds (Means of Financing 'C'). The bill also authorizes expenditures from Special Funds (Means of Financing 'B') and Revolving Funds (Means of Financing 'W') for specific administrative and programmatic purposes.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The requested operating budget increases of approximately $6.2 million per year are largely for recurring personnel and operational costs, which will establish a higher funding baseline for the Judiciary beyond the 2025-2027 biennium. The 17.0 new permanent positions for the Women’s Court, DWI Court, Kona judgeship, Wahiawā court staffing, and other programs represent an ongoing annual salary and benefit cost. Technology upgrades, such as the $1.175 million annual cost for Microsoft M365 G5 email subscriptions, will require recurring licensing fees. Other technology costs, like the initial $560,000 for network switches in FY 2026 and $420,000 in FY 2027, will necessitate periodic replacement expenses in future fiscal plans to maintain network reliability. The continuation of the Criminal Justice Research Institute also establishes an ongoing operational cost to support its data collection and analysis functions. These increased costs are expected to be sustained in the out-years to maintain the expanded level of judicial services.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The provided legislative documents and testimony do not describe any anticipated impacts on the Judiciary's operating revenues as a result of this measure.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The House Committee on Finance amended the bill to appropriate a total of $11.9 million in general obligation bond funds for FY 2026. This total includes $7.0 million in lump sum funds for statewide facility improvements, which incorporates an additional $2.0 million specifically requested by the Judiciary to address a projected cost overrun for the relocation of the Children’s Justice Center on Oʻahu. The CIP budget also allocates $4.0 million for the planning and design of a new South Kohala District Courthouse on Hawaiʻi Island and $900,000 to replace an aging A/C chiller at the Puʻuhonua Kaulike complex on Kauaʻi.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The permanent establishment of new programs and staffing, including the specialty courts and the new judicial position in Kona, will create ongoing fiscal obligations for personnel and operational support beyond the six-year planning horizon. Technology modernizations, particularly cybersecurity enhancements, will require continuous funding for licensing, maintenance, and future upgrades. These costs will require sustained general fund appropriations to maintain the Judiciary's expanded operational capacity and infrastructure.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "This fiscal note provides a comprehensive analysis of the Judiciary's primary budget request, which was absent in the previous version. Key new information includes the specific operating cost increases ($6.17 million in FY26, $6.25 million in FY27) and the detailed programmatic justifications, such as making specialty courts permanent, staffing new facilities, and enhancing cybersecurity. While the previous note identified the capital budget increase to $11.9 million, this note adds a detailed breakdown of the projects this funding supports, including the South Kohala courthouse design and the Kauaʻi chiller replacement, in addition to the previously mentioned Children's Justice Center relocation."
