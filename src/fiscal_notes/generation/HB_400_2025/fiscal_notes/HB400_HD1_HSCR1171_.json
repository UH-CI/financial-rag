  "overview": "This measure appropriates funds for the Judiciary's fiscal biennium 2025-2027, seeking substantial operating increases to make pilot programs like the Women's Court permanent, fully staff the new Wahiawā District Court, and add a new District Court Judge in Kona. It also allocates significant capital improvement funds for statewide projects, including designing a new courthouse in South Kohala and relocating the Children's Justice Center on Oʻahu. The requests address growing caseloads, aging infrastructure, and the need for enhanced cybersecurity.",
  "appropriations": "As amended in H.B. 400 H.D. 1, the measure now appropriates $11,900,000 in general obligation bond funds for capital improvement projects for fiscal year 2026. This represents a $2,000,000 increase from the bill as introduced, reflecting the full amount requested by the Judiciary. The bill also appropriates general funds for operating costs totaling $203,319,009 in FY 2026 and $203,391,600 in FY 2027.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "Financial projections are based on detailed analyses of operational needs, including the transition of temporary pilot programs (Women's Court, DWI Court) to permanent status with associated staffing costs. Cost estimates for the new Wahiawā District Court are based on requirements for full-time staffing and security in a new facility, while the need for a new Kona judge is justified by a caseload of nearly 16,000 cases annually handled by a single judge. The increased capital request for the Children's Justice Center is based on new cost estimates recently received by the Judiciary.",
  "agency_impact": "The Judiciary anticipates a significant expansion of services and staff, requesting an additional 17.0 permanent and 1.0 temporary FTEs to support new and expanded programs. This includes establishing a permanent Women’s Court, staffing a new Kona judgeship, and ensuring the new Wahiawā District Court is fully operational. The budget also provides for a dedicated cybersecurity team and technology upgrades, increasing the Judiciary's capacity to manage modern operational demands and security threats.",
  "economic_impact": "The Judiciary's budget request aims to generate long-term cost savings by reducing recidivism and incarceration through specialty courts like the Women's Court and DWI Court, which provide treatment as an alternative to incarceration. The Truancy Court program is designed to improve school attendance, potentially leading to better long-term economic outcomes for students. Additionally, testimony from legal aid providers continues to advocate for a $1,000,000 funding increase, arguing it prevents more costly societal outcomes by addressing civil legal issues for low-income residents.",
  "policy_impact": "This measure advances a policy of institutionalizing therapeutic justice models by converting successful pilot programs like the Women's Court into permanent state functions. It also reflects a commitment to improving access to justice in underserved and growing rural communities by funding a new judge in Kona and a new courthouse in South Kohala. Continued funding for the Criminal Justice Research Institute supports the state's policy of using data-driven analysis to inform criminal justice reform.",
  "revenue_sources": "The operating budget increases, totaling approximately $6.2 million annually, are funded from the State's General Fund. All capital improvement projects, totaling $11,900,000 in FY 2026, are to be funded through the issuance of General Obligation Bonds. The Judiciary's testimony notes that some programs, such as the DWI Court, were initially supported by federal grants, highlighting a reliance on a mix of state and federal funds for certain initiatives.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The budget establishes significant new recurring costs that will become part of the Judiciary's base budget. This includes annual operating expenses of $6,170,000 in FY 2026 and $6,250,000 in FY 2027, along with 18 new positions. Key ongoing costs include the permanent establishment of the Women's Court ($705,416 annually), the DWI Court (approx. $235,000 annually), and security contracts for the new Wahiawā courthouse ($346,209 in FY26, rising to $486,967 in FY27). A major recurring expense is the requested $1,175,300 annually for enhanced cybersecurity email subscriptions. The request also restores funding for numerous positions that were defunded during the pandemic, solidifying these costs for the long term. The $11.9 million in G.O. bonds will create new debt service obligations for the state over the life of the bonds.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The capital expenditure appropriation has been finalized in H.B. 400 H.D. 1 at $11,900,000 in General Obligation Bond funds for FY 2026. This is a change from the previously recommended lump sum and now includes specific allocations: $4,000,000 for the design of a new South Kohala District Courthouse, $900,000 for an A/C chiller replacement on Kauaʻi, and a $7,000,000 lump sum for other statewide projects. This lump sum explicitly includes the $2,000,000 increase needed for the Oʻahu Children's Justice Center relocation.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The permanent establishment of new court programs and staffing levels will create ongoing fiscal obligations of over $6.2 million annually beyond the initial biennium. These costs for personnel, program operations, and technology subscriptions, such as the $1.175 million for cybersecurity, will become a permanent part of the Judiciary's base budget. The state will also be responsible for long-term debt service payments on the $11.9 million in GO bonds issued for capital improvements.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The capital improvement project (CIP) funding has been finalized in H.B. 400 H.D. 1, with the appropriation increasing to a specific $11,900,000 in General Obligation bonds, reflecting the House Finance Committee's approval of the Judiciary's full request. This appropriation is now broken down into specific projects, including $4,000,000 for the South Kohala Courthouse design and a $7,000,000 lump sum that incorporates the $2,000,000 increase for the Children's Justice Center relocation. Furthermore, the Judiciary's full operating budget request has now been detailed, specifying an increase of $6.17M in FY 2026 and $6.25M in FY 2027 for 18 FTEs and various program expansions, information not specified previously."
