  "overview": "This measure appropriates funds for the Judiciary for the 2025–2027 biennium. [4] Operating resource requests center around funding to make permanent or expand three Specialty Courts on O‘ahu, to fully staff the new Wahiawā District Court that will open during this biennium, an additional District Court Judge and support staff in Kona, cybersecurity and critical technology costs, funding for the Criminal Justice Research Institute (CJRI), and restoration of funding for essential staffing that was defunded during the early part of the COVID-19 pandemic. [4] The purpose of this measure is to appropriate funds for the operating and capital improvement costs of the Judiciary Branch for fiscal biennium 2025-2027. [6]",
  "appropriations": "The Judiciary requests additional operating resources in the amount of $6.17M in FY 2026, and $6.25M in FY 2027. [4] As amended, this measure appropriates $11,900,000 (HB400_HD1_HSCR1171_.pdf) in General Obligation Bonds for Capital Improvements in FY 2025-2026. [6] Testimony from The Legal Clinic supports the current budget of $1.2 million (HB400_TESTIMONY_FIN_03-05-25_.PDF.txt) and an increase of an additional $1 million (HB400_TESTIMONY_FIN_03-05-25_.PDF.txt) to the Judiciary’s civil legal services fund. [4]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The Judiciary's budget request is based on current circumstances and projected resource needs for the future. [4] Cost estimations are based on making pilot programs permanent, such as the Women's Court which is set to expire at the end of FY 2025. [4] The methodology also includes costs for staffing new facilities like the Wahiawā District Court, which will open to the public in Spring 2026, and restoring funding for selected positions defunded during the early part of the pandemic. [4] [4]",
  "agency_impact": "The appropriations would allow the Judiciary to establish a permanent Women’s Court with 8.0 FTE permanent positions. [4] It would significantly expand the Truancy Court and EEIP on O‘ahu and make the DWI Court Program permanent. [4] [4] Additionally, the funding will fully staff the new Wahiawā District Court, add a District Court Judge in Kona to address an extraordinary caseload, and create a dedicated cybersecurity staff. [4] [4] [4]",
  "economic_impact": "The goal of the Women's Court program is to aid the participants in bettering their economic conditions and life circumstances. [4] Securing permanent funding for the DWI Court Program would allow it to continue to provide accountability and monitoring of the treatment and recovery process for repeat and high-risk offenders, potentially reducing recidivism. [4] Testimony from Volunteer Legal Services Hawai‘i highlights that there are many unmet legal needs for low-income residents facing critical issues, like landlord/tenant or child custody issues, and requests an increase in funding for civil legal services. [4] [4]",
  "policy_impact": "This measure transitions the Women’s Court Pilot Project, established in July of 2022, into a permanent Women's Court. [4] [4] It also secures permanent funding for the Driving While Impaired (DWI) Court Program, which has been operational since 2013 with initial federal funding. [4] [4] The bill reverses a pandemic-era policy by restoring funding for selected defunded positions that were removed from the Judiciary's budget to help the State's economic crisis at that time. [4] [4]",

[4] [4]",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "Establishing a permanent Women’s Court and making the DWI Court Program permanent will create ongoing operational costs beyond the initial biennium. [4] [4] Restoring funding for various essential staff positions that were previously defunded will also result in recurring expenses in future fiscal years. [4] These ongoing fiscal obligations will require continued appropriations to maintain the expanded services and staffing levels. [4]",

[6] The measure now appropriates $11,900,000 (HB400_HD1_HSCR1171_.pdf) in General Obligation Bonds, an increase from the previously mentioned $9.9 million request and different from the $7 million consideration in the prior fiscal note.
