The purpose of this measure is to appropriate funds for the operating and capital improvement costs of the Judiciary Branch for fiscal biennium 2025-2027. Operating resource requests center around funding to make permanent or expand three Specialty Courts on O‘ahu, to fully staff the new Wahiawā District Court, an additional District Court Judge and support staff in Kona, cybersecurity and critical technology costs, funding for the Criminal Justice Research Institute (CJRI), and restoration of funding for essential staffing that was defunded during the early part of the COVID-19 pandemic.\",\n\"appropriations\": \"The Judiciary requests additional operating resources in the amount of $6.17M in FY 2026 (HB400_TESTIMONY_FIN_03-05-25_.PDF.txt), and $6.25M in FY 2027 (HB400_TESTIMONY_FIN_03-05-25_.PDF.txt).
