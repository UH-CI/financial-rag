The bill reflects the Judiciary’s resource requirements, which center around funding to make permanent or expand three Specialty Courts on O‘ahu, to fully staff the new Wahiawā District Court, add a District Court Judge in Kona, cover cybersecurity costs, and restore funding for essential staffing. The bill's purpose is to appropriate funds for the Judiciary for the fiscal biennium beginning 7/1/2025, and ending 6/30/2027.\",\n\"appropriations\": \"The Judiciary requests additional operating resources in the amount of $6.17M (HB400) in FY 2026, and $6.25M (HB400) in FY 2027, for 17.0 permanent FTE and 1.0 temporary FTE. The Judiciary also requests a total of $11.9M (HB400) in bond funds for capital improvement projects in FY 2026. These funds are intended for staffing, making pilot programs permanent, technology upgrades, and restoring positions defunded during the pandemic.\",\n\"assumptions_and_methodology\": \"The fiscal projections are based on current circumstances and projected resource needs for the future. Cost estimations are detailed for specific requests, such as continuing programs with expiring funding like the Women’s Court Pilot Project and the Criminal Justice Research Institute.

It provides funding to make the Women's Court and DWI Court permanent, fully staff the new Wahiawā District Court, and add a much-needed District Court Judge in Kona. These resources will significantly expand capacity to certain operations and restore funding for positions critical to operations.\",\n\"economic_impact\": \"The Women’s Court program's goal is to aid participants in bettering their economic conditions and life circumstances and prevent re-entry into criminality. The Driving While Impaired (DWI) Court Program seeks to reduce recidivism among repeat and high-risk offenders by addressing the underlying cause of impaired driving. Additionally, the Truancy Court and Early Education Intervention Program aims to address chronic school truancy, which supports long-term academic and economic success for students.\",\n\"policy_impact\": \"This bill makes permanent the Women’s Court Pilot Project, which was established by the Legislature in July of 2022 (Act 243/22) with funding for a three-year pilot. It also seeks permanent funding for the DWI Court Program, which was initially supported by federal funding.
