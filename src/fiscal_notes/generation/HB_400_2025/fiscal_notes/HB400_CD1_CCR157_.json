  "overview": "This measure, as finalized by the Conference Committee, appropriates funds for the Judiciary's operating and capital costs for the 2025-2027 biennium. The final version restores a portion of the general fund operating budget that was reduced in the previous Senate draft. Specifically, it appropriates over $201 million from general funds for FY 2026 operations while maintaining the previously approved $12.9 million capital improvement budget.",
  "appropriations": "As amended, the bill appropriates general funds for operations totaling $201,725,676 for FY 2026 and $199,579,345 for FY 2027. This represents an increase of approximately $2.94 million in the first year and $0.72 million in the second year compared to the amounts in the S.D. 2 version. The capital improvement appropriation of $12,900,000 in general obligation bonds for FY 2026 remains unchanged.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The final appropriations are the result of Conference Committee negotiations between the House and Senate, reflecting a compromise on the Judiciary's budgetary needs. The methodology involved adjusting the general fund totals upward from the S.D. 2 version to address operational requirements. These final figures supersede previous calculations and are based on the committee's final agreement.",
  "agency_impact": "The restoration of approximately $3.7 million in general funds over the biennium will provide the Judiciary with greater capacity to meet its operational requirements compared to the previous version of the bill. This additional funding may allow the agency to proceed with filling positions or funding programs that were at risk under the prior, more restrictive budget. The impact related to managing the capital improvement budget is unchanged.",
  "economic_impact": "The primary change in economic impact results from the increased operating budget, which supports a higher level of state expenditure on Judiciary personnel and services. This contributes to maintaining stable employment and operational capacity within the judicial system. The previously described economic benefits from the $12.9 million capital investment are not altered by this version.",
  "policy_impact": "This final version reflects a legislative policy compromise, moving from a strong prioritization of capital projects towards a more balanced approach that also supports ongoing judicial operations. By restoring operating funds, the Legislature affirms the importance of maintaining the Judiciary's day-to-day functions in addition to addressing infrastructure needs. This represents a moderated fiscal policy compared to the more austere operating budget proposed in the S.D. 2.",
  "revenue_sources": "The sources of funding are unchanged, with the General Fund supporting operations and General Obligation Bonds funding capital improvements. This final version, however, authorizes a higher level of expenditure from the General Fund for the Judiciary's operating budget. The amount of financing from G.O. Bonds remains consistent with the previous version.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The six-year fiscal outlook is now higher than anticipated in the prior fiscal note due to the restoration of operating funds. The Judiciary's recurring general fund base budget is set to increase by an additional $2,942,940 in FY 2026 and $724,018 in FY 2027 compared to the S.D. 2 version. This adjustment reverses some of the cost-saving moderation seen in the previous draft, as this higher expenditure level is expected to carry forward into future budget calculations. The long-term debt service obligation resulting from the issuance of $12,900,000 in general obligation bonds remains a consistent fiscal implication over the life of the bonds. These debt payments will constitute a recurring state liability for approximately 20 years. Therefore, the state's total long-term obligation under this measure has increased due to the combination of higher recurring operating costs and the previously established debt service. The overall fiscal impact is now greater than that projected in the S.D. 2 version.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "After the initial six-year period, the Judiciary's ongoing general fund operating costs will be permanently higher than projected under the S.D. 2 version due to the restored base budget amounts. The state will also continue to make long-term debt service payments on the $12.9 million in bonds issued for capital projects. Consequently, the measure establishes a higher floor for future Judiciary budgets.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The primary update from the S.D. 2 version is the Conference Committee's decision to increase the Judiciary's general fund operating budget. Appropriations were increased by approximately $2.94 million in FY 2026 (to $201,725,676) and by $0.72 million in FY 2027 (to $199,579,345). The capital improvement budget, funded with $12,900,000 in general obligation bonds for FY 2026, was not changed."
