  "policy_impact": "The most significant policy change in this final version is the amendment of the effective date to July 1, 2025. This replaces the previous defective date of July 1, 2050, which was intended to facilitate further legislative negotiation. The new, non-defective effective date signifies that the legislature has reached a final agreement and intends for the appropriations to be implemented for the specified fiscal biennium.",

  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The operating budget baseline for the Judiciary has been increased from the amounts cited in the previous version. The new general fund figures are $201,725,676 for FY 2025-2026 and $199,579,345 for FY 2026-2027. These updated amounts will serve as the new baseline for projecting the Judiciary's operating costs in subsequent fiscal years. This represents an increase of approximately $2.94 million in the first year and $0.72 million in the second year over the previously reported Senate Ways and Means Committee version. The capital improvement project funding and its associated debt service implications remain unchanged from the previous fiscal note. All other provisions related to the transfer of funds and management of federal funds are standard for an appropriations act. The bill does not introduce new programs with long-term cost drivers beyond the established operational and capital funding.",
