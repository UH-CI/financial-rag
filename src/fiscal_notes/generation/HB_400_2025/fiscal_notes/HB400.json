  "overview": "House Bill 400, House Draft 1, appropriates operating and capital improvement funds for the Judiciary for the 2025–2027 fiscal biennium. The measure funds requests to make certain specialty court pilot programs permanent, fully staff the new Wahiawā District Court, add a new judge and staff in Kona, and upgrade critical technology and cybersecurity infrastructure. It also seeks to restore funding for various positions that were defunded during the COVID-19 pandemic to address current operational needs.",
  "appropriations": "The Judiciary requests additional operating funds of $6.17 million in Fiscal Year (FY) 2026 and $6.25 million in FY 2027, supporting 17.0 permanent and 1.0 temporary full-time equivalent (FTE) positions. These appropriations are intended for staffing specialty courts, the Wahiawā and Kona courts, cybersecurity personnel, and restoring critical positions. Additionally, the bill requests $11.9 million in bond funds in FY 2026 for capital improvement projects, including courthouse design and facility repairs.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal projections are based on projected resource needs to address increased caseloads, expand services, and modernize operations. Cost calculations for personnel are based on established salary schedules, with partial-year funding requested for positions starting mid-year, such as for the Wahiawā court. Technology costs are based on specific needs, such as upgrading to Microsoft M365 G5 email subscriptions and replacing end-of-life network equipment, while capital project estimates are based on initial planning and known funding shortfalls.",
  "agency_impact": "This measure will significantly expand the Judiciary's operational capacity by establishing permanent specialty courts, enhancing services in rural communities like Wahiawā and Kona, and improving technological security. The additional staffing will help alleviate unsustainable workloads on existing personnel, reduce case backlogs, and ensure facilities are properly maintained and secured. These resources are critical for the Judiciary to meet its constitutional mandate and improve access to justice statewide.",
  "economic_impact": "The funding is expected to generate positive economic effects by improving the efficiency of the justice system and reducing long-term societal costs. Specialty courts, such as the Women's Court and DWI Court, aim to reduce recidivism, while the Truancy Court program supports educational attainment, potentially leading to better economic outcomes for participants. Additionally, ensuring access to civil legal services for low-income individuals, as supported by various testimonies, can prevent costly issues like homelessness and family separation.",
  "policy_impact": "The bill advances the Judiciary's policy of enhancing access to justice by making successful pilot programs like the Women's Court permanent and expanding judicial resources to underserved, high-growth areas. It reinforces the state's commitment to data-driven criminal justice reform by providing continued funding for the Criminal Justice Research Institute. The measure also addresses operational deficiencies that arose from pandemic-era budget cuts, restoring the Judiciary's capacity to fulfill its core functions.",
  "revenue_sources": "The operating budget requests, totaling approximately $12.42 million over the biennium, are to be funded from the State's general funds. The capital improvement project costs, amounting to $11.9 million in FY 2026, are requested as general obligation bond funds. The documents do not identify any other revenue sources, such as grants or fees, to support these specific budget requests.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The six-year fiscal outlook indicates significant recurring costs beyond the initial 2025-2027 biennium. The bill requests operating funds of $6.17 million in FY 2026 and $6.25 million in FY 2027, primarily for personnel and technology, which will become part of the Judiciary's base budget. These annual costs are expected to continue and increase over time due to salary adjustments and inflation. Key recurring expenses include approximately $705,000 annually for the Women's Court, over $1 million annually for the new Wahiawā District Court, $360,000 annually for the Kona District Court expansion, and over $2 million annually for cybersecurity and technology upgrades. The 17.0 permanent FTE positions create an ongoing payroll obligation. Capital expenditures include a one-time appropriation of $11.9 million in bond funds in FY 2026 for projects like the South Kohala Courthouse design ($4 million) and other statewide needs. While this is a one-time authorization, the new and renovated facilities will incur future operational and maintenance costs not detailed in this request. The establishment of permanent programs and staffing ensures these fiscal implications will extend well beyond the six-year period.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The measure is not anticipated to have a direct impact on the Judiciary's operating revenues. The bill concerns appropriations for expenditures and does not introduce new fees, fines, or other revenue-generating mechanisms. Therefore, no significant increase or decrease in operating revenue is expected as a result of this bill.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The bill requests a total of $11.9 million in capital improvement project (CIP) bond funds for FY 2026. These funds are designated for specific capital expenditures, including $4.0 million for the design of a new South Kohala District Courthouse to address safety and capacity issues. An additional $900,000 is requested to replace an A/C chiller in Kauaʻi, and $7.0 million is requested as a lump sum for statewide building repairs and to cover a projected $2.0 million shortfall for the relocation of the Children’s Justice Center on Oʻahu.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "After the initial six-year period, the state will have an ongoing fiscal obligation to support the programs and positions made permanent by this bill. The annual operating costs, exceeding $6.2 million, for staffing, technology, and program administration are expected to continue indefinitely and will likely increase with inflation and collective bargaining agreements. The Judiciary will be reliant on sustained general fund appropriations to maintain the expanded court services and enhanced security measures established by this measure.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "Not applicable. No previous fiscal note was provided for comparison."
