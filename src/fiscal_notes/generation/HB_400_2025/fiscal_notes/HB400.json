  "overview": "House Bill No. 400, House Draft 1, appropriates funds for the Judiciary for the 2025–2027 biennium. The bill reflects the Judiciary’s resource requirements, which center around funding to make permanent or expand three Specialty Courts on O‘ahu, to fully staff the new Wahiawā District Court, add a District Court Judge in Kona, cover cybersecurity costs, and restore funding for essential staffing. The bill's purpose is to appropriate funds for the Judiciary for the fiscal biennium beginning 7/1/2025, and ending 6/30/2027.",
  "appropriations": "The Judiciary requests additional operating resources in the amount of $6.17M (HB400) in FY 2026, and $6.25M (HB400) in FY 2027, for 17.0 permanent FTE and 1.0 temporary FTE. The Judiciary also requests a total of $11.9M (HB400) in bond funds for capital improvement projects in FY 2026. These funds are intended for staffing, making pilot programs permanent, technology upgrades, and restoring positions defunded during the pandemic.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal projections are based on current circumstances and projected resource needs for the future. Cost estimations are detailed for specific requests, such as continuing programs with expiring funding like the Women’s Court Pilot Project and the Criminal Justice Research Institute. The methodology involves itemizing costs for new positions, technology subscriptions, contracted services, and restoring funding for positions that were previously defunded.",
  "agency_impact": "The measure will allow the Judiciary to fill 17.0 permanent FTE and 1.0 temporary FTE (HB400) to continue and expand critical operations. It provides funding to make the Women's Court and DWI Court permanent, fully staff the new Wahiawā District Court, and add a much-needed District Court Judge in Kona. These resources will significantly expand capacity to certain operations and restore funding for positions critical to operations.",
  "economic_impact": "The Women’s Court program's goal is to aid participants in bettering their economic conditions and life circumstances and prevent re-entry into criminality. The Driving While Impaired (DWI) Court Program seeks to reduce recidivism among repeat and high-risk offenders by addressing the underlying cause of impaired driving. Additionally, the Truancy Court and Early Education Intervention Program aims to address chronic school truancy, which supports long-term academic and economic success for students.",
  "policy_impact": "This bill makes permanent the Women’s Court Pilot Project, which was established by the Legislature in July of 2022 (Act 243/22) with funding for a three-year pilot. It also seeks permanent funding for the DWI Court Program, which was initially supported by federal funding. The measure expands judicial services by funding an additional District Court Judge in Kona to address an extraordinary caseload and continues the work of the Criminal Justice Research Institute (CJRI) established by Act 179 (SLH 2019).",
  "revenue_sources": "The capital improvement projects are to be funded by $11.9M (HB400) in bond funds. Operating resources are an addition of approximately 3% to the Judiciary’s operating budget, implying General Fund appropriations. Some programs, like the DWI Court, were initially supported by federal funding from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) but are now seeking permanent state funding.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "For the 2025-2027 biennium, the Judiciary requests additional operating resources of $6.17M (HB400) in FY 2026 and $6.25M (HB400) in FY 2027, supporting 17.0 permanent and 1.0 temporary FTE. Key recurring annual costs include the Women’s Court at $705,416 (HB400) in both FY 2026 and FY 2027, and the DWI Court Program at $232,412 (HB400) in FY 2026 and $237,612 (HB400) in FY 2027. Cybersecurity upgrades represent a significant recurring expense, with a request for $1,175,300 (HB400) in both FY 2026 and FY 2027 for email security, plus $458,224 (HB400) annually for cybersecurity staff and tools. Staffing for the new Wahiawā District Court totals over $940,000 annually, including requests for security, IT, janitorial, and clerical staff. A new Kona District Court Judge and support staff require $368,943 (HB400) in FY 2026 and $360,048 (HB400) in FY 2027. Funding for the Criminal Justice Research Institute is requested to continue at $512,624 (HB400) in FY 2026 and $577,058 (HB400) in FY 2027 for one position and software, with an additional temporary position costing $71,016 (HB400) each year. These costs are associated with permanent programs and positions, indicating they will become part of the Judiciary's base budget and are expected to continue beyond the biennium.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The provided documents do not describe any anticipated impacts on operating revenues resulting from this measure. The bill focuses on appropriations for the Judiciary's operational and capital improvement needs. There is no mention of new fees, fines, or other revenue-generating mechanisms.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The Judiciary requests CIP bond funds totaling $11.9 million (HB400) for FY 2026. This includes $4.0 million (HB400) to design a new South Kohala District Courthouse and $900,000 (HB400) to replace an A/C chiller on Kaua‘i. The Judiciary also requests $7.0 million (HB400) in lump sum bond funds, which includes $2.0 million (HB400) to address a shortfall in funding for the relocation of the Children’s Justice Center on Oʻahu.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "Ongoing fiscal obligations will primarily consist of the annualized costs for the 17.0 permanent FTE (HB400) and recurring expenses for programs made permanent by this bill. These costs, including salaries, benefits, and technology subscriptions, will be integrated into the Judiciary's base budget. The Judiciary will be responsible for the continued operation of expanded Specialty Courts and the fully staffed Wahiawā District Court.",
