  "overview": "House Bill 400, House Draft 1, appropriates funds for the Judiciary's operating and capital improvement project (CIP) budget for the 2025–2027 fiscal biennium. The measure aims to support essential court operations by funding permanent and temporary positions, making pilot programs permanent, and addressing critical infrastructure needs. Key components include funding for specialty courts, staffing for new facilities, additional judgeships, and significant cybersecurity upgrades.",
  "appropriations": "The Judiciary requests additional operating resources of $6.17M (HB400) in FY 2026 and $6.25M (HB400) in FY 2027, along with 17.0 permanent FTE and 1.0 temporary FTE (HB400). For capital improvements, the bill appropriates $11.9M (HB400) in bond funds for FY 2026. These funds are intended for staffing various courts, expanding specialty court programs, cybersecurity enhancements, and constructing and maintaining court facilities.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The financial projections are based on the Judiciary's detailed testimony outlining its resource requirements for the upcoming biennium. The methodology involves aggregating specific line-item requests for personnel, technology contracts, security services, and capital projects based on projected needs and current operational circumstances. Costs for staffing are based on position salaries and benefits, while technology and capital costs are based on vendor estimates and project assessments, such as the increased cost for the Children's Justice Center relocation.",
  "agency_impact": "This measure will significantly impact the Judiciary by expanding its capacity to serve the public and enhance security. It will allow for the permanent establishment of the Women's Court and DWI Court Program, the full staffing of the new Wahiawā District Court, and the addition of a much-needed District Court Judge in Kona to address high caseloads. Furthermore, the funding will improve the Judiciary's cybersecurity posture and replace end-of-life technology infrastructure, ensuring operational continuity.",
  "economic_impact": "The measure is expected to yield positive economic effects by funding programs aimed at reducing recidivism, such as the Women’s Court, which helps participants improve their economic conditions. The Early Education Intervention Program, supported by this bill, addresses truancy to foster long-term academic and career success. Additionally, funding for civil legal services, as requested in testimony (HB-400-HD-1 Submitted on: 3/18/2025 9:07:44 AM), helps prevent costly outcomes like eviction and homelessness for low-income individuals.",
  "policy_impact": "This bill modifies existing state policy by transitioning pilot projects, like the Women’s Court established by Act 243/22 (HB400), into permanent programs, thereby embedding them into the state's justice system. It expands the Judiciary's footprint and services in rural communities with the new Wahiawā District Court and addresses long-standing judicial shortages in high-growth areas like Kona. The measure reinforces the state's commitment to modernizing court operations through significant investments in technology and cybersecurity infrastructure.",
  "revenue_sources": "The operating budget requests, totaling $6.17M (HB400) in FY 2026 and $6.25M (HB400) in FY 2027, are expected to be funded from the state's general fund. The Capital Improvement Project requests, totaling $11.9M (HB400) for FY 2026, will be financed through the issuance of general obligation bonds. The provided documents do not specify any other revenue sources such as grants or fees to support these specific appropriations.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The six-year fiscal outlook includes significant recurring costs for the Judiciary's operating budget, with requested increases of $6.17M (HB400) in FY 2026 and $6.25M (HB400) in FY 2027. These costs are driven by the addition of 17.0 permanent FTE and 1.0 temporary FTE (HB400), with associated salary and benefits expected to continue annually. Key recurring program costs include the Women’s Court at $705,416 (HB400) annually, the DWI Court at $232,412 (HB400) in FY 2026 and $237,612 (HB400) in FY 2027, and the new Kona District Court Judge and staff at $368,943 (HB400) in FY 2026 and $360,048 (HB400) in FY 2027. Technology expenses will also be ongoing, with a major cybersecurity email upgrade costing $1,175,300 (HB400) per year and cybersecurity staff and tools costing $458,224 (HB400) annually. The Criminal Justice Research Institute requires continued funding of $583,640 (HB400) in FY 2026 and $648,074 (HB400) in FY 2027. On the capital side, the $11.9M (HB400) in bond funds for FY 2026 is a one-time expenditure, but the new facilities will introduce new, ongoing operating and maintenance costs in future years. These projections assume that the programs made permanent will continue operations without significant changes in scope. The recurring costs are expected to increase over time with inflation and salary adjustments.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "Based on the provided documents, this measure is not anticipated to have any direct impact on the Judiciary's operating revenues. The bill exclusively concerns appropriations for expenditures and does not introduce new fees, fines, or other revenue-generating mechanisms. Therefore, no significant increase, decrease, or change in revenue streams is expected as a result of this measure.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The measure requests a total of $11.9M (HB400) in bond funds for capital expenditures in FY 2026. This includes $4.0 million (HB400) for the design of a new South Kohala District Courthouse and $900,000 (HB400) to replace an A/C chiller at Pu‘uhonua Kaulike on Kaua‘i. The remaining $7.0 million (HB400) is requested as lump sum funds for statewide building issues, which includes $2.0 million (HB400) to address a funding shortfall for the relocation of the Children’s Justice Center on O‘ahu.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "After the initial six-year period, the fiscal obligations from this measure will be ongoing, primarily driven by recurring personnel and operational costs. The 17.0 permanent positions (HB400) will represent a sustained annual expense for salaries and benefits, adjusted for inflation. Programs made permanent, along with technology subscriptions like the M365 G5 email upgrade at $1,175,300 (HB400) annually, will require continuous funding from the general fund to maintain service levels.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "No previous fiscal note was provided in the context documents. Therefore, a comparison of updates cannot be made."
