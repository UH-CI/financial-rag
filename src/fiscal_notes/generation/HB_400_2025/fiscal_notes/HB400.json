  "overview": "House Bill 400, HD1, SD1 appropriates funds for the Judiciary's operating and capital improvement budgets for the fiscal biennium from July 1, 2025, to June 30, 2027. The bill includes funding for making pilot specialty courts permanent, staffing for new and existing courthouses, adding a new judgeship, and upgrading technology infrastructure. Key components also involve restoring positions that were defunded during the COVID-19 pandemic and supporting civil legal services.",
  "appropriations": "The Judiciary requests additional operating funds of $6.17 million and 18 FTEs for FY 2026, and $6.25 million for FY 2027, representing an approximate 3% increase to its operating budget. Additionally, the bill appropriates $11.9 million in bond funds for Capital Improvement Projects (CIP) in FY 2026. These funds are designated for staffing, technology upgrades like cybersecurity, making programs like the Women's Court permanent, and designing a new courthouse in South Kohala.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "Financial projections are based on current operational needs, projected caseload growth, and specific program requirements. Cost estimations for staffing are derived from established salary schedules, while technology costs are based on vendor quotes for cybersecurity subscriptions and end-of-life replacement schedules for hardware. Capital project costs, such as the South Kohala courthouse design and the Children's Justice Center relocation, are based on initial planning estimates and updated information on project shortfalls.",
  "agency_impact": "This measure will enable the Judiciary to address critical operational deficiencies, enhance public safety, and improve access to justice. The funding will alleviate unsustainable caseloads in Kona, properly staff the new Wahiawā District Court, make successful pilot programs permanent, and bolster cybersecurity defenses. These appropriations are crucial for the Judiciary to manage its expanding responsibilities and maintain the efficient administration of justice across the state.",
  "economic_impact": "Funding for specialty courts, such as the Women's Court and DWI Court, is expected to reduce recidivism, leading to long-term cost savings associated with incarceration. Support for the Early Elementary Intervention Program aims to decrease chronic absenteeism, which can improve long-term educational and economic outcomes for students. The appropriation for civil legal services helps low-income residents resolve housing, family, and consumer issues, promoting economic stability and preventing homelessness.",
  "policy_impact": "This bill transitions successful pilot programs, like the Women's Court established by Act 243/22, into permanent fixtures, solidifying their role in the state's justice system. It supports the expansion of judicial resources by funding an additional District Court Judge in Kona, modifying the court's structure to meet demographic changes. The measure also continues the development of the Criminal Justice Research Institute's statewide data system, which will inform future evidence-based policymaking in criminal justice.",
  "revenue_sources": "The primary revenue source for the operating budget requests is the state's general fund. Capital Improvement Projects, totaling $11.9 million, are to be funded through the issuance of general obligation bonds. While some programs like the DWI Court were initially supported by federal grants, this bill seeks to secure permanent state funding, shifting the revenue reliance to state-level appropriations.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "For the fiscal biennium 2025-2027, the bill appropriates an additional $6.17 million in FY26 and $6.25 million in FY27 for operations, along with 17 permanent and 1 temporary FTE. Capital expenditures include a one-time request of $11.9 million in bond funds for FY26. Beyond the biennium, these operational costs are expected to be recurring and will likely increase with inflation and collective bargaining adjustments. For example, the cybersecurity upgrade represents an ongoing annual cost of over $1.1 million, and the permanent staffing for the Women's Court, Kona judgeship, and Wahiawā court will become part of the Judiciary's base budget. The total increase in operating costs over six years is projected to be substantial as these new programs and positions are integrated permanently. For instance, the Women's Court requires approximately $705,000 annually, and the Kona judge and staff need around $360,000 annually. These, combined with other recurring expenses for restored positions and technology, will continue to impact the budget. The assumption is that these programs will operate indefinitely, requiring sustained funding in the out-years. The capital projects are primarily funded in FY26, but the new facilities will create ongoing operational and maintenance costs in subsequent years.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "This measure is not anticipated to have any direct impact on the Judiciary's operating revenues. The bill's focus is on securing appropriations from the state's general fund to cover expenses. No new fees, fines, or other revenue-generating mechanisms are proposed as part of this legislation.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The bill requests $11.9 million in bond funds for Capital Improvement Projects in FY 2026. This includes $4.0 million for the design of a new South Kohala District Courthouse to replace an inadequate and unsafe facility. Other capital expenditures include $900,000 to replace an A/C chiller at Pu‘uhonua Kaulike on Kaua‘i and a $7.0 million lump sum for various statewide projects, including an identified $2.0 million shortfall for the O'ahu Children's Justice Center relocation.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "Beyond the six-year period, the fiscal implications include permanent, ongoing operating costs for the 17 new positions and the continuation of newly established permanent programs like the Women's Court. Annual expenses for technology subscriptions, such as the $1.175 million for M365 G5 email security, will continue indefinitely. The new and renovated facilities will also require sustained funding for maintenance, utilities, and security, adding to the Judiciary's baseline operational budget in perpetuity.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "No previous fiscal note was provided in the source documents. Therefore, a comparison cannot be made."
