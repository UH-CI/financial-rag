  "overview": "House Bill 400 appropriates funds for the Judiciary's operating and capital improvement budgets for the fiscal biennium from July 1, 2025, to June 30, 2027. The bill provides resources for critical needs including additional staffing, the establishment of permanent specialty court programs, technology and cybersecurity upgrades, and new court facility development. Key components include funding for an additional judge in Kona, staffing for the new Wahiawā courthouse, and design funds for a new South Kohala courthouse.",
  "appropriations": "The bill appropriates additional operating funds of $6.17 million for FY 2026 and $6.25 million for FY 2027, supporting 17.0 new permanent full-time equivalent (FTE) positions and 1.0 temporary FTE. It also includes a request for $11.9 million in capital improvement project bond funds for FY 2026. These funds are designated for staffing, specialty courts, cybersecurity upgrades, contractual services, and the design and renovation of court facilities.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "Financial projections are based on projected resource needs, including staffing for the new Wahiawā District Court opening in 2026 and addressing severe caseload growth in Kona, which has been benchmarked against population increases since the last judicial position was added. Cost estimations for technology are based on vendor quotes for upgraded software subscriptions (M365 G5) and the expected end-of-life for network hardware. Capital project costs are based on preliminary estimates for facility design and known shortfalls for ongoing projects like the Children's Justice Center relocation.",
  "agency_impact": "This measure will significantly impact the Judiciary by expanding its operational capacity to address critical service gaps and infrastructure deficiencies. The addition of 18 staff positions, including a new judge, will require increased administrative and supervisory oversight to manage increased caseloads and new programs. The funding enables the Judiciary to make pilot programs like the Women's Court permanent, enhance cybersecurity, and begin the process of replacing inadequate court facilities, impacting nearly all of its departments.",
  "economic_impact": "The measure is expected to generate economic benefits by improving the efficiency of the justice system, reducing costly delays for litigants and businesses. Funding for the Early Elementary Intervention Program aims to reduce chronic absenteeism, potentially leading to long-term societal savings through improved educational outcomes. Additionally, the appropriation for civil legal services provides a critical safety net for low-income residents, helping to prevent homelessness and resolve consumer and family law issues that could otherwise create larger social costs.",
  "policy_impact": "This bill reinforces the state's commitment to access to justice by funding an additional judgeship and a new courthouse in response to significant population growth. It advances policy goals of therapeutic justice by making specialty courts, such as the Women's Court and DWI Court, permanent fixtures within the judicial system. The measure also supports the policy of modernizing government operations through significant investments in cybersecurity and information technology infrastructure.",
  "revenue_sources": "The primary revenue source for the requested operating budget increases is the state's general fund. Capital improvement projects, totaling $11.9 million, are requested to be funded through the issuance of general obligation bonds. The measure also transitions programs previously supported by federal grants, such as the DWI Court Program, to permanent state general fund support.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The six-year fiscal outlook includes recurring operating cost increases of approximately $6.17 million in FY 2026 and $6.25 million in FY 2027, with costs expected to continue at or above this level in subsequent years. These figures account for salaries and benefits for 18 new and continuing FTE positions across various circuits and programs. Major annual recurring expenses include over $705,000 for the permanent Women's Court, $487,000 for contracted security at the new Wahiawā court, and $1.175 million for an upgraded email and cybersecurity subscription. In FY 2026, there is a one-time capital expenditure request of $11.9 million in bond funds. The $4.0 million allocated for the design of the South Kohala District Courthouse implies a significant future capital request for construction will be needed in the next one to two biennia. Debt service on the $11.9 million in bonds will become a recurring general fund expense for the life of the bonds. The bill proposes making several temporary specialty court programs and positions permanent, establishing them as ongoing operational costs. This includes the Women's Court, DWI Court Program, and staff for the Criminal Justice Research Institute. The expansion of services at the new Wahiawā courthouse and the addition of a judge in Kona will create a new, higher baseline for the Judiciary's operating budget going forward. It is assumed these programs and staffing levels will be maintained, with costs increasing modestly with inflation and negotiated salary adjustments in the out-years.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "This appropriations bill focuses on expenditures and does not include any provisions to alter existing fees, fines, or other revenue streams for the Judiciary. Therefore, the measure is not anticipated to have any direct impact on the state's or the Judiciary's operating revenues. The purpose of the bill is to allocate funds, not to generate them.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The measure requests a total of $11.9 million in capital improvement project bond funds for FY 2026. This includes $4.0 million to fund the design phase for a new South Kohala District Courthouse to replace the current inadequate facility. It also allocates $900,000 to replace an aging air conditioning chiller at the Kaua‘i courthouse and $7.0 million in lump sum funds for various statewide projects, including covering an anticipated $2.0 million shortfall for the relocation of the Children’s Justice Center on Oʻahu.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "Beyond the six-year fiscal period, the state will incur ongoing annual operating costs of at least $6.25 million (in current dollars) to sustain the 17 permanent positions and associated programs established by this bill. A significant future capital expenditure for the construction of the new South Kohala District Courthouse is expected, as this bill only funds the design phase. The long-term fiscal sustainability will depend on continued general fund appropriations to support the expanded operational baseline of the Judiciary.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "A previous fiscal note was not provided. Therefore, this section is not applicable."
