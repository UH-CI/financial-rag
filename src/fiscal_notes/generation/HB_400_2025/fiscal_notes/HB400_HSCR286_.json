[2] Funding is also requested for cybersecurity, the Criminal Justice Research Institute (CJRI), and the restoration of essential staffing that was defunded during the COVID-19 pandemic. [2]",
  "appropriations": "The Judiciary requests additional operating resources of $6.17M in FY 2026 and $6.25M in FY 2027. [2] Specific requests include $705,416 (HB400_TESTIMONY_JHA_01-30-25_.PDF.txt) in FY 2026 and $705,416 (HB400_TESTIMONY_JHA_01-30-25_.PDF.txt) in FY 2027 to establish a permanent Women’s Court, and funding to make the Driving While Impaired (DWI) Court Program permanent at a cost of $232,412 (HB400_TESTIMONY_JHA_01-30-25_.PDF.txt) in FY 2026 and $237,612 (HB400_TESTIMONY_JHA_01-30-25_.PDF.txt) in FY 2027.

[3]",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The Judiciary's budget request is based on current circumstances and projected resource needs for the future. [2] The methodology includes calculating costs to make pilot programs permanent, such as the Women's Court, and to continue programs with expiring funding, like the Criminal Justice Research Institute. [2] [2] Cost estimations are also based on staffing new facilities like the Wahiawā District Court, addressing increased caseloads in Kona, and restoring funding for positions that were defunded during the pandemic to meet current operational needs. [2] [2]",
  "agency_impact": "The appropriations will allow the Judiciary to establish a permanent Women’s Court, also known as Mohala Wahine, with 8.0 FTE permanent positions.

[2] Additionally, third-party testimony requests an increase of $1,000,000 (HB400_TESTIMONY_JHA_01-30-25_.PDF.txt) for civil legal services, which serve low-income residents facing critical issues like eviction and family separation. [2] [2]",
  "policy_impact": "This measure transitions successful pilot programs, such as the Women’s Court Pilot Project, into permanent programs. [2] It also secures permanent funding for the DWI Court Program, which has been operational since 2013 with initial federal funding. [2] The bill reverses a pandemic-era policy by restoring funding for selected positions that were previously defunded to help the State's economic crisis. [2]",
