These organizations are requesting an additional $1,000,000 in funding through the Judiciary's budget to prevent costly outcomes like homelessness, domestic violence crises, and family separation. This funding is presented as a critical component of the state's social safety net, especially with anticipated reductions in federal funds.",

This request aims to expand the state's role in mitigating the 'justice gap' for indigent residents.",

This increase is specifically to cover costs for relocating the Children's Justice Center. Additionally, a new recurring cost has been proposed in testimony from civil legal service providers, who are requesting a $1,000,000 annual increase to the budget line-item for statewide civil legal services, which would represent a new, ongoing general fund obligation.",
