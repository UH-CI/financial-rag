  "overview": "",
  "appropriations": "In addition to the Judiciary's direct budget request, testimony from civil legal service providers including the Legal Aid Society of Hawai‘i and Volunteer Legal Services Hawai‘i requests an additional $1,000,000 be appropriated to the line item for statewide civil legal services. This requested increase is intended to address the 'justice gap' and a reduction in available federal funds for low-income residents. This funding would be in addition to the operating funds requested directly by the Judiciary.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "",
  "agency_impact": "",
  "economic_impact": "Testimony highlights that increased funding for civil legal services providers would enhance economic stability for vulnerable populations. For example, in 2024, one provider assisted approximately 1,000 individuals, of whom 21% were homeless or at risk of homelessness and 28% were domestic violence survivors. Addressing these civil legal needs can prevent costly outcomes such as eviction and unemployment, thereby reducing strain on other social safety net programs.",
  "policy_impact": "",
  "revenue_sources": "",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The fiscal outlook could be amended to include an additional recurring annual cost of $1,000,000 for statewide civil legal services, should the Legislature adopt the recommendation from testimony. This would increase the Judiciary's pass-through appropriations and establish a new, higher funding baseline for these services in subsequent years. This increase would supplement the Judiciary's own operating requests and would be sourced from the general fund.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The House Committee on Judiciary & Hawaiian Affairs, in its standing committee report, has recommended that the Committee on Finance consider increasing the Judiciary's requested lump sum bond funds from $5.0 million to $7.0 million. This $2.0 million increase is specifically to cover additional costs for the relocation of the Children's Justice Center. This amendment brings the total recommended capital expenditure to $11.9 million for FY 2026, which is higher than the Judiciary's initial $9.9 million request.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "If the requested $1,000,000 increase for civil legal services is approved, it would represent an ongoing annual general fund obligation. This would be in addition to the costs required to sustain the Judiciary's own programmatic and staffing expansions. The long-term sustainability of this increased support for legal aid would depend on future legislative appropriations.",
  "updates_from_previous_fiscal_note": "The primary updates in this fiscal note center on two key areas. First, it incorporates a significant funding request from testimony by multiple civil legal service providers for an additional $1,000,000 annually for the statewide civil legal services line item, a specific detail not included previously. Second, it clarifies the origin of the capital improvement project (CIP) funding amount, explaining that the increase from the Judiciary's initial $9.9 million request to the $11.9 million figure results from a specific recommendation by the House Committee on Judiciary & Hawaiian Affairs to add $2.0 million for the Children's Justice Center relocation."
