David A. Tarnas, Chair Rep. Mahina Poepoe, Vice-Chair Thursday January 30, 2025 at 2:00 p.m. The Legal Aid Society of Hawaii submits testimony in strong support of HB400–Relating to the Judiciary. In addition to supporting the Judiciary’s budget priorities, we support an additional $1,000,000 increase in the budget line-item for statewide civil legal services. HB400 contains a line-item for statewide civil legal services, which the Judiciary administers to the State’s qualifying legal services providers to provide “general civil legal services without charge to indigent residents of the State of Hawaiʻi.” This line-item is vital to meeting the needs of our residents statewide, and more funding is needed to attempt to meet the unmet critical legal needs of our communities. IMPACT OF HB400 With the support of this line-item, Legal Aid has been able to provide civil legal services to our low-income and vulnerable populations",

And, it is likely that we will see attempts to “zero out” funding for legal services, which happened four years in a row when this current administration was previously in office. There are now four legal service providers recieving this critical funding, and all of our low- income and vulnerable populations statewide and across demographics are positively impacted by this support. We respectfully request that you increase support for legal services by adding an additional $1,000,000 to the line item for legal services, which is an important part of the safety net of social services that Hawaiʻi’s residents need. The Judiciary has been a leader in supporting “access to justice” initiatives here in Hawaiʻi, and has generously provided a home for this line-item. Our ask is intended to supplement the Judiciary’s legislative priorities, and should not come at the expense of any priority or portion of the proposed budget.

The current South Kohala District Court carries significant concerns for safety, space, temperature, noise, and is quite simply inadequate to serve the community’s court-related needs.

The chiller is near the end of its lifecycle, and A/C manufacturing is experiencing hardships resulting in long lead times. The Judiciary also requests $7.0 million in lump sum bond funds to address both continuing and emerging building issues statewide.

The Legislature provided $6.0 million for that project in 2023. Since then, we have located a site and, along with DAGS, are proceeding.

Moriwaki, Vice Chair The Legal Aid Society of Hawaii submits testimony in strong support of HB400–Relating to the Judiciary. LASH supports the Judiciary’s overall budget priorities, as well as its continued administration of funding for statewide civil legal services. HB400 contains a line-item for statewide civil legal services, which the Judiciary graciously administers to the State’s qualifying legal services providers to provide “general civil legal services without charge to indigent residents of the State of Hawaiʻi.” We are asking to supplement this line-item with an additional $1 million to ensure that legal service providers have increased resources to meet the needs of the communities we serve. This ask is intended to supplement the Judiciary’s legislative priorities, and should not come at the expense of any priority or portion of their proposed budget. IMPACT OF HB400 With the support of this line-item, Legal Aid has been able to provide civil legal services to our low-income and vulnerable populations across our state. As the state’s largest and oldest legal service provider, we deliver legal services in the areas most needed by Hawaiʻi’s residents, including family law, housing, domestic abuse,",

Current resources are not meeting our community’s needs: the National Justice Index determined that nine times as many legal services attorneys and advocates are needed to meet Hawaiʻi low-income residents’ legal needs. There are now four legal service providers receiving this critical funding, and all of our low- income and vulnerable populations statewide and across demographics are positively impacted by this support. We respectfully request that you increase support for legal services by adding an additional $1,000,000 to the line item for legal services, which is an important part of the safety net of social services that Hawaiʻi’s residents need. We are sensitive to the fact that the State is facing significant fiscal pressures due to potential federal funding cuts. In addition, changes to the federal funding and policy landscape also require additional support for Hawaiʻi’s legal services providers. Recently, there have been dramatic reductions in available federal funds for victims of crime and domestic-violence survivors. Legal Aid receives substantial federal funds to provide services related to housing, assisting Hawaiʻi’s houseless communities, kūpuna legal services, health insurance",
