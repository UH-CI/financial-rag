10. HR129_: This House Resolution urges the Department of Law Enforcement, the City and County of Honolulu, and the Honolulu Police Department to collaborate with local businesses and organizations to establish programs for the disposal of illegal fireworks.

The Act is set to take effect on July 1, 2025.
14. HB895_: This bill, HB895, aims to strengthen the enforcement of fireworks laws across Hawaii's counties. It appropriates funds for the Honolulu, Hawaii, Maui, and Kauai police departments to hire additional personnel. Specifically, each department will receive funding for four full-time equivalent positions dedicated to enforcing fireworks regulations.

15. HB200_: This bill aims to reduce the risks and disruptions associated with consumer fireworks in Hawaii. It proposes to limit their use, allowing them only for cultural purposes via a permit. The current authorization for non-cultural use on New Year's Eve, Fourth of July, and Chinese New Year's Day will be discontinued.

Response: ## Analysis

The search bill, HB1483, seeks to enhance public safety by creating a new adjudication system for fireworks infractions, increasing penalties, and appropriating funds for implementation. The vast majority of the similar bills found support this overarching goal through various, often complementary, legislative strategies. Only one bill presents a contracting or competing approach. These bills can be thematically grouped based on their primary mechanism for addressing the illegal fireworks problem in Hawaii.

The most closely aligned bills are those that, like HB1483, propose a comprehensive overhaul of the enforcement and judicial process. **HB1005** and **SB1324** are nearly identical in scope to the search bill, proposing a new adjudication system for infractions, enhancing penalties, and appropriating funds. They represent a parallel legislative effort to achieve the same systemic reform.

A significant number of bills support HB1483's goal of "stricter penalties." This cluster includes **HB607**, which creates a Class A felony for causing injury or death; **HB83**, which escalates penalties for repeat offenders to Class A felonies; and **HB187** and **SB476**, which both focus on increasing fines. **HB806** also enhances penalties through a novel mechanism: pension forfeiture for felony convictions. These bills directly reinforce a key component of HB1483's strategy.

Another group focuses on bolstering enforcement and interdiction capabilities. **HB895** appropriates funds for additional police personnel dedicated to fireworks enforcement, while **HB806** funds sting operations. On the supply side, **SR207** urges the use of scanning equipment at ports and airports to stop illegal fireworks from entering the state. These measures provide the practical resources needed to make the adjudication and penalty systems proposed by HB1483 effective.

Several bills take a prohibition-focused approach, aiming to reduce the problem by narrowing the scope of what is legal. **SB611** and **HB633** propose broad revisions and bans on most types of fireworks, while **HB200** specifically targets consumer fireworks, limiting their use to permitted cultural events. These bills complement HB1483 by strengthening the underlying laws that its new adjudication system would enforce.

Finally, a set of bills and resolutions advocates for "softer" approaches centered on public awareness and safe disposal. **HB1305** proposes an education program in schools. **HCR135** and the nearly identical **HR129** urge the creation of disposal programs for residents to safely get rid of illegal fireworks. These initiatives support the overall cause by aiming to reduce demand and remove existing fireworks from communities, complementing the enforcement-heavy strategies of other bills.

In direct contrast to this trend, **SB1052** is a contracting bill. While its stated aim is to improve enforcement efficiency, its method is to *reduce* penalties for certain minor possession offenses by reclassifying them from misdemeanors to civil violations. This approach directly conflicts with the "stricter penalties" objective central to HB1483 and most other related legislation.

## Supporting Bills
*   **HB1005_**: This bill is highly supportive as it mirrors HB1483's core strategy by establishing a dedicated adjudication system, enhancing penalties, refining definitions, and appropriating funds for implementation.
*   **SB1324_**: This bill strongly supports the cause by creating a civil adjudication system, increasing penalties for offenses causing harm, and appropriating funds, closely aligning with the primary goals of HB1483.
*   **HB607_**: This bill supports the "stricter penalties" aspect of HB1483 by creating a specific Class A felony for causing serious bodily injury or death with fireworks.
*   **HB806_**: This bill supports the enforcement and penalty enhancement goals by funding police sting operations and introducing the severe penalty of pension forfeiture for felony fireworks offenses.
*   **SB611_**: This bill supports the overall goal of public safety by proposing a comprehensive revision of fireworks law that prohibits most types of fireworks, thereby strengthening the regulations that HB1483's system would enforce.
*   **HCR135_**: This resolution supports the cause by proposing a non-enforcement, public safety initiative to create programs for the safe disposal of illegal fireworks, complementing stricter enforcement measures.
*   **HB633_**: This supports the cause by creating a new "Fireworks Prohibition Law," which bans most fireworks and establishes significant penalties, aligning with the goal of a more robust enforcement mechanism.
*   **SR207_**: This resolution supports the cause by focusing on prevention and interdiction, requesting scanning technology at ports to stop the importation of illegal fireworks, which addresses the problem at its source.
*   **HR129_**: This resolution, like HCR135, supports the cause by urging the creation of safe disposal programs, aiming to reduce the quantity of illegal fireworks in the community through voluntary means.
*   **HB187_**: This bill directly supports HB1483's goal of stricter penalties by specifically increasing the fines for fireworks violations.
*   **SB476_**: Similar to HB187, this bill supports the call for stronger deterrents by raising the maximum fines for fireworks violations.
*   **HB83_**: This bill strongly supports the cause by significantly increasing penalties for fireworks violations, including escalating charges to Class A felonies for repeat offenses, and funding enforcement.
*   **HB895_**: This bill directly supports the enforcement aspect by appropriating funds to county police departments to hire more personnel specifically for enforcing fireworks laws.
*   **HB200_**: This bill supports the overall goal by restricting the use of consumer fireworks, thus reducing the number of potential violations and associated harms.
*   **HB1305_**: This bill supports the cause through a preventative, long-term strategy, mandating an education program in schools to raise awareness about fireworks dangers.

## Contracting/Competing Bills
*   **SB1052_**: This bill contracts the approach of HB1483 by proposing to *reduce* penalties for certain fireworks offenses, reclassifying them from misdemeanors to civil violations. This is in direct opposition to HB1483's aim of introducing stricter penalties.
