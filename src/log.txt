14. HB895_: This bill, HB895, aims to strengthen the enforcement of fireworks laws across Hawaii's counties. It appropriates funds for the Honolulu, Hawaii, Maui, and Kauai police departments to hire additional personnel. Specifically, each department will receive funding for four full-time equivalent positions dedicated to enforcing fireworks regulations.

Response: ## Analysis

The search bill, HB1483, seeks to enhance public safety by creating a new adjudication system for fireworks infractions, increasing penalties, and appropriating funds for implementation. The vast majority of the similar bills found support this overarching goal through various, often complementary, legislative strategies. Only one bill presents a contracting or competing approach. These bills can be thematically grouped based on their primary mechanism for addressing the illegal fireworks problem in Hawaii.

The most closely aligned bills are those that, like HB1483, propose a comprehensive overhaul of the enforcement and judicial process. **HB1005** and **SB1324** are nearly identical in scope to the search bill, proposing a new adjudication system for infractions, enhancing penalties, and appropriating funds. They represent a parallel legislative effort to achieve the same systemic reform.

A significant number of bills support HB1483's goal of "stricter penalties." This cluster includes **HB607**, which creates a Class A felony for causing injury or death; **HB83**, which escalates penalties for repeat offenders to Class A felonies; and **HB187** and **SB476**, which both focus on increasing fines. **HB806** also enhances penalties through a novel mechanism: pension forfeiture for felony convictions. These bills directly reinforce a key component of HB1483's strategy.

Another group focuses on bolstering enforcement and interdiction capabilities. **HB895** appropriates funds for additional police personnel dedicated to fireworks enforcement, while **HB806** funds sting operations. On the supply side, **SR207** urges the use of scanning equipment at ports and airports to stop illegal fireworks from entering the state. These measures provide the practical resources needed to make the adjudication and penalty systems proposed by HB1483 effective.

Several bills take a prohibition-focused approach, aiming to reduce the problem by narrowing the scope of what is legal. **SB611** and **HB633** propose broad revisions and bans on most types of fireworks, while **HB200** specifically targets consumer fireworks, limiting their use to permitted cultural events. These bills complement HB1483 by strengthening the underlying laws that its new adjudication system would enforce.

Finally, a set of bills and resolutions advocates for "softer" approaches centered on public awareness and safe disposal. **HB1305** proposes an education program in schools. **HCR135** and the nearly identical **HR129** urge the creation of disposal programs for residents to safely get rid of illegal fireworks. These initiatives support the overall cause by aiming to reduce demand and remove existing fireworks from communities, complementing the enforcement-heavy strategies of other bills.

In direct contrast to this trend, **SB1052** is a contracting bill. While its stated aim is to improve enforcement efficiency, its method is to *reduce* penalties for certain minor possession offenses by reclassifying them from misdemeanors to civil violations. This approach directly conflicts with the "stricter penalties" objective central to HB1483 and most other related legislation.

## Supporting Bills
*   **HB1005_**: This bill is highly supportive as it mirrors HB1483's core strategy by establishing a dedicated adjudication system, enhancing penalties, refining definitions, and appropriating funds for implementation.
*   **SB1324_**: This bill strongly supports the cause by creating a civil adjudication system, increasing penalties for offenses causing harm, and appropriating funds, closely aligning with the primary goals of HB1483.
*   **HB607_**: This bill supports the "stricter penalties" aspect of HB1483 by creating a specific Class A felony for causing serious bodily injury or death with fireworks.
*   **HB806_**: This bill supports the enforcement and penalty enhancement goals by funding police sting operations and introducing the severe penalty of pension forfeiture for felony fireworks offenses.
*   **SB611_**: This bill supports the overall goal of public safety by proposing a comprehensive revision of fireworks law that prohibits most types of fireworks, thereby strengthening the regulations that HB1483's system would enforce.
*   **HCR135_**: This resolution supports the cause by proposing a non-enforcement, public safety initiative to create programs for the safe disposal of illegal fireworks, complementing stricter enforcement measures.
*   **HB633_**: This supports the cause by creating a new "Fireworks Prohibition Law," which bans most fireworks and establishes significant penalties, aligning with the goal of a more robust enforcement mechanism.
*   **SR207_**: This resolution supports the cause by focusing on prevention and interdiction, requesting scanning technology at ports to stop the importation of illegal fireworks, which addresses the problem at its source.
*   **HR129_**: This resolution, like HCR135, supports the cause by urging the creation of safe disposal programs, aiming to reduce the quantity of illegal fireworks in the community through voluntary means.
*   **HB187_**: This bill directly supports HB1483's goal of stricter penalties by specifically increasing the fines for fireworks violations.
*   **SB476_**: Similar to HB187, this bill supports the call for stronger deterrents by raising the maximum fines for fireworks violations.
*   **HB83_**: This bill strongly supports the cause by significantly increasing penalties for fireworks violations, including escalating charges to Class A felonies for repeat offenses, and funding enforcement.
*   **HB895_**: This bill directly supports the enforcement aspect by appropriating funds to county police departments to hire more personnel specifically for enforcing fireworks laws.
*   **HB200_**: This bill supports the overall goal by restricting the use of consumer fireworks, thus reducing the number of potential violations and associated harms.
*   **HB1305_**: This bill supports the cause through a preventative, long-term strategy, mandating an education program in schools to raise awareness about fireworks dangers.

## Contracting/Competing Bills
*   **SB1052_**: This bill contracts the approach of HB1483 by proposing to *reduce* penalties for certain fireworks offenses, reclassifying them from misdemeanors to civil violations. This is in direct opposition to HB1483's aim of introducing stricter penalties.

Analyze the following similar bills found for HB727_:

**Search Bill:**
HB727_: This bill aims to address the increasing incarceration rates of women in Hawaii by establishing three-year women's court pilot programs in the second, third, and fifth circuits. Recognizing that women offenders often face unique challenges stemming from trauma, poverty, and caregiving responsibilities, these programs will focus on non-violent women at high risk of recidivism. Key provisions include implementing trauma-informed and gender-responsive practices, providing services like mental health treatment, substance abuse support, family support, and housing assistance. The judiciary will receive an appropriation for operational costs and temporary staff, and will report on the program's progress and provide recommendations for its future.

5. HB1079_: This bill, HB1079, aims to implement trauma-informed care within Hawaii's Department of Human Services child welfare services branch. Recognizing the significant trauma experienced by the families they serve, the legislature is directing the Office of Wellness and Resilience to collaborate with the Department of Human Services. Together, they will design and administer a program that includes trauma-informed organizational assessments and a comprehensive training curriculum for staff. This curriculum will address vicarious trauma and burnout among staff, incorporate evidence-based assessment tools, and establish ongoing support and specialized supervisor training. The bill appropriates $425,000 for each of fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027 to fund these initiatives, with the Act taking effect on July 1, 2025.
6. HB648_: This bill establishes a two-year pilot program within the First Circuit's Probate and Family Courts to address accessibility issues in guardianship and conservatorship proceedings. The program aims to ensure that respondents who cannot afford them have access to crucial court-ordered resources like "kokua kanawai," guardians ad litem, and professional evaluations. These resources provide essential independent assessments to support informed judicial decisions regarding a respondent's capacity and circumstances. The Judiciary is mandated to report on the program's progress and provide recommendations for its future.

The bill also allows for contracting with external entities and allocates $425,000 for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027 to support these initiatives. This legislative effort seeks to prevent retraumatization of children and families within the system.
8. SB189_: This bill, SB189, aims to reduce breast cancer incidence and deaths by mandating insurance coverage for early breast cancer screenings. It expands existing coverage to include annual mammograms for women with an above-average risk, a formal risk factor screening assessment for women aged 30 and older, and medically necessary supplemental imaging like MRIs and ultrasounds for any age group. The legislation builds on a previous auditor's assessment and clarifies definitions for "digital breast tomosynthesis" and "low-dose mammography." These expanded screenings will take effect for policies issued on or before January 1, 2026.
9. SB788_: Senate Bill 788 establishes a two-year pilot program within the Judiciary's first circuit probate and family courts to address accessibility issues with essential guardianship and conservatorship resources. The program aims to ensure that individuals who cannot afford these services, such as kokua kanawai, guardians ad litem, and professional evaluations, can still receive them when deemed beneficial by the court. This initiative is a response to findings from a legislative working group that identified financial barriers as a significant impediment to equitable outcomes for respondents. The Judiciary will submit reports on the program's progress and provide recommendations for its future. The bill appropriates $200,000 total over two fiscal years to fund this pilot program.
10. HB593_: This bill establishes a pilot program within the Department of Health to provide intensive mobile mental health services to chronically houseless adults with serious brain disorders, prioritizing those with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder.

The pilot program is funded with $1.3 million for two fiscal years and is set to conclude on June 30, 2028, with mandatory reports to the legislature on its progress.
11. HB1376_: This bill aims to phase out Hawaii's use of private, out-of-state correctional facilities. The legislature finds that these facilities, particularly for-profit ones, have negatively impacted inmates and their families, especially Native Hawaiians, by causing isolation and hindering successful reentry into society. To address this, the bill prohibits the state from housing inmates in private correctional institutions beginning July 1, 2030, while retaining authority for public facilities. Furthermore, it mandates that the Hawaii Correctional System Oversight Commission must approve any new correctional facility construction or expansion. This ensures greater oversight and community involvement in the state's correctional infrastructure planning as the use of private prisons diminishes.
12. HB127_: This bill aims to reform Hawaii's pretrial release system, acknowledging that cash bail disproportionately harms low-income individuals and people of color. It requires courts to record written justifications for imposing release conditions and mandates that bail amounts be affordable based on a defendant's financial situation. Key provisions include excluding public benefits and income below the federal poverty level when assessing a defendant's ability to pay bail. The legislation also presumes inability to pay for those with no income other than public benefits or who are in households below 150% of the federal poverty level. These changes are intended to reduce pretrial incarceration, address jail overcrowding, and lower state expenses, taking effect on July 1, 2025.
13. HB1263_: This bill establishes a legislative moratorium from July 1, 2025, to June 30, 2028, halting the planning and construction of new or expanded correctional facilities in Hawaii, particularly the replacement of the Oahu Community Correctional Center. The moratorium prohibits public-private partnerships for such projects due to concerns about transparency and public participation. Concurrently, the bill creates and funds a criminal justice diversion task force, mandated to recommend policies for reducing jail populations, addressing systemic issues like homelessness and substance use, and promoting alternatives to incarceration. This task force will focus on data-driven strategies and culturally informed approaches to reform Hawaii's correctional system.
14. SB734_: This bill aims to address Hawaii's shortage of social workers by creating a social work training program for nonviolent incarcerated individuals. The Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, in collaboration with the Department of Human Services, will develop and establish this program. This initiative will allow eligible incarcerated individuals to explore a career in social work and become assistants to licensed social workers. The bill also mandates progress reports to the legislature and appropriates funds for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027 to implement the program, which will take effect on July 1, 2025.
15. HB1197_: This bill aims to reform Hawaii's prison system by expanding mental health care services for inmates. It authorizes the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to prioritize student education partnerships to increase the number of clinical psychologists and mental health providers in correctional facilities. The bill also provides additional long-term funding for the department to expand its clinical psychology training programs. This initiative is driven by findings of severe overcrowding and the need for specialized mental health care for incarcerated individuals. The legislature believes these partnerships can lead to necessary prison reform and improve the delivery of mental health services.
16. SB1612_: This bill establishes a five-year fitness to proceed pilot program, managed by the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation in conjunction with the Department of Health. The program aims to alleviate overcrowding at the Hawaii State Hospital and enhance staff safety by providing dedicated space for incapacitated inmates or those awaiting a fitness to proceed determination. The program requires reserving one cell for every two eligible inmates, with joint responsibility shared between the departments until the inmate is no longer incapacitated or their fitness is determined. The Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation is mandated to submit both an interim report in 2027 and a final report with recommendations by 2030. The bill also appropriates funds for the program's implementation across fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027.
17. SB1399_: This bill establishes a five-year Family Resilience Pilot Program within Hawaii's Office of Wellness and Resilience, funded by approximately $987,150 per fiscal year for FY2025-2026 and FY2026-2027. The program aims to increase family resilience and reduce child abuse and neglect by providing trauma-informed peer support navigators with lived experience. These navigators will assist families with public benefits enrollment and connect them to family strengthening and cultural programming. Additionally, the program will offer financial and resource support for essential needs like food, housing, and transportation. The Office of Wellness and Resilience must establish a data tracking system and an evaluation plan by December 31, 2025, with the program set to expire on June 30, 2030.
18. HB1002_: This bill aims to strengthen the oversight of Hawaii's correctional system. It primarily seeks to extend the term of the oversight coordinator for the Hawaii Correctional System Oversight Commission from two to four years. Additionally, the bill clarifies the oversight coordinator's authority to inspect agencies and correctional facilities without prior notice. This enhanced authority allows for more thorough investigations and a better commitment to the system's transition towards a rehabilitative and therapeutic model. The proposed changes are set to take effect on July 1, 2025.
19. SB173_: This bill establishes a three-year pilot program within the Hawaii Judiciary to offer free child care services. The program aims to assist minor children of parties and witnesses attending court hearings in the first circuit, though it will only be available in a designated area. The Judiciary is required to report on the program's findings and recommendations to the Legislature annually. A total of $800,000 is appropriated for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027 to fund the establishment and operation of this child care initiative. The act is set to take effect on July 1, 2025.

Response: ## Analysis

The search bill, HB727_, which establishes women's court pilot programs, is part of a significant and multifaceted legislative effort to reform Hawaii's criminal justice system. The central themes connecting HB727_ to the similar bills are a shift towards therapeutic and rehabilitative justice, the implementation of trauma-informed care, and the creation of robust alternatives to incarceration for vulnerable populations.

The most closely related bill is its Senate companion, SB526_, which is nearly identical in its aim to establish a women's court pilot program. Beyond this direct parallel, a large cluster of bills supports HB727_'s goals by addressing the root causes that often lead to female incarceration. Bills like SB1628_ and HB943_ (establishing homeless triage centers) and HB593_ (creating a mobile mental health team) aim to provide community-based care for individuals with substance abuse, mental health, and housing crises—issues that are deeply intertwined with the challenges faced by the women HB727_ seeks to serve. Similarly, bills focusing on family resilience and trauma-informed child welfare (HB1383_, SB1399_, HB1079_, SB950_) target the familial and systemic trauma that contributes to the cycle of incarceration.

Another significant group of bills supports HB727_ by seeking broader systemic reform of the carceral state. These include measures for pretrial bail reform (HB127_), a moratorium on new jail construction to force a focus on diversion (HB1263_), phasing out private prisons (HB1376_), and expanding in-prison mental health and rehabilitation programs (HB1197_, SB734_). These bills collectively create a policy environment that favors the diversionary and rehabilitative approach embodied by the women's court pilot program.

There are no contracting or competing bills in this set. All the related bills are complementary, aiming to either provide parallel services, reform the broader system in a compatible way, or implement the same core methodologies (like trauma-informed care) in adjacent government functions.

Finally, a few bills are unrelated despite sharing superficial keywords like "judiciary," "pilot program," or "women." Bills concerning guardianship proceedings (HB648_, SB788_), court-provided childcare (SB173_), and insurance coverage for breast cancer screenings (SB189_) address separate issues within civil court access, court administration, and general healthcare, respectively, and do not intersect with the criminal justice reform goals of HB727_.

## Supporting Bills
*   **SB526_**: This is a companion bill to HB727_, proposing the same three-year women's court pilot program in the second, third, and fifth circuits to address the rising incarceration of women through trauma-informed and gender-responsive services.
*   **SB1628_**: This bill supports the cause by creating a homeless triage and treatment center, providing an alternative pathway and essential services for individuals with substance abuse and mental health issues who might otherwise end up in the criminal justice system.
*   **HB943_**: As a companion to SB1628_, this bill also establishes a homeless triage and treatment center, supporting HB727_'s goal of diversion by addressing root causes of criminal justice involvement like homelessness and untreated illness.
*   **HB1383_**: This bill creates a Family Resilience Pilot Program using trauma-informed support, which aligns with HB727_'s focus on addressing the family and caregiving challenges that are major factors in women's incarceration.
*   **HB1079_**: This bill supports the core methodology of HB727_ by implementing trauma-informed care within child welfare services, indicating a broader systemic shift towards the therapeutic approach used in the women's court.
*   **SB950_**: As a companion to HB1079_, this bill also promotes a trauma-informed child welfare system, reinforcing the principles of care and rehabilitation that underpin the women's court program.
*   **HB593_**: This bill establishes mobile mental health services for the chronically houseless, providing a critical community-based alternative to incarceration that supports the diversion goals of HB727_.
*   **HB1376_**: This bill supports systemic reform by phasing out private, out-of-state prisons, which aligns with the goal of creating a more humane and rehabilitative correctional system that prioritizes family connection, a key aspect of women's successful reentry.
*   **HB127_**: This bill aims to reform the pretrial bail system to make it more equitable. This directly supports the goal of reducing incarceration rates, particularly for low-income individuals, which includes the population HB727_ targets.
*   **HB1263_**: This bill directly supports alternatives to incarceration by placing a moratorium on new jail construction and creating a task force to develop diversion policies, creating a strong policy foundation for programs like the women's court.
*   **SB734_**: This bill supports the rehabilitative goals of HB727_ by creating a social work training program for nonviolent incarcerated individuals, providing a pathway for successful reentry and reducing recidivism.
*   **HB1197_**: This bill complements HB727_ by seeking to expand mental health care services within correctional facilities, addressing the same critical needs of the incarcerated population from a different angle.
*   **SB1612_**: This bill supports the overall goal of providing appropriate care for mentally ill individuals in the justice system by creating a pilot program for inmates awaiting fitness-to-proceed determinations, reducing strain on the carceral system.
*   **SB1399_**: As a companion bill to HB1383_, it establishes a Family Resilience Pilot Program, providing trauma-informed support to at-risk families, which helps prevent the circumstances that lead to women's incarceration.
*   **HB1002_**: This bill supports the move towards a more rehabilitative correctional system by strengthening the authority and term of the correctional system oversight coordinator, promoting accountability and reform.

## Contracting/Competing Bills
There are no contracting or competing bills in the provided list. All related bills are either complementary or address different facets of social and criminal justice reform.

## Unrelated Bills
*   **HB648_**: This bill is unrelated as it establishes a pilot program for guardianship and conservatorship proceedings within civil family courts, which does not pertain to criminal justice or incarceration.
*   **SB189_**: This bill is unrelated because it focuses on mandating insurance coverage for breast cancer screenings. While it is a women's health issue, it has no connection to the criminal justice system.
*   **SB788_**: As the companion to HB648_, this bill is also unrelated. It focuses on providing resources in civil guardianship and conservatorship cases, a separate area of law from criminal justice.
*   **SB173_**: This bill is unrelated because it creates a pilot program for free child care for individuals attending court hearings. This is a general access-to-justice initiative, not a criminal justice diversion or rehabilitation program.

Analyze the following similar bills found for HB727_:

**Search Bill:**
HB727_: This bill aims to address the increasing incarceration rates of women in Hawaii by establishing three-year women's court pilot programs in the second, third, and fifth circuits. Recognizing that women offenders often face unique challenges stemming from trauma, poverty, and caregiving responsibilities, these programs will focus on non-violent women at high risk of recidivism. Key provisions include implementing trauma-informed and gender-responsive practices, providing services like mental health treatment, substance abuse support, family support, and housing assistance. The judiciary will receive an appropriation for operational costs and temporary staff, and will report on the program's progress and provide recommendations for its future.

**Similar Bills:**
1. SB526_: This bill, SB526, aims to address the disproportionate increase of women in Hawaii's correctional facilities by establishing a three-year women's court pilot program. Building on a successful pilot in the first circuit, this Act will expand the program to the second, third, and fifth circuits. The program will utilize trauma-informed and gender-responsive practices to offer a range of services, including mental health treatment, family support, life-skills training, and substance abuse services.

The goal is to bridge a significant gap in behavioral health care for vulnerable populations, enabling quicker access to treatment and resources.
4. HB1383_: This bill establishes a five-year Family Resilience Pilot Program within Hawaii's Office of Wellness and Resilience. The program aims to address unmet needs of families at risk of child welfare system involvement by providing trauma-informed peer support navigators, financial assistance for basic needs, and a parenting intervention program. This initiative is based on recommendations from the Malama Ohana Working Group and successful diversion programs in other states. The bill appropriates $1,468,500 for each of fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027 to establish and implement this pilot program.

5. HB1079_: This bill, HB1079, aims to implement trauma-informed care within Hawaii's Department of Human Services child welfare services branch. Recognizing the significant trauma experienced by the families they serve, the legislature is directing the Office of Wellness and Resilience to collaborate with the Department of Human Services. Together, they will design and administer a program that includes trauma-informed organizational assessments and a comprehensive training curriculum for staff. This curriculum will address vicarious trauma and burnout among staff, incorporate evidence-based assessment tools, and establish ongoing support and specialized supervisor training. The bill appropriates $425,000 for each of fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027 to fund these initiatives, with the Act taking effect on July 1, 2025.
6. HB648_: This bill establishes a two-year pilot program within the First Circuit's Probate and Family Courts to address accessibility issues in guardianship and conservatorship proceedings. The program aims to ensure that respondents who cannot afford them have access to crucial court-ordered resources like "kokua kanawai," guardians ad litem, and professional evaluations. These resources provide essential independent assessments to support informed judicial decisions regarding a respondent's capacity and circumstances. The Judiciary is mandated to report on the program's progress and provide recommendations for its future. A total of $200,000 is appropriated for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027 to fund this initiative.
7. SB950_: This bill aims to foster a trauma-informed child welfare system in Hawaii by appropriating funds to the Office of Wellness and Resilience. The office will be responsible for designing and implementing trauma-informed organizational assessments and a comprehensive training curriculum for the Department of Human Services' child welfare services branch. Key provisions include assessing policies for trauma-informed practices, measuring worker well-being, and establishing a trained mentor cohort and specialized supervisor training. The bill also allows for contracting with external entities and allocates $425,000 for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027 to support these initiatives. This legislative effort seeks to prevent retraumatization of children and families within the system.
8. SB189_: This bill, SB189, aims to reduce breast cancer incidence and deaths by mandating insurance coverage for early breast cancer screenings. It expands existing coverage to include annual mammograms for women with an above-average risk, a formal risk factor screening assessment for women aged 30 and older, and medically necessary supplemental imaging like MRIs and ultrasounds for any age group. The legislation builds on a previous auditor's assessment and clarifies definitions for "digital breast tomosynthesis" and "low-dose mammography." These expanded screenings will take effect for policies issued on or before January 1, 2026.
9. SB788_: Senate Bill 788 establishes a two-year pilot program within the Judiciary's first circuit probate and family courts to address accessibility issues with essential guardianship and conservatorship resources. The program aims to ensure that individuals who cannot afford these services, such as kokua kanawai, guardians ad litem, and professional evaluations, can still receive them when deemed beneficial by the court. This initiative is a response to findings from a legislative working group that identified financial barriers as a significant impediment to equitable outcomes for respondents. The Judiciary will submit reports on the program's progress and provide recommendations for its future. The bill appropriates $200,000 total over two fiscal years to fund this pilot program.
10. HB593_: This bill establishes a pilot program within the Department of Health to provide intensive mobile mental health services to chronically houseless adults with serious brain disorders, prioritizing those with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. The program will operate one mobile team, managing up to forty participants, and offer crisis response, hospital liaison, and housing placement assistance. It also includes provisions for psychiatric medication initiation, assisted community treatment orders, and collaboration with various agencies. The pilot program is funded with $1.3 million for two fiscal years and is set to conclude on June 30, 2028, with mandatory reports to the legislature on its progress.
11. HB1376_: This bill aims to phase out Hawaii's use of private, out-of-state correctional facilities. The legislature finds that these facilities, particularly for-profit ones, have negatively impacted inmates and their families, especially Native Hawaiians, by causing isolation and hindering successful reentry into society. To address this, the bill prohibits the state from housing inmates in private correctional institutions beginning July 1, 2030, while retaining authority for public facilities. Furthermore, it mandates that the Hawaii Correctional System Oversight Commission must approve any new correctional facility construction or expansion. This ensures greater oversight and community involvement in the state's correctional infrastructure planning as the use of private prisons diminishes.
12. HB127_: This bill aims to reform Hawaii's pretrial release system, acknowledging that cash bail disproportionately harms low-income individuals and people of color. It requires courts to record written justifications for imposing release conditions and mandates that bail amounts be affordable based on a defendant's financial situation. Key provisions include excluding public benefits and income below the federal poverty level when assessing a defendant's ability to pay bail. The legislation also presumes inability to pay for those with no income other than public benefits or who are in households below 150% of the federal poverty level. These changes are intended to reduce pretrial incarceration, address jail overcrowding, and lower state expenses, taking effect on July 1, 2025.
13. HB1263_: This bill establishes a legislative moratorium from July 1, 2025, to June 30, 2028, halting the planning and construction of new or expanded correctional facilities in Hawaii, particularly the replacement of the Oahu Community Correctional Center. The moratorium prohibits public-private partnerships for such projects due to concerns about transparency and public participation. Concurrently, the bill creates and funds a criminal justice diversion task force, mandated to recommend policies for reducing jail populations, addressing systemic issues like homelessness and substance use, and promoting alternatives to incarceration. This task force will focus on data-driven strategies and culturally informed approaches to reform Hawaii's correctional system.
14. SB734_: This bill aims to address Hawaii's shortage of social workers by creating a social work training program for nonviolent incarcerated individuals. The Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, in collaboration with the Department of Human Services, will develop and establish this program. This initiative will allow eligible incarcerated individuals to explore a career in social work and become assistants to licensed social workers. The bill also mandates progress reports to the legislature and appropriates funds for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027 to implement the program, which will take effect on July 1, 2025.
15. HB1197_: This bill aims to reform Hawaii's prison system by expanding mental health care services for inmates. It authorizes the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to prioritize student education partnerships to increase the number of clinical psychologists and mental health providers in correctional facilities. The bill also provides additional long-term funding for the department to expand its clinical psychology training programs. This initiative is driven by findings of severe overcrowding and the need for specialized mental health care for incarcerated individuals. The legislature believes these partnerships can lead to necessary prison reform and improve the delivery of mental health services.
16. SB1612_: This bill establishes a five-year fitness to proceed pilot program, managed by the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation in conjunction with the Department of Health. The program aims to alleviate overcrowding at the Hawaii State Hospital and enhance staff safety by providing dedicated space for incapacitated inmates or those awaiting a fitness to proceed determination. The program requires reserving one cell for every two eligible inmates, with joint responsibility shared between the departments until the inmate is no longer incapacitated or their fitness is determined. The Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation is mandated to submit both an interim report in 2027 and a final report with recommendations by 2030. The bill also appropriates funds for the program's implementation across fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027.
17. SB1399_: This bill establishes a five-year Family Resilience Pilot Program within Hawaii's Office of Wellness and Resilience, funded by approximately $987,150 per fiscal year for FY2025-2026 and FY2026-2027. The program aims to increase family resilience and reduce child abuse and neglect by providing trauma-informed peer support navigators with lived experience. These navigators will assist families with public benefits enrollment and connect them to family strengthening and cultural programming. Additionally, the program will offer financial and resource support for essential needs like food, housing, and transportation. The Office of Wellness and Resilience must establish a data tracking system and an evaluation plan by December 31, 2025, with the program set to expire on June 30, 2030.
18. HB1002_: This bill aims to strengthen the oversight of Hawaii's correctional system. It primarily seeks to extend the term of the oversight coordinator for the Hawaii Correctional System Oversight Commission from two to four years. Additionally, the bill clarifies the oversight coordinator's authority to inspect agencies and correctional facilities without prior notice. This enhanced authority allows for more thorough investigations and a better commitment to the system's transition towards a rehabilitative and therapeutic model. The proposed changes are set to take effect on July 1, 2025.
19. SB173_: This bill establishes a three-year pilot program within the Hawaii Judiciary to offer free child care services. The program aims to assist minor children of parties and witnesses attending court hearings in the first circuit, though it will only be available in a designated area. The Judiciary is required to report on the program's findings and recommendations to the Legislature annually. A total of $800,000 is appropriated for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027 to fund the establishment and operation of this child care initiative. The act is set to take effect on July 1, 2025.

The search bill, HB727, proposes the creation of women-specific, trauma-informed court pilot programs to divert non-violent female offenders from incarceration and reduce recidivism. The provided similar bills can be analyzed in relation to this core mission, revealing a broad legislative trend toward systemic reform, addressing root causes of crime, and implementing rehabilitative, trauma-informed practices across various state systems. The bills fall into three main categories: those that directly support HB727's goals, those that are unrelated, and a notable absence of any bills that contract or compete with its purpose.

The majority of the bills are supportive, reinforcing the objectives of HB727 through various interconnected strategies. The most direct support comes from **SB526_**, which is a companion bill that is nearly identical to HB727, demonstrating bicameral support for establishing women's court pilot programs.

A significant group of supporting bills focuses on addressing the underlying societal issues that often lead to incarceration, which aligns with HB727's goal of providing wrap-around services for poverty, trauma, and caregiving responsibilities. Bills like **SB1628_**, **HB943_**, and **HB593_** establish programs to provide treatment and triage services for individuals experiencing homelessness and serious mental illness, populations that heavily overlap with the justice system. Similarly, **HB1383_** and **SB1399_** create Family Resilience pilot programs to support at-risk families, a preventative measure that directly addresses the family-related challenges faced by many women offenders. This approach is further reinforced by **SB173_**, which provides childcare in courthouses, directly mitigating one of the key barriers for women identified in HB727.

Several bills share HB727’s core methodology of trauma-informed care. **HB1079_** and **SB950_** aim to implement these practices within the child welfare system, signaling a broader state-level commitment to this evidence-based approach for vulnerable populations.

Another cluster of bills supports HB727 by enacting large-scale criminal justice reforms that create an environment conducive to diversion and rehabilitation. **HB127_** (bail reform), **HB1376_** (phasing out private prisons), and **HB1263_** (moratorium on new jail construction) all seek to reduce the state's reliance on incarceration. These "front-end" and systemic reforms make diversion programs like the women's court both more necessary and more feasible. Bills focused on improving conditions and programming for those who remain incarcerated, such as **HB1197_** (expanding mental health care) and **SB734_** (social work training), complement HB727 by promoting a continuum of care and rehabilitation. Finally, **HB1002_** strengthens correctional system oversight, ensuring accountability for the system's transition to a more therapeutic model.

No bills in the provided list are contracting or competing. This indicates a strong legislative consensus around moving away from purely punitive measures and towards solutions focused on rehabilitation, diversion, and addressing the root causes of criminal behavior.

A smaller set of bills are classified as unrelated. While some of these, like **HB648_** and **SB788_**, also establish pilot programs within the Judiciary, their focus on civil matters (guardianship and conservatorship) separates them from the criminal justice reform theme of HB727. **SB1612_** deals with the logistical management of inmates needing competency evaluations, an administrative issue within the carceral system rather than a rehabilitative reform. Lastly, **SB189_**, which mandates insurance coverage for breast cancer screening, is a women's health issue but is entirely outside the scope of the criminal justice system.

## Supporting Bills
*   **SB526_**: This is a companion bill, nearly identical to HB727. It also establishes a three-year women's court pilot program in the second, third, and fifth circuits, utilizing trauma-informed and gender-responsive practices to divert non-violent women offenders.
*   **SB1628_**: This bill supports the cause by addressing root drivers of incarceration, such as homelessness and substance abuse, through a trauma-informed treatment center program. This provides an alternative pathway and necessary services for the same vulnerable population HB727 aims to help.
*   **HB943_**: As a companion to SB1628, this bill also supports HB727's goals by establishing a homeless triage and treatment center. It aims to provide critical services to vulnerable individuals, thereby reducing their likelihood of entering or re-entering the criminal justice system.
*   **HB1383_**: This bill supports HB727's focus on women's unique challenges by establishing a Family Resilience Pilot Program. It addresses family instability and provides trauma-informed support, which can prevent women with caregiving responsibilities from entering the justice system.
*   **HB1079_**: This bill promotes the same core methodology as HB727 by implementing trauma-informed care within the child welfare system. It reinforces a systemic shift toward practices that are central to the women's court program.
*   **SB950_**: As a companion to HB1079, this bill also supports the underlying principles of HB727 by appropriating funds to design and implement trauma-informed care training and assessments within the child welfare system.
*   **HB593_**: This bill provides intensive mobile mental health services for chronically houseless adults, offering a community-based alternative to incarceration that aligns with the diversionary goals of HB727.
*   **HB1376_**: This bill supports the overall goal of a more rehabilitative justice system by phasing out private, out-of-state prisons, which will help keep incarcerated individuals, including women, closer to their families and support networks essential for reentry.
*   **HB127_**: This bill supports HB727 by reforming the bail system to reduce pretrial incarceration based on inability to pay. This "front-end" reform complements the "back-end" diversion model of the women's court by working to keep low-risk individuals out of jail.
*   **HB1263_**: This bill strongly supports the cause by halting new prison construction and creating a task force to find alternatives to incarceration. It champions the same philosophy as HB727: reducing the incarcerated population through policy changes and community-based solutions.
*   **SB734_**: This bill aligns with the rehabilitative spirit of HB727 by creating a social work training program for incarcerated individuals, providing them with skills and a pathway to successful reentry.
*   **HB1197_**: This bill is complementary, aiming to expand mental health care services within correctional facilities. While HB727 diverts women to receive these services, this bill ensures those already incarcerated also receive critical care, supporting the overall goal of rehabilitation.
*   **SB1399_**: As a companion to HB1383, this bill also supports HB727's intent by establishing a Family Resilience Pilot Program that uses trauma-informed peer navigators to assist at-risk families, a key preventative strategy.
*   **HB1002_**: This bill supports the systemic change needed for programs like HB727's to succeed by strengthening the oversight and accountability of the correctional system, pushing it towards a more rehabilitative model.
*   **SB173_**: This bill offers direct support by establishing a pilot program for free childcare in courthouses. This addresses the specific challenge of "caregiving responsibilities" mentioned in HB727, making it easier for women to navigate the justice system.

## Contracting/Competing Bills
There are no contracting or competing bills in the provided list. All relevant legislation appears to align with the goal of rehabilitation and reducing incarceration rates through diversion and trauma-informed care.

## Unrelated Bills
*   **HB648_**: This bill is unrelated because it focuses on a different area of the law. It establishes a pilot program in Probate and Family Courts to provide resources for guardianship and conservatorship proceedings, which are civil matters, not criminal.
*   **SB189_**: This bill is unrelated as it operates in the healthcare and insurance domain. It mandates insurance coverage for breast cancer screenings and, while focused on women, has no connection to the criminal justice system.
*   **SB788_**: As a companion to HB648, this bill is also unrelated. It addresses financial accessibility in civil guardianship and conservatorship cases, which is distinct from the criminal court diversion program in HB727.
*   **SB1612_**: This bill is unrelated because it addresses a specific logistical and administrative issue within the correctional system—the housing and management of inmates awaiting fitness to proceed determinations—rather than a broad policy of diversion or rehabilitation.

This initiative aims to reduce the amount of illegal fireworks in communities and enhance public safety.
11. HB187_: This bill, HB187, aims to increase fines for illegal fireworks violations in Hawaii to serve as a stronger deterrent against their use. The legislature believes current penalties are insufficient, referencing a 2011 task force report suggesting higher fines would be more effective. Specifically, the bill amends Section 132D-14 of the Hawaii Revised Statutes to raise the maximum fine for most fireworks violations and revises the penalty structure for violations of Section 132D-14.5. These changes are intended to address the ongoing disruption caused by aerial fireworks and will take effect on July 1, 2025. The Act preserves existing rights and penalties accrued before its effective date.
12. SB476_: This bill, SB476, aims to deter the use of illegal fireworks by increasing associated fines. The legislature finds that current penalties are insufficient and a stronger deterrent is needed.

13. HB83_: This bill, HB83, aims to enhance penalties for illegal fireworks in Hawaii due to public safety concerns and inadequate deterrence from current laws. It proposes increasing penalties for various violations, including importing, purchasing, possessing, or discharging fireworks without proper licensing or permits. Crucially, the bill establishes significantly higher penalties for subsequent violations, escalating them to Class A felonies for repeat offenders. Additionally, it appropriates funds to the department of law enforcement and county fire departments to bolster investigation and enforcement efforts against illegal firework activity, with specific allocations for each county. The Act is set to take effect on July 1, 2025.
14. HB895_: This bill, HB895, aims to strengthen the enforcement of fireworks laws across Hawaii's counties. It appropriates funds for the Honolulu, Hawaii, Maui, and Kauai police departments to hire additional personnel. Specifically, each department will receive funding for four full-time equivalent positions dedicated to enforcing fireworks regulations. The legislation mandates that these enforcement efforts include the use of unmarked vehicles and officers in civilian clothing, as well as the immediate issuance of citations. These measures are intended to enhance the effectiveness of fireworks law enforcement statewide, with the act taking effect on July 1, 2025.
15. HB200_: This bill aims to reduce the risks and disruptions associated with consumer fireworks in Hawaii. It proposes to limit their use, allowing them only for cultural purposes via a permit. The current authorization for non-cultural use on New Year's Eve, Fourth of July, and Chinese New Year's Day will be discontinued. The bill clarifies definitions for "consumer fireworks" and "cultural events," and amends existing statutes to reflect these changes. Importantly, this Act does not prohibit the use of display fireworks or aerial devices by licensed professionals.
16. HB1305_: This bill, HB1305, aims to address the public safety risks associated with illegal fireworks in Hawaii by establishing a comprehensive education and marketing program. The legislature finds that public education campaigns are effective in changing behavior, citing smoking cessation as an example. Consequently, the bill mandates that the Department of Education, in collaboration with the Department of Health, develop this program. The program will be implemented in public schools, including charter schools, and distributed to private schools across the state. This initiative is designed to increase community awareness and promote safer conduct regarding fireworks, taking effect on July 1, 2025.

Response: ## Analysis

The search bill, HB1483, seeks to enhance public safety by creating a new adjudication system for fireworks infractions and imposing stricter penalties for violations. The provided similar bills address the same core issue of illegal fireworks in Hawaii but approach the problem through a variety of legislative strategies. These strategies can be grouped into several distinct themes.

The most direct supporters of HB1483 are bills that propose similar systemic legal reforms. **HB1005** and **SB1324** are nearly identical in their approach, mirroring HB1483's call for a new adjudication system for minor infractions, revised definitions, and enhanced penalties, particularly when injuries or fatalities occur. These bills represent a shared legislative philosophy centered on reforming the judicial process to make enforcement more efficient and impactful.

A second major theme is a direct focus on **penalty enhancement**. Bills like **HB607**, **HB83**, **HB187**, and **SB476** isolate the punitive aspect of fireworks control. They propose creating new felonies for causing harm (HB607), escalating penalties for repeat offenses (HB83), and increasing fines across the board (HB187, SB476). These bills strongly align with a key component of HB1483, reinforcing the idea that current penalties are an insufficient deterrent.

Another cluster of bills concentrates on **enforcement and interdiction**. These bills provide the operational and financial means to enforce fireworks laws. **HB895** and **HB806** appropriate funds for police departments to hire more personnel and conduct sting operations. **SR207** focuses on supply-chain interdiction, urging the use of scanning technology at ports and airports to stop illegal fireworks from entering the state. These measures complement the legal framework proposed by HB1483 by strengthening the state's capacity for enforcement.

A different strategic approach involves **prohibition and restriction**. Instead of focusing on enforcing laws against illegal use, bills like **SB611**, **HB633**, and **HB200** aim to reduce the supply and availability of fireworks. They propose broad bans on most fireworks, restrict consumer use to specific cultural events, or enact comprehensive new control laws. While their method is more preventative (upstream) than HB1483's enforcement-focused (downstream) approach, they share the ultimate goal of reducing fireworks-related harm.

Finally, a set of bills promotes **community-based and educational initiatives**. **HCR135**, **HR129**, and **HB1305** advocate for "softer" solutions like establishing illegal fireworks disposal programs and implementing public education campaigns in schools. These non-punitive measures aim to reduce the number of illegal fireworks in communities and shift public behavior through awareness.

In direct opposition to the central theme of HB1483 is **SB1052**, which proposes to *reduce* penalties for certain minor possession offenses from a criminal misdemeanor to a civil violation. While the stated intent is to streamline enforcement, this approach directly contracts with the "stricter penalties" provision of HB1483 and the many other bills seeking to increase fines and criminal charges.

In summary, nearly all the bills support the overarching goal of HB1483 to curb illegal fireworks. They do so through a diverse set of complementary strategies, including legal reform, harsher penalties, better enforcement, prohibition, and education. Only one bill presents a competing philosophy by advocating for penalty reduction.

## Supporting Bills
**HB1005_**: This bill is highly similar to HB1483, proposing a dedicated adjudication system for fireworks infractions, enhancing penalties, and appropriating funds, thereby supporting the same comprehensive reform strategy.
**SB1324_**: Like HB1483, this bill establishes a civil adjudication process for fireworks infractions, revises penalties, and provides funding, making it a strong supporter of the same systemic changes.
**HB607_**: This bill supports HB1483's goal of stricter penalties by creating a specific Class A felony for causing serious injury or death with fireworks, directly addressing the most severe consequences of their misuse.
**HB806_**: This bill supports the overall cause by funding police sting operations and creating a novel penalty (pension forfeiture), enhancing the state's ability to enforce the laws that HB1483 seeks to reform.
**SB611_**: This bill supports the goal of public safety by proposing a comprehensive revision of fireworks laws to significantly restrict the sale and use of most fireworks, offering a preventative approach.
**HCR135_**: This resolution supports the cause by proposing a non-punitive, community-based solution—illegal fireworks disposal programs—to reduce the quantity of dangerous materials in public hands.
**HB633_**: This bill supports the public safety goal by proposing a near-total ban on most fireworks, aiming to eliminate the problem at the source.
**SR207_**: This resolution supports the cause by focusing on interdiction, requesting scanning technology at ports and airports to stop the importation of illegal fireworks, which complements enforcement efforts.
**HR129_**: This resolution, similar to HCR135, supports the cause by urging the creation of programs for the safe disposal of illegal fireworks, enhancing community safety.
**HB187_**: This bill directly supports a key component of HB1483 by increasing the maximum fines for fireworks violations to create a stronger financial deterrent.
**SB476_**: This bill is a direct supporter of stricter penalties, mirroring HB187's proposal to increase fines for fireworks violations.
**HB83_**: This bill strongly supports the goal of stricter penalties by increasing them for various offenses and escalating charges to felonies for repeat offenders, while also funding enforcement.
**HB895_**: This bill supports the overall cause by appropriating funds for dedicated police personnel to enforce fireworks laws, providing the resources needed for effective implementation of any legal changes.
**HB200_**: This bill supports the cause by taking a restrictive approach, limiting the use of consumer fireworks to cultural purposes only, thereby reducing the overall volume of fireworks being used.
**HB1305_**: This bill supports the cause through a preventative, long-term strategy of creating a public education program in schools to change behavior and awareness around fireworks safety.

## Contracting/Competing Bills
**SB1052_**: This bill directly contracts with HB1483's aim of introducing stricter penalties. It proposes to *reduce* the penalty for possessing smaller amounts of illegal fireworks from a misdemeanor to a civil violation, which is the opposite of the punitive approach favored by the search bill.

## Unrelated Bills
There are no unrelated bills in this list, as all pertain to the regulation, enforcement, or consequences of fireworks use in Hawaii.

Analyze the following similar bills found for HB727_:

**Search Bill:**
HB727_: This bill aims to address the increasing incarceration rates of women in Hawaii by establishing three-year women's court pilot programs in the second, third, and fifth circuits. Recognizing that women offenders often face unique challenges stemming from trauma, poverty, and caregiving responsibilities, these programs will focus on non-violent women at high risk of recidivism. Key provisions include implementing trauma-informed and gender-responsive practices, providing services like mental health treatment, substance abuse support, family support, and housing assistance. The judiciary will receive an appropriation for operational costs and temporary staff, and will report on the program's progress and provide recommendations for its future. The pilot programs are set to begin on July 1, 2025, and will sunset on June 30, 2028.

**Similar Bills:**
1. SB526_: This bill, SB526, aims to address the disproportionate increase of women in Hawaii's correctional facilities by establishing a three-year women's court pilot program. Building on a successful pilot in the first circuit, this Act will expand the program to the second, third, and fifth circuits. The program will utilize trauma-informed and gender-responsive practices to offer a range of services, including mental health treatment, family support, life-skills training, and substance abuse services.

2. SB1628_: This bill aims to address Hawaii's high rates of homelessness by establishing a homeless triage and treatment center program within the Department of Health's alcohol and drug abuse division. The program will serve individuals experiencing homelessness or at risk of homelessness who have substance abuse or mental health issues. Key provisions include providing access to essential services like food, shelter, and housing navigation, alongside medical assessments, substance abuse treatment, detoxification, and behavioral health services. The centers will also offer trauma-informed and culturally-based life skills groups to improve engagement and retention.

Recognizing the critical need for immediate access to specialized care for individuals with substance abuse issues and mental illness, the program will provide essential services like detox, behavioral health support, and housing navigation. The legislation appropriates funds for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027 to implement this program, which will collaborate with various community entities to offer trauma-informed and culturally-based support. The goal is to bridge a significant gap in behavioral health care for vulnerable populations, enabling quicker access to treatment and resources.
4. HB1383_: This bill establishes a five-year Family Resilience Pilot Program within Hawaii's Office of Wellness and Resilience. The program aims to address unmet needs of families at risk of child welfare system involvement by providing trauma-informed peer support navigators, financial assistance for basic needs, and a parenting intervention program. This initiative is based on recommendations from the Malama Ohana Working Group and successful diversion programs in other states. The bill appropriates $1,468,500 for each of fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027 to establish and implement this pilot program. The program is set to conclude on June 30, 2030, with a report on its effectiveness due to the legislature by 2031.
5. HB1079_: This bill, HB1079, aims to implement trauma-informed care within Hawaii's Department of Human Services child welfare services branch. Recognizing the significant trauma experienced by the families they serve, the legislature is directing the Office of Wellness and Resilience to collaborate with the Department of Human Services. Together, they will design and administer a program that includes trauma-informed organizational assessments and a comprehensive training curriculum for staff. This curriculum will address vicarious trauma and burnout among staff, incorporate evidence-based assessment tools, and establish ongoing support and specialized supervisor training. The bill appropriates $425,000 for each of fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027 to fund these initiatives, with the Act taking effect on July 1, 2025.
6. HB648_: This bill establishes a two-year pilot program within the First Circuit's Probate and Family Courts to address accessibility issues in guardianship and conservatorship proceedings. The program aims to ensure that respondents who cannot afford them have access to crucial court-ordered resources like "kokua kanawai," guardians ad litem, and professional evaluations. These resources provide essential independent assessments to support informed judicial decisions regarding a respondent's capacity and circumstances. The Judiciary is mandated to report on the program's progress and provide recommendations for its future. A total of $200,000 is appropriated for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027 to fund this initiative.
7. SB950_: This bill aims to foster a trauma-informed child welfare system in Hawaii by appropriating funds to the Office of Wellness and Resilience. The office will be responsible for designing and implementing trauma-informed organizational assessments and a comprehensive training curriculum for the Department of Human Services' child welfare services branch. Key provisions include assessing policies for trauma-informed practices, measuring worker well-being, and establishing a trained mentor cohort and specialized supervisor training. The bill also allows for contracting with external entities and allocates $425,000 for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027 to support these initiatives. This legislative effort seeks to prevent retraumatization of children and families within the system.
8. SB189_: This bill, SB189, aims to reduce breast cancer incidence and deaths by mandating insurance coverage for early breast cancer screenings. It expands existing coverage to include annual mammograms for women with an above-average risk, a formal risk factor screening assessment for women aged 30 and older, and medically necessary supplemental imaging like MRIs and ultrasounds for any age group. The legislation builds on a previous auditor's assessment and clarifies definitions for "digital breast tomosynthesis" and "low-dose mammography." These expanded screenings will take effect for policies issued on or before January 1, 2026.
9. SB788_: Senate Bill 788 establishes a two-year pilot program within the Judiciary's first circuit probate and family courts to address accessibility issues with essential guardianship and conservatorship resources. The program aims to ensure that individuals who cannot afford these services, such as kokua kanawai, guardians ad litem, and professional evaluations, can still receive them when deemed beneficial by the court. This initiative is a response to findings from a legislative working group that identified financial barriers as a significant impediment to equitable outcomes for respondents. The Judiciary will submit reports on the program's progress and provide recommendations for its future. The bill appropriates $200,000 total over two fiscal years to fund this pilot program.
10. HB593_: This bill establishes a pilot program within the Department of Health to provide intensive mobile mental health services to chronically houseless adults with serious brain disorders, prioritizing those with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. The program will operate one mobile team, managing up to forty participants, and offer crisis response, hospital liaison, and housing placement assistance. It also includes provisions for psychiatric medication initiation, assisted community treatment orders, and collaboration with various agencies. The pilot program is funded with $1.3 million for two fiscal years and is set to conclude on June 30, 2028, with mandatory reports to the legislature on its progress.
11. HB1376_: This bill aims to phase out Hawaii's use of private, out-of-state correctional facilities. The legislature finds that these facilities, particularly for-profit ones, have negatively impacted inmates and their families, especially Native Hawaiians, by causing isolation and hindering successful reentry into society. To address this, the bill prohibits the state from housing inmates in private correctional institutions beginning July 1, 2030, while retaining authority for public facilities. Furthermore, it mandates that the Hawaii Correctional System Oversight Commission must approve any new correctional facility construction or expansion. This ensures greater oversight and community involvement in the state's correctional infrastructure planning as the use of private prisons diminishes.
12. HB127_: This bill aims to reform Hawaii's pretrial release system, acknowledging that cash bail disproportionately harms low-income individuals and people of color. It requires courts to record written justifications for imposing release conditions and mandates that bail amounts be affordable based on a defendant's financial situation. Key provisions include excluding public benefits and income below the federal poverty level when assessing a defendant's ability to pay bail. The legislation also presumes inability to pay for those with no income other than public benefits or who are in households below 150% of the federal poverty level. These changes are intended to reduce pretrial incarceration, address jail overcrowding, and lower state expenses, taking effect on July 1, 2025.
13. HB1263_: This bill establishes a legislative moratorium from July 1, 2025, to June 30, 2028, halting the planning and construction of new or expanded correctional facilities in Hawaii, particularly the replacement of the Oahu Community Correctional Center. The moratorium prohibits public-private partnerships for such projects due to concerns about transparency and public participation. Concurrently, the bill creates and funds a criminal justice diversion task force, mandated to recommend policies for reducing jail populations, addressing systemic issues like homelessness and substance use, and promoting alternatives to incarceration. This task force will focus on data-driven strategies and culturally informed approaches to reform Hawaii's correctional system.
14. SB734_: This bill aims to address Hawaii's shortage of social workers by creating a social work training program for nonviolent incarcerated individuals. The Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, in collaboration with the Department of Human Services, will develop and establish this program. This initiative will allow eligible incarcerated individuals to explore a career in social work and become assistants to licensed social workers. The bill also mandates progress reports to the legislature and appropriates funds for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027 to implement the program, which will take effect on July 1, 2025.
15. HB1197_: This bill aims to reform Hawaii's prison system by expanding mental health care services for inmates. It authorizes the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to prioritize student education partnerships to increase the number of clinical psychologists and mental health providers in correctional facilities. The bill also provides additional long-term funding for the department to expand its clinical psychology training programs. This initiative is driven by findings of severe overcrowding and the need for specialized mental health care for incarcerated individuals. The legislature believes these partnerships can lead to necessary prison reform and improve the delivery of mental health services.
16. SB1612_: This bill establishes a five-year fitness to proceed pilot program, managed by the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation in conjunction with the Department of Health. The program aims to alleviate overcrowding at the Hawaii State Hospital and enhance staff safety by providing dedicated space for incapacitated inmates or those awaiting a fitness to proceed determination. The program requires reserving one cell for every two eligible inmates, with joint responsibility shared between the departments until the inmate is no longer incapacitated or their fitness is determined. The Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation is mandated to submit both an interim report in 2027 and a final report with recommendations by 2030. The bill also appropriates funds for the program's implementation across fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027.
17. SB1399_: This bill establishes a five-year Family Resilience Pilot Program within Hawaii's Office of Wellness and Resilience, funded by approximately $987,150 per fiscal year for FY2025-2026 and FY2026-2027. The program aims to increase family resilience and reduce child abuse and neglect by providing trauma-informed peer support navigators with lived experience. These navigators will assist families with public benefits enrollment and connect them to family strengthening and cultural programming. Additionally, the program will offer financial and resource support for essential needs like food, housing, and transportation. The Office of Wellness and Resilience must establish a data tracking system and an evaluation plan by December 31, 2025, with the program set to expire on June 30, 2030.
18. HB1002_: This bill aims to strengthen the oversight of Hawaii's correctional system. It primarily seeks to extend the term of the oversight coordinator for the Hawaii Correctional System Oversight Commission from two to four years. Additionally, the bill clarifies the oversight coordinator's authority to inspect agencies and correctional facilities without prior notice. This enhanced authority allows for more thorough investigations and a better commitment to the system's transition towards a rehabilitative and therapeutic model. The proposed changes are set to take effect on July 1, 2025.
19. SB173_: This bill establishes a three-year pilot program within the Hawaii Judiciary to offer free child care services. The program aims to assist minor children of parties and witnesses attending court hearings in the first circuit, though it will only be available in a designated area. The Judiciary is required to report on the program's findings and recommendations to the Legislature annually. A total of $800,000 is appropriated for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027 to fund the establishment and operation of this child care initiative. The act is set to take effect on July 1, 2025.

Response: ## Analysis

The search bill, HB727, is part of a significant and cohesive legislative effort to reform Hawaii's criminal justice system by emphasizing rehabilitation, diversion, and trauma-informed care over traditional incarceration. The similar bills found largely support and reinforce this agenda, targeting the issue from various angles, from pre-trial reform to in-facility services and post-release support.

The most direct support comes from **SB526**, which is the Senate companion bill, proposing an identical women's court pilot program. This indicates strong bicameral support for the specific initiative.

A larger group of bills supports the broader goals of HB727. These can be grouped into several themes:
1.  **Reducing Incarceration and Systemic Reform:** Bills like **HB127** (bail reform), **HB1263** (moratorium on new jail construction), **HB1376** (phasing out private prisons), and **HB1002** (strengthening correctional oversight) all aim to decrease the state's reliance on incarceration. They create a policy environment where diversionary programs like the women's court are not just beneficial but necessary alternatives.
2.  **Implementing Trauma-Informed Care:** A core tenet of HB727 is its "trauma-informed and gender-responsive" approach. Several other bills, including **HB1079**, **SB950**, **HB1383**, and **SB1399**, seek to embed this same trauma-informed methodology into other state systems, particularly child and family welfare services. This demonstrates a consistent, statewide strategy to address trauma as a root cause of negative social outcomes.
3.  **Addressing Root Causes:** The women's court in HB727 aims to provide services for mental health, substance abuse, and housing instability. Bills like **SB1628** and **HB943** (homeless triage centers), **HB593** (mobile mental health for the homeless), **HB1197**, and **SB1612** (mental health for inmates) directly establish programs to tackle these underlying drivers of criminal justice involvement. They function as complementary, upstream solutions that could reduce the number of women who would need the diversion program in the first place.

There are no contracting or competing bills in the provided list. The legislative momentum is clearly aligned with the principles of therapeutic justice and reducing the prison population.

Finally, a few bills are unrelated despite surface-level similarities. Bills like **HB648**, **SB788**, and **SB173** also propose pilot programs within the Judiciary, but their focus is on civil court matters (guardianship, child care access) rather than criminal justice diversion. Similarly, **SB189** is unrelated as its focus is on women's physical healthcare and insurance mandates, a separate policy domain.

## Supporting Bills
*   **SB526_**: This is the direct Senate companion bill to HB727, establishing the identical three-year women's court pilot program in the same circuits with the same goals and methods.
*   **HB1263_**: This bill supports HB727 by halting new correctional facility construction and creating a task force to find alternatives to incarceration, which is precisely what the women's court program provides.
*   **HB127_**: This bill aims to reduce pretrial incarceration through bail reform, aligning with HB727's overall goal of decreasing the number of people, particularly from vulnerable populations, held in correctional facilities.
*   **HB1376_**: By phasing out private, out-of-state prisons to keep inmates closer to their families and communities, this bill supports the rehabilitative and reintegration goals central to the women's court program.
*   **HB1002_**: This bill strengthens oversight of the correctional system to encourage a more "rehabilitative and therapeutic model," directly supporting the policy framework that underpins the women's court program.
*   **SB734_**: By creating a social work training program for incarcerated individuals, this bill promotes rehabilitation and successful reentry, which complements the diversionary and support-based approach of HB727.
*   **HB1079_** and **SB950_**: These companion bills support the core methodology of HB727 by seeking to implement trauma-informed care practices across the child welfare system, indicating a broader legislative commitment to this therapeutic approach.
*   **HB1383_** and **SB1399_**: These companion bills establish a Family Resilience Pilot Program using trauma-informed peer support, directly aligning with HB727's focus on addressing trauma and supporting families to prevent system involvement.
*   **SB1628_** and **HB943_**: These companion bills address root causes of incarceration by creating homeless triage centers that provide trauma-informed substance abuse and mental health services, offering upstream support for the same population HB727 serves.
*   **HB593_**: This bill provides mobile mental health services to the homeless, tackling one of the key challenges faced by the women targeted in HB727 and thus supporting its goal of reducing incarceration through treatment.
*   **HB1197_**: By expanding mental health care services within correctional facilities, this bill addresses the same critical need for mental health treatment for justice-involved individuals that is a cornerstone of the HB727 diversion program.
*   **SB1612_**: This bill creates a pilot program for inmates with severe mental illness awaiting fitness to proceed determinations, reinforcing the theme of providing specialized mental health care to the justice-involved population.

## Contracting/Competing Bills
There are no bills in this list that oppose or offer a competing approach to the goals and methods outlined in HB727.

## Unrelated Bills
*   **HB648_** and **SB788_**: These companion bills establish a judiciary pilot program for guardianship and conservatorship proceedings in civil court. This is unrelated to the criminal justice diversion focus of HB727.
*   **SB173_**: This bill creates a pilot program for free child care in court. While it supports families interacting with the judiciary, its purpose is to improve access to the courts, not to provide a therapeutic alternative to incarceration.
*   **SB189_**: This bill focuses on women's health by mandating insurance coverage for breast cancer screenings. It is unrelated to criminal justice reform.

This legislation repeals existing separate conference center revolving funds for the University of Hawaii at Hilo and community colleges, transferring their balances to the new consolidated fund. An annual report will be required to detail income and expenditures for each account within the new revolving fund. The act takes effect on July 1, 2025.

**Similar Bills:**
1. SB1488_: This bill establishes a statewide "University of Hawaii Conference Center Revolving Fund" to manage conference center programs across the entire university system. This new fund will consolidate and replace existing revolving funds for the University of Hawaii at Hilo and individual community colleges. The university is authorized to collect fees for services and expend these funds for various conference-related costs, with the flexibility to bypass standard competitive bidding requirements. An annual report to the legislature detailing income and expenditures will be required for each account within the fund. This change aims to streamline administration and improve the management of conference center operations within the University of Hawaii.
2. SB326_: This bill, SB326, aims to enhance the criteria for establishing and continuing revolving funds in Hawaii. The legislature will now be required to ensure that any revolving fund serves a demonstrated need and has a clear nexus between benefits and charges. Crucially, the bill mandates that revolving funds must be financially self-sustaining. This self-sustainability will be proven through either annual projections showing no reliance on general funds or a schedule for collecting outstanding payments to capitalize the fund. The goal is to prevent revolving funds from becoming an automatic support mechanism outside the normal budget process.
3. HB1025_: This bill, HB1025, aims to provide consistent state funding for the East-West Center, a pivotal institution fostering understanding between the US and Asia-Pacific nations. It officially designates the Center as the "State of Hawaii Center for Cultural and Technical Interchange Between East and West, Inc." The primary legislative purpose is to authorize annual general fund appropriations, exempt from specific Chapter 42F requirements, to support the Center's programs. To receive these state funds, the Center must meet several conditions, including being licensed, complying with anti-discrimination laws, and not using funds for entertainment or lobbying. This Act ensures regular state financial support while respecting the Center's autonomy.
4. HB1010_: This bill establishes a "mixed-income subaccount" within the Rental Housing Revolving Fund to address Hawaii's housing crisis. The purpose is to provide a dedicated funding source for mixed-income rental housing projects, specifically targeting households earning up to 140% of the area median income. Currently, the revolving fund prioritizes low-income projects, leaving insufficient funds for developments serving working families. The new subaccount will allow the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation to offer loans for these projects, with preferences given to those with diverse affordability ranges and located on public land. The bill also authorizes the transfer of funds from the main revolving fund to this new subaccount.
5. SB164_: This bill, SB164, aims to improve housing development in Hawaii by renaming the Rental Housing Revolving Fund to the State Housing Revolving Fund (SHRF) and expanding its uses. It clarifies eligible applicants to include organizations that reinvest profits into housing and government agencies, and also establishes a new Housing Efficiency and Innovation Subaccount within the SHRF. Key provisions include prioritizing projects with the shortest loan repayment terms that yield the most units per dollar annually. Additionally, a working group is established to revise the state's qualified allocation plan and loan terms, with a report due in 2026. The bill also allocates a portion of conveyance taxes to the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund and removes an annual cap on SHRF funding from conveyance taxes.
6. HB840_: This bill, HB840, aims to appropriate funds for the University of Hawaii's athletics programs. It allocates a total of $8,519,341 for each of fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027. These funds are designated for the University of Hawaii at Manoa athletics ($3,200,000 annually) and the University of Hawaii at Hilo athletics ($800,000 annually). Additionally, $4,519,341 annually is earmarked to establish forty-three temporary full-time equivalent positions at the Manoa athletics department to provide further support. The act takes effect on July 1, 2025.
7. HCR31_: This House Concurrent Resolution (HCR31) requests the University of Hawaii to explore the feasibility of establishing an Alzheimer's disease research center. The main legislative purpose is to advance scientific research and improve care for Alzheimer's patients in Hawaii. Key provisions include investigating the University's current capabilities and assessing the benefits of such a center. Importantly, the resolution also requires the University to identify the specific requirements for securing federal funding from the National Institute on Aging. The University must develop a phased plan and submit a report on its findings to the Legislature by December 31, 2025.
8. HB1171_: This bill, HB1171, aims to amend the University of Hawaii's tuition and fees special fund. The main legislative purpose is to allow the Board of Regents to expend up to $3,000,000 annually from this fund for student aid in direct response to emergencies or disasters declared by the governor. Key provisions include requiring comprehensive reports to the legislature detailing the use of these funds. The bill also clarifies existing provisions regarding the fund's use for programs, operations, alumni relations, and private donation generation. Importantly, the bill specifies that this new authority for emergency student aid will take effect on July 1, 2025.
9. SCR137_: This Senate Concurrent Resolution requests the Office of the Auditor to conduct a performance audit of the University of Hawaii Foundation. The foundation is responsible for fundraising and managing over seven thousand gift accounts to support the University of Hawaii System. Given the significant funds raised, including over $660 million from the "For UH For Hawaii" campaign, the resolution emphasizes the need for efficient, effective, and transparent use of these funds. The audit aims to identify shortfalls and areas for improvement to ensure the productive use of funds supporting students and faculty. Certified copies of the resolution will be sent to the Auditor and leadership of the University of Hawaii Foundation.
10. HB1208_: This bill, HB1208, aims to address Hawaii's high cost of living, particularly housing costs and homelessness, by increasing the conveyance tax. The legislative purpose is to generate more sustainable revenue for affordable housing initiatives, land conservation, and homeless services. Key provisions include establishing a new Homeless Services Special Fund, allowing counties to access matching funds for affordable housing projects, and significantly increasing conveyance tax rates for properties above a certain value. Additionally, the bill establishes conveyance tax rates for multifamily residential properties and creates new exemptions for certain non-profit organizations and owner/renter-occupants. The allocated conveyance tax revenues will now be distributed among the Affordable Homeownership Revolving Fund, Homeless Services Special Fund, Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund, Land Conservation Fund, and Rental Housing Revolving Fund.
11. HB1168_: This bill authorizes the University of Hawaii's Board of Regents to issue revenue bonds totaling up to $800,000,000 to address critical capital facility needs. These funds will support the construction, renovation, modernization, and repair of various university projects, including housing, classrooms, laboratories, and other infrastructure. The revenue bonds will be issued under existing Hawaii Revised Statutes and secured by university revenues. The University of Hawaii is required to notify the legislature with a detailed list of projects funded by these bonds.
12. SB41_: This bill amends Hawaii Revised Statutes concerning the conveyance tax. Its main legislative purpose is to allocate a portion of conveyance tax collections to fund housing development and infrastructure programs. Key provisions include dedicating ten percent of conveyance tax collections to the Dwelling Unit Revolving Fund. Additionally, the bill removes the annual cap on conveyance taxes paid into the Rental Housing Revolving Fund. These changes aim to provide dedicated funding streams for crucial housing and infrastructure initiatives across the state. The act is scheduled to take effect on July 1, 2025.
13. SB87_: This bill proposes to appropriate funds for the establishment of three new permanent full-time equivalent mental health practitioner positions within the University of Hawaii's Division of Student Success, specifically for the Counseling and Student Development Center.

The Act is set to take effect on July 1, 2025.
14. SB1571_: This bill aims to enhance the Hawaii Tourism Authority's (HTA) administrative flexibility and operational effectiveness. A key provision exempts all positions within the HTA from state civil service laws, allowing for more agile recruitment and management. It also grants the HTA broad powers, including entering into contracts for up to five years and agreements for convention center use for up to ten years, provided sufficient funds are available. Furthermore, the bill amends the definition of "convention center facility" to better reflect a "Hawaii sense of place" and adjusts eligibility requirements for the HTA board of directors. These changes are intended to support the HTA's strategic tourism management and the development of a regenerative visitor industry.
15. SB1603_: This bill appropriates funds for various capital improvement projects within Hawaii's third senatorial district.

18. SB986_: This bill amends Hawaii Revised Statutes to broaden the criteria for declaring a tourism emergency to include terrorist threats and other catastrophic events, and removes national/global economic crises from this scope.

Response: ## Analysis

The search bill, **HB1169**, focuses on improving the administrative and financial efficiency of the University of Hawaii (UH) system. Its primary mechanism is the creation of a new, consolidated "University of Hawaii Conference Center Revolving Fund." This fund aims to streamline the management of conference-related income and expenditures across all UH campuses by replacing disparate existing funds, centralizing control, and notably, exempting expenditures from standard competitive bidding requirements. The core themes are financial consolidation, administrative flexibility, and operational efficiency specifically for the University of Hawaii.

The similar bills can be categorized based on their relationship to these core themes.

The most closely related bill is **SB1488**, which is a companion or identical bill to HB1169. It proposes the exact same statewide UH Conference Center Revolving Fund with the same objectives and provisions, making it a direct supporter of the same legislative goal.

Another group of bills supports the broader theme of granting the University of Hawaii greater financial autonomy and flexibility. **HB1171** allows the UH to use its tuition and fees special fund for emergency student aid, and **HB1168** authorizes the university to issue significant revenue bonds for capital improvements. While they address different specific needs (student aid, construction) than HB1169 (conference centers), they share the common legislative intent of empowering UH with the financial tools necessary to manage its diverse operations effectively. **SB326** also supports this effort by establishing stricter, clearer criteria for all state revolving funds, thereby providing a sound governance framework that would ensure the fund created by HB1169 is self-sustaining and fiscally responsible.

No bills in the provided list directly contract or compete with the objectives of HB1169. There are no proposals to prohibit the consolidation of these funds, to enforce competitive bidding on these specific services, or to dissolve the UH's conference center programs.

A significant number of the provided bills are unrelated to HB1169. These can be grouped into several distinct categories. Several bills, such as **HB1010**, **SB164**, **HB1208**, and **SB41**, deal with state-level housing finance, conveyance taxes, and various housing-related revolving funds, which are entirely separate from the University of Hawaii's internal operations. Another set of bills, including **HB840** and **SB87**, involves direct general fund appropriations for specific UH programs (athletics and mental health, respectively), a funding mechanism distinct from the fee-for-service revolving fund model in HB1169. Other unrelated bills concern different state agencies (**SB1571** for the Hawaii Tourism Authority), broad capital improvement projects (**SB1603**), state government reorganization (**HB450**), or non-binding resolutions requesting studies (**HCR31**, **SCR203**) or audits (**SCR137**).

## Supporting Bills
*   **SB1488_**: This is a companion bill that is substantively identical to HB1169. It establishes the same consolidated University of Hawaii Conference Center Revolving Fund to streamline operations, consolidate funding, and bypass standard competitive bidding for conference expenses.
*   **HB1171_**: This bill supports the theme of increasing financial flexibility for the University of Hawaii. It amends a different UH fund (the tuition and fees special fund) to allow expenditures for emergency student aid, mirroring HB1169's goal of giving UH more agile control over its financial resources.
*   **HB1168_**: This bill empowers the University of Hawaii with another significant financial tool by authorizing the issuance of up to $800 million in revenue bonds for capital projects. Like HB1169, it provides the university with the financial authority needed to manage its system-wide infrastructure and operations.
*   **SB326_**: This bill supports the responsible implementation of HB1169 by creating a stronger governance framework for all revolving funds. It mandates that such funds be self-sustaining and serve a demonstrated need, ensuring that the new conference center fund proposed in HB1169 adheres to principles of fiscal accountability.

## Contracting/Competing Bills  
There are no bills in the provided list that contract or compete with the legislative intent of HB1169.

## Unrelated Bills
*   **HB1025_**: This bill provides state funding for the East-West Center, an affiliated but distinct entity, through general fund appropriations, not a revolving fund for UH operations.
*   **HB1010_**: This bill is unrelated as it deals with housing finance, establishing a subaccount within the Rental Housing Revolving Fund, a subject matter completely separate from the University of Hawaii.
*   **SB164_**: This bill focuses on housing development by renaming and expanding the uses of the state's main housing revolving fund, which is not connected to the University of Hawaii.
*   **HB840_**: This bill provides direct appropriations for UH athletics programs. It is a specific budget allocation, not the creation of a self-sustaining revolving fund for administrative purposes.
*   **HCR31_**: This is an unrelated, non-binding resolution requesting the University of Hawaii to conduct a feasibility study for an Alzheimer's disease research center, focusing on academic program development, not financial administration.
*   **SCR137_**: This resolution requests a performance audit of the University of Hawaii Foundation, a separate fundraising entity. It is concerned with oversight and accountability of private donations, not the administration of a state-managed revolving fund.
*   **HB1208_**: This bill is unrelated as it focuses on state-level tax policy, increasing the conveyance tax to fund affordable housing and homeless services through various state funds.
*   **SB41_**: This bill concerns state tax policy by allocating a portion of the conveyance tax to housing-related revolving funds, a topic unrelated to UH's internal conference fund.
*   **SB87_**: This bill appropriates funds for specific mental health positions at UH. Like HB840, it is a direct budget appropriation for personnel and services, not a financial restructuring bill.
*   **SB1571_**: This bill is unrelated as it grants administrative flexibility and civil service exemptions to the Hawaii Tourism Authority, a different state agency.
*   **SB1603_**: This bill appropriates funds for various capital improvement projects within a specific senatorial district, making it a broad-based capital budget bill, not one focused on UH financial structures.
*   **SCR203_**: This is an unrelated concurrent resolution, substantively identical to HCR31, requesting a feasibility study for an Alzheimer's center at the University of Hawaii.
*   **HB341_**: This bill authorizes special purpose revenue bonds for the Hawaii Island Community Health Center, a non-profit healthcare provider, and is not connected to the University of Hawaii.
*   **SB986_**: This bill is unrelated as it amends the criteria and funding for the Tourism Emergency Special Fund, a fund managed for a different purpose and by a different agency.
*   **HB450_**: This bill deals with the reorganization of state government by transferring cultural agencies to a different department, a matter of administrative structure unrelated to UH finances.
