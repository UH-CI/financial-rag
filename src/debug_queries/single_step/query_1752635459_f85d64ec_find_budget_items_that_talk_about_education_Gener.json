The revenue source is derived by who is paying the\nfee or tax and for what purpose. Agencies can group paying entities together as a single revenue\nsource if there is a close subject matter or statutory connection among the entities paying the fee\nor tax, or the purpose for which it is paid.\nFor example, if the bill authorizes fee increases for all health professional licenses, do not group\nall these increases together. You can group all licenses of professions regulated by the same\nboard or commission under the same chapter of law.\nAs another example, the Gambling Commission would not group together as one fee all\ngambling-related licenses, but could group together (in a single fee) all licenses that relate to\nbingo activity.\nA fiscal note doesn\u2019t distinguish between different fees if the account and revenue source code\nare the same. In contrast, agencies should make this distinction on the 10-year analysis form,\nusing a descriptive title for the tax or fee based on the information in the bill. Note that the 10-\nyear cost analysis must include the tax or fee name and the account code where your agency will\ndeposit the revenue and cash receipts, but does not require revenue source codes or associated\ntitles.\nOffice of Financial Management Page 56 of 61 January 2017",

Further, implementation of Text to Donate services and Marketing and Outreach would cost\n$0.2 million in fiscal year 2022, and $0.1 million in fiscal year 2023 and subsequent fiscal years.\nThis analysis assumes that costs in fiscal year 2022 ($0.3 million) will be funded through General Revenue in\norder to develop the program, procure vendors, market the program, and begin accrual of funds for\ndisbursement. All costs thereafter will be funded through Appropriated Receipts collected through donations to\nthe program.\nBased on information provided by DHCA, the agency anticipates collecting $1.4 million in donations per fiscal\nyear, and expending $1.2 million in grants to municipalities, $0.1 million in administration and professional\nservices, and $0.1 million in marketing and outreach, per fiscal year in Appropriated Receipts.\nJULY 21, 2022 6\n",

Lieutenant Governor, Attorney General, Secretary of State, Superintendent of Public\nInstruction, and Public Service Commissioner are capitalized when followed by the\nperson\u2019s name. Otherwise, do not capitalize titles. In general, do not capitalize job titles\n(social worker II, deputy administrator, MSU professor).\nC. The various funds and trusts are not capitalized (general fund, education trust, resource\nindemnity trust, coal tax trust, pay plan, school foundation program). Do not capitalize\nstate or federal unless the word is part of a formal name (subject to federal laws; the\nFederal Reserve Board).\nD. Do capitalize formal organizational names (Disability Services Division, Water Quality\nBureau, Water Development Program). Spell out names of agencies and programs in\nthe first reference and follow up with the acronym in parenthesis; use the acronym\nthereafter [the Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks (FWP); the Board of Investments\n(BOI)]. Use the acronym that has common usage in agency documents rather than your\nown creation.\nE. Do not capitalize council, board, or department after the first formal reference. For\ninstance: The Board of Regents...the board; the Department of Administration\u2026the\ndepartment; the Reserved Water Rights Compact Commission...the commission.\nF. Executive budget is capitalized when it is used as part of a formal name (the Governor's\nExecutive Budget, the 2027 Biennium Executive Budget, FY 2026-FY 2027 Executive\nBudget), but not in general references (The executive budget recommendations\ninclude...).\n10. Other Grammatical Guidelines:\nA. Try not to use the word \"this\" as the subject for a sentence. For instance: This caused\nthe revenue shortfall. Rather: This tax policy caused the revenue shortfall.\nB. Use between when referring to two persons or things and among when referring to three\nor more persons or agencies.

            "text": "consensus is that your report is well written, that your facts are accurate, and that your\nconclusions are sound.)\nD. Lower case, Latin abbreviations require a period after each initial, but no space between\nthe period and the next letter. (For example: e.g. or that is: i.e.) Upper case (capital)\nletter abbreviations normally require no periods and no internal space (DPHHS, FWP,\nFM). Exceptions usually include geographic names (U.S.) and academic degrees (B.A.,\nM.S.)\nE. Who, Which, and That. Who and that are used when referring to persons. Select who\nwhen the individual person or the individuality of a group is meant and that when a class,\nspecies, or type is meant. (The Board of Land Commissioners determined that the\ncommissioner is the only one who can decide whether or not an EIS is required.\nReclamation policy is an issue that the administration has studied during the interim.)\nWhich and that are used when referring to places, objects, and animals. Which is always\nused to introduce nonessential clauses set off with commas; that is ordinarily used to\nintroduce essential clauses. (The department report on vacant positions, which was\npresented to the 2023 Legislature, was not used to develop the 2027 Biennium budget\nrecommendations. The pay plan report that was prepared by the Committee on State\nEmployee Compensation is funded in the executive budget.)\nF. Commas set off a dependent clause within a sentence and a nonessential clause within\na sentence. The following words/phrases always introduce nonessential clauses. \u201cAll of\nwhich, although, even though, though, for, no matter what, no matter how, none of which,\nnone of whom, some of whom, whereas.\u201d\nExample: The figures for FY 2026 include large cities only, whereas the data for the 2027\nBiennium includes rural areas as well.\nG. Do not use possessives ('s) with non-person nouns. For instance: Montana's roads; the\ncontract's terms. Rather: Montana roads; terms of the contract. Likewise, to form the\nplural of figures, add \u201cs\u201d not apostrophe s (\u2018s). Example: In the 1990s; temperatures in\nthe 90s.\nH. When independent clauses are linked by transitional expressions, use a semicolon\nbetween the clauses. Frequent transitions include: accordingly, consequently, for\nexample, furthermore, hence, however, moreover, namely, nevertheless, on the\ncontrary, otherwise, therefore, thus.\n13",

This includes adhering\nto Fiscal Notes Common Policies,6 which consist of cost standards related to FTE and certain\nexpenses. State departments are asked to document all calculations and assumptions used in\ntheir estimate, and provide a narrative explanation of their analysis. LCS works with departments\nto set deadlines for estimating impacts, and then considers that input when preparing the fiscal\nnote. Fiscal analysts also collect data from other sources and apply their own substantive\nknowledge of public programs to inform the analysis. Fiscal analysts provide an independent,\nnonpartisan evaluation of estimates made by state agencies, and accept, reject, or modify those\nestimates based on professional knowledge and judgement.\nDepartmental Differences\nThe estimate in the fiscal note is the product of LCS and can vary from the estimate provided by\ndepartments. Analysts work with departments to arrive at an agreed upon estimate; however,\nwhen no agreement can be reached, departments may request that a departmental difference\nbe included to document the agency\u2019s estimate, and the reason(s) it is not included in the fiscal\nnote.\n4 Demographic Notes: https://leg.colorado.gov/agencies/legislative-council-staff/demographic-notes\n5 Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reports: https://leg.colorado.gov/agencies/legislative-council-staff/greenhouse-gas-emissions-reports\n6 2025 Fiscal Notes Common Policies: https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/images/2025_fiscal_note_common_policies.pdf\nLegislative Council Staff \u2219 200 E.

The site visit and investigation are necessary to determine if a\nwaterway meets the new definition of navigable waterways. That could involve 8,000 currently permitted sites over a\nnumber of years.

The fiscal note is written to the introduced bill, with\ncertain limited exceptions. This initial fiscal note is typically provided to the sponsor 24 to 48\nhours prior to the committee meeting.\nFiscal Notes for Strike-below Amendments\nJoint Rule 22(b)(2)(A) and (B) allow the prime sponsor of a bill to request that LCS prepare a\nfiscal note for an amendment striking everything below the enacting clause (a SEBEC or strike-\nbelow amendment), in lieu of preparing a fiscal note on the introduced bill. The prime sponsor\nmust provide LCS with the amendment, and obtain written permission from the leadership of\nthe chamber in which the bill was introduced.\nRevised Fiscal Notes\nIf a bill is amended, LCS may revise the fiscal note for its next consideration, typically the\nAppropriations Committee. Fiscal notes may be revised multiple times as a bill moves through\nthe legislative process. Fiscal notes may also be updated to reflect new information or make\ntechnical corrections.\nFiscal Note Memos for Amendments\nTime permitting, LCS can assess the fiscal impact of amendments to bills and prepare a\nmemorandum. When an amendment removes the fiscal impact, a memorandum from LCS\npermits the committee to route a bill to second reading, instead of the Appropriations or\nFinance committees.\nFiscal Notes on Demand\nHouse Rule 32A (c) requires that LCS update or prepare a fiscal note on a bill prior to\nconsideration of the bill on second reading, if so requested by at least ten members of the\nHouse. Senate Rule 25 (e) requires that a fiscal note be prepared or updated before a bill can be\nconsidered on second reading, if requested by at least five members of the Senate.\nNN\nLegislative Council Staff - 200 E.

Show the increase in the table, and provide information about the decrease\nin the narrative.\nRefunds\nThe 10-year analysis needs to show how much people are paying for the new tax or fee.\nSometimes refunds are available, but do not subtract these from the gross estimate of the\nadditional amounts that paid as a result of the new tax or fee. Refunds are a separate transaction\nand are outside the realm of RCW 43.135.031. Discuss refunds in the narrative, however.\nNarrative Explanation\nA narrative explanation is required for all cash receipts estimates, indeterminate estimates, and\nno-cash-receipts estimates for the administering agency. It is not required for no-cash-receipts\nestimates for non-administering agencies.\nFirst, provide an explanation of what the bill does that makes it subject to RCW 43.135.031and\nindicate the section numbers that contain taxes or fees.\nSecond, describe and quantify the cash receipts impact of the legislation on your agency\u2014\nincluding rates, assumptions, and an explanation if the cash receipts are indeterminate.\nThe fiscal note narrative is a good starting point for this information, but may not be complete or\nsufficient on its own. Explain any significant changes in revenue that occur beyond the six year\nscope of the fiscal note. Remember, the fiscal note includes all revenue and some of the fiscal\nnote explanation may not be relevant to the 10-year analysis. Ensure that the narrative for the 10-\nyear analysis actually addresses the 10-year analysis revenue or cash receipts.\nNo Cash Receipts and Indeterminate\nWhen OFM has identified a bill as requiring a 10-year analysis, all agencies required to prepare a\nfiscal note will also be required to submit a 10-year cost analysis. While multiple agencies may\nhave responsibilities under the bill, only one agency might be responsible for collecting and\nadministering the tax or fee contained in the bill. For agencies with no cash receipts, the system\nprovides a check box to indicate \u201cNo Cash Receipts.\u201d If it is not obvious why your agency has\nno cash receipts resulting from the bill, provide an explanation.\nIf you cannot estimate the total amount of revenue that the state will receive from a proposed fee\nor tax by applying reasonable assumptions, include in the narrative portion the rates or the cost to\nthe individual tax or fee payer. For example, if the bill provides a new fee for a new license and\nsets the fee, but the agency cannot determine how many people will apply for the license, the\nnarrative should discuss the license cost in each of the ten years and any other known factors or\nreasonable assumptions.\nPlease make a concerted effort to estimate costs to fee or tax payers before making a 10-year\nanalysis as indeterminate; there should be very few 10-year analyses that have indeterminate\ncosts.\nOffice of Financial Management Page 58 of 61 January 2017",

            "text": "What is a \u201clegislative session\u201d?\nThe Legislature convenes in regular session the second Monday of each January. The\nConstitution provides for one 105-day regular session during odd-numbered years (January\nthrough mid-April) and one 60-day regular session during even-numbered years (January\nthrough mid-March) each biennium.\nA Legislature spans two years, one long session and one short session. Legislators introduce bills\nduring each session. Bill numbering starts in the long session and continues through the\nfollowing short session. Bills not enacted in the longer, odd-year session generally carry over to\nthe shorter, even-year session. Bills which carry over revert to their furthest process point in their\nhouse of origin.\nDo I automatically revise fiscal notes on carryover bills?\nIf a bill is introduced in a long session (odd-numbered year), but not enacted, the bill usually\ncarries over and is \u201calive\u201d in the short session the following year. Revenues and expenditures\nappearing in the first fiscal year (the year of the long session) would no longer apply, requiring a\nrevision of the fiscal note. Agencies should wait for an official request and not automatically\nrevise fiscal notes on carryover bills.\n2.5 OTHER FISCAL NOTE GUIDANCE\nPrepare early for the legislative session\nGenerally, each agency has an assigned fiscal note coordinator who is responsible for the internal\ncoordination of the fiscal note process. Prior to the start of any legislative session, become\nfamiliar with your agency\u2019s internal fiscal note process. Your agency fiscal note coordinator is a\ngood source of information and assistance in preparing for the upcoming session. Whether you\nare new to preparing fiscal notes or experience, it is helpful to view the fiscal note (and I-960)\ntraining that WaTech provides for agency staff. The Online FNS Training is posted on the OFM\nwebsite.\nTips to ensure a quality fiscal note:\n\u2022 Read the bill before you prepare your analysis.\n\u2022 Double-check your calculations and proof read the text.\n\u2022 Submit fiscal notes to OFM at least 24 hours before the scheduled hearing to allow\nadequate time for review and distribution.\n\u2022 Communicate with other agencies submitting fiscal notes on the same bill to avoid\ndifferent assumptions, double counting, or omissions.\n\u2022 Be clear in your methodology and assumptions, and show your work. Legislative and\nOFM analysts should be able to duplicate your work and arrive at the same bottom line\nnumbers provided in the note.\n\u2022 Total fiscal year expenditures by object must match total fiscal year expenditures by total\nfunds.\n\u2022 Include FTEs if expenditures for salaries and benefits are also included.\n\u2022 Remember to include benefit expenditures for salary expenditures.\nOffice of Financial Management Page 12 of 61 January 2017",

OFM asks agencies to develop 10-year cost analyses, which OFM then uses to formulate\nthe 10-year cost projection. OFM distributes the10-year cost projection via an email ListServ to\nevery Legislator, and members of the public and media who subscribe to the ListServ. The FNS\nsupports the request, preparation, review, and publication of the10-year analyses.

The final fiscal note also tells readers if the bill\u2019s\nappropriation is consistent with the analysis and estimate in the fiscal note.\nDistribution of Fiscal Notes\nFiscal analysts are in communication with bill sponsors throughout the writing process. Once a\nfiscal note is ready to publish, analysts will deliver fiscal notes to the sponsors before making the\nfiscal note public. Once the fiscal note is made public, it is distributed to legislators in their bill\nfolders and through iLegislate, and published online through the General Assembly's website.\nFiscal Notes and the Appropriations Process\nFiscal notes inform the budget-setting process. Each bill is assessed to identify the appropriation\nLCS believes is required to implement that bill, including any change in staffing levels. Once a\nbill is identified as requiring an appropriation (the authority to spend money), the committee of\nreference routes that bill to the Appropriations Committee for that body to determine the\nappropriation amount.\nPrior to that hearing, the Joint Budget Committee (JBC) staff provide a separate, independent\nreview the bill and the fiscal analysis prepared by LCS. Typically, the JBC analyst agrees with LCS\nand prepares an appropriation clause for the bill based on the information in the fiscal note. JBC\nstaff may also prepare an updated analysis as a result of changes made to the bill, or as a result\nof new information. In some cases, JBC staff may disagree with the LCS analysis and provide a\ndifferent analysis of the bill\u2019s fiscal impact. Legislators use the estimates made by LCS and JBC\nstaff to decide how much to appropriate for a bill.\nOther Fiscal Note Products\nIn addition to the regular fiscal notes process during legislative session, fiscal impacts are\nprepared for the different stages of citizen-initiated measures throughout the year and fiscal\nnotes are prepared for each bill draft requested by interim committees.\nLegislative Council Staff \u2219 200 E.

            "text": "SECTION 5\nBills that would increase taxes or fees\n5.1 PREPARING A 10-YEAR ANALYSIS\nRCW 43.135.031 (Initiative 960) requires that OFM determine the 10-year cost to tax and fee\npayers of any proposed legislation that would raise taxes, impose new fees, or increase current\nfees. OFM must communicate the most up-to-date 10-year cost projection to each member of the\nLegislature, the news media, and the public through email. OFM asks agencies to develop 10-\nyear cost analyses, which OFM then uses to formulate the 10-year cost projections. OFM uses\nthe FNS to request a 10-year analysis, usually in conjunction with a fiscal note request. The FNS\nsupports the request, preparation and review of 10-year analyses.\nIdentifying the need for a 10-year analysis\nOFM will review every bill and bill amendment introduced during the legislative session. It will\nrequest a 10-year cost analyses and, typically, a fiscal note on all bills or amended bills that\nwould create or raise taxes or fees.\nOnly OFM staff can request 10-year analyses. Agencies cannot submit unsolicited 10-year\nanalyses. If you believe that a bill contains a new or increased tax or fee, but OFM has not\nrequested a 10-year cost analysis, contact your OFM analyst before submitting the fiscal note\nand analysis.\nRefer to the OFM Implementation Criteria for Initiative 960 to learn more about how OFM\ndetermines whether a bill contains a new or increased tax or fee.\nPreparing the 10-year analysis\nThe FNS will include a notation on bills that require a 10-year analysis. OFM will also include\nspecial instructions for completing the analysis. The 10-year analysis should take precedence\nover all fiscal note requests.\nYou will prepare the 10-year cost analysis on a separate tab in FNS, pictured below. The format\nis similar to the table in Part 1 of the fiscal note section, but displays 10 years of cash receipt\nestimates. RCW 43.135.031 requires \"a year-by-year breakdown\u201d for each of the 10 years, which\nis more detail than required for fiscal notes.\nIn some cases, the estimates for the first six years on the 10-year analysis tab will match those in\nPart I on the fiscal note. However, not all cash receipts generated by a bill are taxes or fees for\nthe purposes of RCW 43.135.031. The 10-year analysis should only include cash receipts\nassociated with the tax or fee increase. For example, penalties and late charges are not\nconsidered fees under the law; therefore, the cash receipts associated with penalties or late fees\nshould not be included in the 10-year cost analysis. If you are not sure whether cash receipts\nfrom a bill are considered a new or increased tax or fee, contact your OFM analyst for\nclarification prior to preparing the 10-year analysis.\nOffice of Financial Management Page 55 of 61 January 2017",

Agencies are not\nrequired to estimate these impacts. When possible, though, agencies should identify the local\ngovernment units affected, and share this information with the Department of Commerce, the\nagency responsible for preparing local government fiscal notes, or with the Administrative\nOffice of the Courts, the agency responsible for preparing judicial fiscal notes.\nDoes the bill affect more than one agency?\nWhen a bill affects more than one agency, OFM will request each agency to prepare a fiscal note\nthat details the fiscal impact on its own operations (unless otherwise instructed). In order to\npresent a comprehensive picture of the legislation\u2019s fiscal impact, the system sends completed\nnotes to the Legislature as one package. OFM prepares a summary fiscal note identifying the\ncash receipt, expenditure, capital expenditures, and/or FTE impact to each agency affected by the\nlegislation. The local government and judicial impacts are also included, when applicable.\nWhat are the lead agency\u2019s responsibilities?\nThe lead agency develops a set of assumptions all agencies in a multi-agency fiscal note must\nfollow. Example assumptions include caseload, duration of impact and effect of bill language.\nTypically, OFM assigns the agency most affected by the legislation as the lead agency. The lead\nagency is responsible for coordinating the shared assumptions that form the basis of fiscal notes\nwritten by the various agencies.\nOFM encourages lead agencies to record their assumptions on the request tab in the FNS as soon\nas possible to benefit other agencies also working on notes. Agencies must communicate with\neach other to avoid conflicting assumptions, double counting, or omissions.\nWhy is it important for agencies to share assumptions?\nProblems can occur when agencies don\u2019t share assumption. Common errors include:\n\u2022 Overlapping fiscal information caused by more than one agency reporting the same\nrevenues or expenditures.\n\u2022 Missing costs for a new commission or advisory council created with the legislation.\n\u2022 Different workload numbers used by agencies affected by the bill.\n\u2022 Conflicting assumptions on staffing, rates or revenues.\nAny conflicting assumptions among individual fiscal notes will delay OFM distributing the\nfinal package to the Legislature. Late submittals from one or more of the contributing\nagencies also cause delays.\nOffice of Financial Management Page 9 of 61 January 2017",

There are four fiscal\nnote forms: General Fiscal Note, 5-Year Fiscal Note, Pension Fund Fiscal Note, and No\nImpact Fiscal Note.\nGeneral Fiscal Note \u2013 This fiscal note represents a four-year fiscal impact of the bill from\nFY2026 through FY 2029. This is most commonly used form.\n5-Year Fiscal Note \u2013 This form is used if there will be state fiscal impact in the year of the\nlegislative session, FY 2025. The only difference between the General Fiscal Note and the 5-\nYear is the additional year on the Fiscal Impact table.\nPension \u2013 This fiscal note form is used for fiscal notes for bills impacting the state\u2019s pension\nsystems. This template contains features that are specific to pension/retirement system\nlegislation and not to other types of bills.\nNo Impact - If the bill has no fiscal impact for your agency, use the \u201cNo Impact\u201d form.\nSomeone in reviewing the bill felt your agency might have fiscal impact related to the bill, so at\nthe very least you must explain why the bill does NOT have fiscal impact to your agency in the\n\u201cAssumptions\u201d tab before you can submit it to OBPP. In prior years, your agency was allowed\nto send an email saying there was no fiscal impact and that is not allowed in this system. Your\nagency will be required to complete the \u201cNo Impact\u201d form and submit it to OBPP through the\nOBPP Fiscal Notes database.\nSelect all of the checkboxes that apply to this agency fiscal note. Your fiscal note may include\na check for some, all, or none these.\nIf the fiscal impact of the bill was included in the Executive Budget or needs to be included in\nHB 2, check the appropriate boxes.\nIf you check the box indicating Significant Local Government Impact, Technical Concerns,\nand/or Significant Long-Term Impacts you will explain why your agency believes there will be\nsuch an impact on the \u201cOther Impacts\u201d tab. If you checked any of these boxes, you will not be\nable to validate without explaining why the checkbox is checked.\nThere are two additional checkboxes for forms that may need to be completed with your fiscal\nnote request: Dedicated Revenue and/or Statutory Appropriation. When you check the box on\nthis tab it will open an additional tab to be completed prior to submission to OBPP.\nDedicated Revenue \u2013 A fiscal note for any bill that proposes to dedicate a revenue or creates\na new state special revenue account must include and analysis of the proposed account.

The fiscal summary must describe the measure's fiscal impact,\nincluding a preliminary estimate of the measure\u2019s effect on state and local government\nrevenues, expenditures, taxes, and fiscal liabilities if implemented. It also includes a qualitative\ndescription of the economic impacts of the measure, and any other information from the\ninitiated measure or description of government implementation necessary to describe the fiscal\nand economic impacts. The fiscal summary must be included on the signature petitions\ncirculated by initiative proponents.\nFiscal Impact Statements\nIf the Title Board sets a title and the measure is approved to gather signatures, LCS prepares a\nfiscal impact statement on the measure, similar to the analysis provided for fiscal notes for bills.\nThe full fiscal impact statement must be completed within two weeks after a measure is\napproved to gather signatures, and must be posted on the General Assembly\u2019s website.7\nBlue Book Analyses\nLastly, LCS prepares fiscal impacts statements for all ballot measures as part of the Voter\nInformation Booklet (Blue Book) process, both for citizen-initiated measures and measures\nreferred by the General Assembly. These fiscal impact statements are summarized in the Blue\nBook for each measure, and the full fiscal impact statement is posted on the General Assembly\u2019s\nwebsite in both English and Spanish.\nFiscal Notes for Interim Committee Bills\nLegislative interim committees generally have the authority to recommend bills for introduction\nat the next regular session of the General Assembly.

Understand which sections apply to your\nagency and which sections create a fiscal impact for your agency.\nClearly communicate the results of your analysis\nThe fiscal note plays a key role in the legislative decision-making process. It is important for\nlegislators to understand why the bill costs money and what the key cost drivers are. Clearly\nindicate which portions of the bill create or drive costs and why, as well as how those costs are\ncalculated. The reader may not need to see every detailed calculation, but should be able to\nunderstand causes and elements of the estimated costs.\nIf the cost impact is indeterminate, provide some illustrative information or range of scenarios.\nAgencies must select the single fiscal estimate that reflects the most likely assumptions and\nscenario. If no one scenario is likely to occur, pick a number that represents the middle of the\nrange. Enter the fiscal estimate in the financial section of the note. Include an explanation that\nwill help the reader appreciate the factors that make it difficult to develop a reliable estimate.\nState and share your assumptions\nClearly explain the agencies\u2019 understanding of what the bill proposes, how the agency would\nimplement the proposal, and any other key cost-related assumptions upon which you based the\nanalysis. In other words, ensuring the reader understands the fiscal note helps maintain your\nagency\u2019s credibility.\nBase your assumptions on the least expensive way to reasonably implement the legislation. It is\npossible to use more than one set of assumptions, as long as they are reasonable, explicit, and not\nchosen to deliberately sway opinion on the bill.\nStarting point\nFiscal notes should note the incremental change from current budget or current law. The starting\npoint for a fiscal note should be the funding level that matches the current enacted budget or\ncurrent law. Fiscal notes should represent the incremental change from that baseline in each year.\nIf your agency is preparing a fiscal note on a bill assumed in the Governor\u2019s budget, prepare the\nfiscal note using the same cost assumed in the Governor\u2019s budget.\nDescribe the changes between bill versions\nFor fiscal notes prepared on subsequent bill versions, it is helpful to provide an explanation of\nthe changes made from one version of the legislation to the next. Place this explanation in Part II\nof the form, \u201cNarrative Explanation.\u201d This will help expedite OFM\u2019s review of subsequent fiscal\nnotes, as well as help legislators and legislative staff to understand and track the changes from\none version to the next.\nOffice of Financial Management Page 5 of 61 January 2017",

OFM designates a lead agency and\nassigns an OFM analyst to review the completed note. OFM then sends the request to the\nassigned agencies via FNS along with an email notification. The request information is\nimmediately available in the system, which includes a link to the bill or draft language.\nEach assigned agency prepares a fiscal note for its agency. The Local Government Fiscal Note\nProgram within the Department of Commerce prepares Local government fiscal notes. The\nOffice of the Administrator for the Courts prepares Judicial impact fiscal notes. OFM or an\nexisting agency with relevant knowledge prepares fiscal impact notes on legislation that has\nbroad statewide impact or creates a new agency.\nThe lead agency is responsible for coordinating shared assumptions that underlie fiscal notes\nprepared by various agencies on the same bill or proposal. This may involve all the affected\nagencies getting together to discuss the bill and the assumptions. As soon as possible, the lead\nagency should record its assumptions in the FNS on the Request tab. This allows other agencies\ninvolved to quickly access the assumptions.\nAfter the agency approves a note internally, the agency releases and transmits the note to OFM\nfor review. The FNS supports the preparation, review, approval and transmittal steps.\nIn most cases, legislative staff requests a fiscal note to ensure that fiscal impact information is\navailable when a bill is considered in committee. This means that the fiscal note is needed by\nthe Legislature at least 24 hours before the scheduled hearing. OFM assigns a due date\naccordingly \u2014 generally 72 hours, or three days, in advance, to cover contingencies. Local\ngovernment fiscal notes are usually assigned a due date that is seven calendar days from the date\nof the request. It may be helpful for preparers to realize that far more bills are heard than are\nactually voted out of committee.\nAttentiveness to hearing dates is important, especially if the hearing occurs prior to the due\ndate assigned by OFM. The FNS indicates the next scheduled hearing date associated with each\nrequest to assist all parties in meeting what are often quick turnaround requirements.\nOFM reviews fiscal notes for approved format, accuracy, reasonableness, and completeness\nbefore distributing the note to the Legislature. The assigned OFM budget analyst may contact an\nagency with questions or request a revised note.\nA fiscal note is not official and final until OFM distributes it.\nOffice of Financial Management Page 3 of 61 January 2017",

(\u201cPresiding\nofficer\u201d is defined pursuant to NRS 218D.400 as the Speaker of the Assembly, the Senate\nMajority Leader, or another legislator who is performing those duties during the absence or\ninability of the Speaker or the Majority Leader.)\nFiscal Notes Requested by Legislators\nNRS 218D.445 provides that a legislator may at any time while the bill is before his or her house\nraise the issue that a fiscal note is required on a bill. The Fiscal Analysis Division will request a\nfiscal note when the presiding officer of the house so instructs.\n4",

They rarely describe the source of revenue. \u201cLicense Fee\u201d\ndoes not provide adequate information about what the fee is for, but \u201cInsurance Provider and\nBroker License Fee\u201d does. Use a descriptive title.\nWith one exception, if a tax or fee is deposited into multiple accounts, use the exact same tax or\nfee title for each account. While OFM wants to know into what accounts taxes and fees are\ndeposited, the law does not require that accounts be identified and the revenue will be combined\nfor purposes of the notice. Using the exact same tax or fee title allows this combination to\nhappen automatically. See the Netting of Increases and Decreases instructions for the exception\nto this rule.\nAccount Codes\nAll account codes must be three characters. Enter new accounts as \u201cNEW\u201d in the space for\nAccount Code. If there is more than one new account created, identify each account as N01,\nN02, etc. At this time, the system will not allow users to enter anything other than an existing\naccount code or NEW, N01, N02, etc.\nNetting of Increases and Decreases\nSome bills contain both an increase and decrease. You may not net fee increases and decreases\nagainst each other. Only the increase should appear in the grid, but discuss the decrease and the\namount of the decrease in the comments section.\nYou can net taxes in certain circumstances:\nIf the tax being raised and the tax being lowered are deposited into the same fund or\naccount and the net effect is negative or zero, then RCW 43.135.031 does not apply since\nthe state law defines \u201craises taxes\u201d to mean actions by the legislature that increase state\nrevenue deposited in any fund or account. If OFM requested a 10-year analysis, please\ncontact us to discuss this before you submit the fiscal note and 10-year analysis.\nIf the tax being raised and the tax being lowered are deposited into the same fund or\naccount and the net effect is positive, RCW 43.135.031 does apply. Show the increases\nand decreases on separate lines in the 10-year table, even if the increases and decreases\nare for the same tax. You will need to identify the components separately within the tax\ntitles when different components of the same tax are increased and decreased. This will\nensure that the system does not combine the increases and decreases in the notice. This is\na change from previous years when agencies could combine positives and negatives\nwithin the same account and for the same tax. This is also an exception to the rule of\nusing the exact same tax title when revenue is deposited into more than one account.\nPositive and negative changes to different components of, for example, the B&O tax,\nnow must display separately.\nOffice of Financial Management Page 57 of 61 January 2017",

HF3-0 requires that MMB track all audit recommendations and provide a report on\nimplementation status of recommendations annually. Financial audit reports have not historically been tracked at the\nrecommendation level but at the findings level. MMB will need to collaborate with agencies to collect the additional\nrequired information. MMB currently dedicates between 0.50 and 0.75 full-time equivalent (FTE) to support this work.\nImplementation of HF3-0 will require additional staff support estimated to be at 0.25 FTE annually bringing total effort to\n0.75-1.0 FTE.\nWork related to tracking is assigned to Internal Control and Audit Division within MMB. This division has five positions that\ndivide the work. Average projected cost of an FTE in this division is $138,794 and $141,649 for fiscal years 2026 and\n2027, respectively. Cost for fiscal years 2028 and 2029 will be the same as calculated for fiscal year 2027.\nEmployee overhead costs are assumed to be 17.17 percent of total salary and fringe costs. Overhead includes costs such\nas space, laptops and employee technology, phone, supplies, printing, training, and travel. This percentage represents the\naverage percent of MMB's total general fund operating budget spent on non-payroll employee overhead costs in the\nprevious biennium.\nMMB assumes implementation date of July 1, 2025.\nExpenditure and/or Revenue Formula\nFY 2026: $138,794 (Average Salary) * 0.25 (FTE) * 1.1717 (Overhead)= $40,656\nFY 2027: $141,649 (Average Salary) * 0.25 (FTE) * 1.1717 (Overhead) = $41,493",

The note must be obtained\nbefore a committee of either house can vote on the bill.\nA fiscal note is not required if the only impact on a local government is that a bill creates a new\nmisdemeanor or gross misdemeanor or increases the penalty for an existing misdemeanor or\ngross misdemeanor.\nHow the Need for a Fiscal Note is Determined\nNRS 218D.415 requires the Legal Division of the LCB to include a statement of fiscal impact in\nthe summary of each bill. When necessary, the Legislative Counsel consults with the Fiscal\nAnalysis Division to determine the appropriate notation. The possible statements of fiscal\nimpact are as follows:\nEffect on State Government: Yes;\nNo;\nExecutive Budget;\nContains Appropriation included in the Executive Budget; or\nContains Appropriation not included in the Executive Budget\nEffect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact;\nNo;\nIncreases or Newly Provides for Term of Imprisonment in\nCounty or City Jail or Detention Facility\nIf the notation on the bill is \u201cNo,\u201d \u201cExecutive Budget, \u201dor \u201cContains Appropriation included in the\nExecutive Budget,\u201d a fiscal note is not required. If the notation on the bill is \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cMay have\nFiscal Impact,\u201d a fiscal note is required. If the notation on the bill is \u201cContains Appropriation Not\nIncluded in the Executive Budget,\u201d the Fiscal Analysis Division determines whether obtaining a\nfiscal note would be beneficial.\nHow Fiscal Notes are Obtained and Printed\nThe Fiscal Analysis Division receives copies of the bills that the Legal Division has determined\nhave a fiscal impact or contain an appropriation not included in The Executive Budget. The\nFiscal Analysis Division determines which agencies would have a qualifying fiscal impact as a\nresult of the measure and sends an electronic request for a fiscal note to those agencies.\nIf a legislator has requested a BDR, the Fiscal Analysis Division informs the legislator that a\nfiscal note is required and requests permission to begin preparing a fiscal note. If the legislator\ndoes not grant permission, the preparation of the fiscal note is started automatically upon\n3",

Thus, agencies have some added assurance of data\nintegrity.\n\u2022 A PDF file has no documented virus problems.\nIf you plan to attach documents to the fiscal note in the system, you will need to have Adobe\nAcrobat software available. This software will enable you to convert files to the PDF format.\nExcel and Word include options for saving a file as a PDF. For both programs, there is typically\na \u201cSave as Adobe PDF\u201d option in the File tab. We recommend that you contact your information\ntechnology support staff if you need further assistance creating PDF files.\nAt the Console, click on the Modify Fiscal Note icon . This will take you to the Fiscal Note\nscreen. You can attach PDF files on the Agency Info tab.\nOffice of Financial Management Page 37 of 61 January 2017",

            "text": "Who determines the need for a fiscal note?\nThe Legislative Services Division (LSD), the standing committee, the sponsor, or a majority of\nthe members of the house in which a bill is to be considered, may request, through the presiding\nofficer, that a fiscal note be prepared. A standing committee considering a bill and requesting a\nfiscal note will hold the bill until the fiscal note is complete. An agency may also advise OBPP\nthat a fiscal note is needed.\nPreparing Fiscal Notes\n1. Agencies are notified of the fiscal note request\nOBPP will notify agencies that a fiscal note is to be prepared by sending an email to the primary\nagency contacts via the OBPP Fiscal Notes Database. An agency should have at least two\nprimary contacts in the system to receive these notices. When the first contact in an agency\nopens the file in the database, a notice will be sent to OBPP that the agency has received the\nnotification to prepare a fiscal note. This notification must be received by OBPP within two hours\nof the message being sent or by 10:00 am the following day, if the notice from OBPP occurred\nafter 4:00 pm. If OBPP does not receive a notification within two hours, the database will send\na notification reminder and the OBPP executive assistant will call the agency contact to assure\nthe agency has received the notification.\nIf a fiscal note is requested from more than one agency for response, all agencies must submit\na draft fiscal note to reflect the anticipated effects on the agency. An agency will ONLY write\nthe fiscal note for impact to the specific agency as reflected in the bill.\nThe Department of Revenue will be assigned most estimates of proposed taxation legislation.\nThe agency affected by the expenditure will prepare expenditure estimates, and the agency\nmost knowledgeable of revenue will prepare the revenue estimates. The OBPP prepares a\nsingle and official fiscal note on the basis of the estimates provided.\n2. Read the bill\nThe most important step in developing a fiscal note is having a clear understanding of the bill.\nThe bill should be thoroughly understood before beginning preparation of a fiscal note. Read,\nreread, and discuss the bill until the changes from current law are clear. Equipped with this\nknowledge, and possibly some notes, drafting can begin.\nYou can click on the Bill Landing Page icon at the top left of the screen to\ngo to Bill Explorer to the bill. You can also go directly to Bill Explorer https://bills.legmt.gov/\nwithout going into the OBPP Fiscal Notes database. Be certain the version of the bill you use to\nprepare the fiscal note is the same as the version for which the fiscal note is requested.\n3. Select the \u201cMy Tasks\u201d tab in the OBPP Fiscal Notes database\nClick the edit icon on the left side of the line on which the bill you want to work on is listed.\n2",

It\nalso outlines required information on the bill and its fiscal impacts that must be include in fiscal\nnotes and the distribution of fiscal notes to committees. House Rule 32A and Senate Rule 25 (e)\nprovide additional guidance on chamber-specific procedures related to fiscal notes, including\nrequirements that a fiscal note be prepared prior to voting on bills at certain stages and a\nprocess for legislators to request an updated fiscal note, among other things.2,3\nConfidentiality\nIn order to meet the deadlines of legislative session, fiscal analysts have access to confidential\nbill drafts prior to a bill being introduced, but are legally obligated to keep that information\nconfidential, just like the attorney drafting the bill. Joint legislative rules and state law permit the\nOffice of Legislative Legal Services (OLLS) to provide preliminary copies of bills to LCS so that\nfiscal staff can commence their review and analysis, including sharing the bill with affected\nagencies with the sponsor\u2019s permission.

A fiscal note\u2019s primary\npurpose is to provide the most reasonable estimate of the expenditure and cash receipt\nimplications of proposed legislation using the best and most rationale set of assumptions. There\nare three types of fiscal notes; state, local and judicial. The majority of fiscal note requests come\nfrom legislative staff and OFM agency staff may also request fiscal notes subject to OFM\u2019s\napproval.\nLegislators, legislative staff, OFM, and agency staff, journalists, lobbyists, and citizens who\nparticipate in the legislative process use fiscal notes. Used primarily during the legislative\nsession, fiscal notes help determine the direction and funding level of proposed changes at all\nlevels. They are also used after the legislative session ends for research, financial analyses, and\nto develop future budget requests.\n1.2 WHAT IS THE ROLE OF THE OFFICE OF FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT?\nChapter 43.88A RCW requires that OFM coordinate the development of fiscal impact statements\n(fiscal notes), approve them for form, accuracy and completeness, and distribute them. OFM's\nobjective is to distribute a complete package of fiscal notes in time for scheduled legislative\nhearings. This is too focused on the hearing as a trigger \u201cas soon as is reasonable and no later\nthan scheduled legislative hearings.\u201d\n1.3 WHAT IS THE ROLE OF AGENCIES?\nAs subject matter experts, agencies prepare fiscal notes to estimate the cost of implementing\nlegislative proposals on affected programs. Explaining the costs requires identifying and\npresenting workload drivers and the most reasonable implementation scenario. Fiscal notes must\nbe factual and objective, and share assumptions with other agencies that also prepare fiscal notes\non the same legislation. Assumptions used by multiple agencies to prepare a fiscal note on the\nsame bill must be consistent and fit into one cohesive package.\n1.4 WHAT IS THE FISCAL NOTE PROCESS?\nThe Legislature, OFM or an agency initiates a fiscal note request through the Fiscal Note System\n(FNS). The fiscal note request must specify:\n\u2022 The bill, initiative, draft bill, or amendment to be analyzed.\nOffice of Financial Management Page 2 of 61 January 2017",

Statutory provisions regarding fiscal\nnotes may be found in 5-4-201 through 5-4-210, MCA.\nWhat is the total processing time of a fiscal note?\nFiscal notes follow a statutory six-day processing time-period and 24-hour period for sponsor\nreview. The process consists of:\nDAY 1 The presiding officer of either house sends a fiscal note request to OBPP.\nOBPP determines affected agencies and notifies agencies of the fiscal note\nrequest.\nDAYS 2-4 Agencies draft a fiscal note and returned it to OBPP by noon on day 4.\nDAYS 4-5 The appropriate OBPP analyst(s) review and compile the fiscal note to be\napproved by the Budget Director.\nDAY 6 OBPP analyst passes the fiscal note to OBPP management for review, then it\npasses to the budget director for final review, signature, and transmittal to the\noriginating house.\nThe bill sponsor has 24 hours to review the fiscal note and sign, not sign, or rebut.\nThe fiscal note transmitted to the originating house provides the official version of the fiscal\nimpact for the version of the bill on which it was prepared. The fiscal note is not complete until\nthe sponsor has responded, and it is posted on Bill Explorer.\nOBPP has committed to have fiscal notes available for the Legislature on the first day of session\nfor those bills where the fiscal note request was received at least six working days prior to the\nbeginning of session. This may mean a little more work in December, but less in January.\nWhat if the sponsor disagrees with the fiscal note?\nIf the sponsor disagrees with the fiscal note they have three options:\n1. Disagree and not sign the fiscal note, and it will be printed and distributed without the\nsponsor\u2019s signature;\n2. Meet with OBPP and the agency to discuss the fiscal note and determine if any revisions\nare necessary; or\n3. Prepare and submit a sponsor\u2019s fiscal note rebuttal form provided by the Legislative\nServices Division, to be completed within four days and presented to the presiding officer.\nIt will be printed and distributed with the official fiscal note.\nIf the sponsor requests additional time to consult with the budget director, the presiding officer\nnotifies the sponsor and the budget director of the additional allotted time, not to extend beyond\n24 hours.\nWho requests fiscal notes?\nThe President of the Senate or the Speaker of the House officially request fiscal notes from the\nOffice of Budget and Program Planning.\n1",

You will receive a new request that\nindicates the new bill description, for example substitute or engrossed, or date of the amendment\nalong with the committee and house amending the bill. The FNS makes it easy to use a previous\nfiscal note as the basis for a new fiscal note.\nA fiscal note request for a subsequent version of a bill does not negate the need to proceed with\nthe original requested version. Fiscal note requests are considered active unless\nwithdrawn/canceled by the original requester.\nAm I still required to complete the fiscal note if the bill didn\u2019t pass the cutoff?\nSometimes you may have a request for a fiscal note on a bill that does not make it past a\nparticular cutoff date. OFM cannot withdraw a request for a fiscal note made by a legislator or\nlegislative staff member. We recommend that the agency establish that the bill is really \"dead,\"\nwith no chance of being added to another bill or be a \"title only\" bill, then prioritize completion\nof the fiscal note with other requests on bills that have met cutoff dates. Until all individuals\nrequesting the fiscal note cancel their requests, OFM expects agencies to submit completed fiscal\nnotes.\nWhat if the bill language is vague?\nIf a bill is so vague that the intent cannot be determined, contact OFM and the legislative contact\nperson immediately. Identify both the language and factors that create the problem. The\nlegislative contact person may be able to provide sufficient, additional information that allows\nyou to make some assumptions. If, after this contact, you are still unable to prepare a valid fiscal\nnote, check the \"Indeterminate Cash Receipts\" and/or \"Indeterminate Expenditure Impact\" boxes\nand use the narrative portions in those sections to specify the factors that prevent you from\npreparing an adequate fiscal note.\nKeep in mind that in order to release a fiscal note marked \u201cindeterminate,\u201d you must make a\nfiscal impact selection of \u201cless than $50,000\u201d or \u201c$50,000 or greater.\u201d\nOffice of Financial Management Page 10 of 61 January 2017",

Fiscal notes provide\na substantive summary of each bill, describe how the proposal changes current law, and\nestimate the change in state funding and staff needed to implement that change. Every bill and\nconcurrent resolution is assessed by LCS and receives a published fiscal note for the first\ncommittee of reference. Fiscal notes are updated as bills more through the legislative process. A\nbill\u2019s fiscal note reflects the official estimates of LCS at a given point in the legislative process,\nand may be revised as the bill is amended or new information is received. The legislature\ndecides whether and how to use the information provided in the fiscal note.\nHistory of Fiscal Notes\nPrior to 1989, the executive branch provided estimates to the General Assembly on the impacts\nof proposed legislation. House Bill 88-1329 created the fiscal note process so that the General\nAssembly could receive an independent, nonpartisan assessment of legislation from legislative\nstaff, rather than affected agencies. House Joint Resolution 89-1003 was adopted to create the\nnecessary legislative rules and to designate LCS as the legislative service agency responsible for\npreparing fiscal notes. Fiscal notes have been prepared for all proposed legislation since 1989.",

            "text": "2.4 ANSWERS TO COMMON QUESTIONS ABOUT FISCAL NOTES\nWhat if my agency needs to revise a fiscal note?\nThe OFM budget analyst may request that an agency revise its fiscal note before OFM approval.\nIn this case, the agency should revise the fiscal note, check the \"Revised\" box, found on the\nSummary tab in the FNS, and retransmit the note to OFM.\nOnce your agency releases a fiscal note to OFM, it can no longer modify that version of the note.\nYou must create a new version. See Section 4.4 on how to prepare a revised fiscal note.\nMay agencies prepare a fiscal note without a request (an unsolicited fiscal note)?\nPrior to the legislative session your agency should prepare fiscal impact statements for agency\nrequest legislation that has a fiscal impact or that may create a fiscal impact for other agencies.\nDuring this time (prior to the legislative session), there are no restrictions in the system that\nwould prevent your agency from preparing a fiscal note.\nDuring the legislative session the FNS will not allow agencies to prepare an unsolicited fiscal\nnote. An agency may only prepare a note if OFM adds it to a request. If you are aware of an\nintroduced bill that has a fiscal impact on your agency, but you have not received a fiscal note\nrequest for the bill, you must use the \u201ccreate unsolicited fiscal note request\u201d feature in FNS to\nrequest that OFM add your agency to the request. You should limit unsolicited fiscal note\nrequests to bills with significant fiscal impact scheduled for a public hearing. See Section 4.8 for\ninstructions on using this feature in FNS. OFM reviews all unsolicited fiscal note requests prior\nto assignments.\nIf your agency identifies a bill the Legislature passed that has a fiscal impact on your agency, it\ncan be helpful to prepare an unsolicited fiscal note. This will assist OFM staff during review of\nenrolled bills. Use the \u201crequest an unsolicited fiscal note request\u201d feature to have your agency\nadded to an existing request.\nWhat if it is just not possible to complete the note by the hearing or due date?\nA fiscal note is most valuable when it is available in time for the legislative hearing on the\nunderlying bill. Sometimes a bill is so lengthy or detailed that an agency cannot provide\nreasonable estimates in the allotted time. If you are unable to prepare a fiscal note by the bill\u2019s\nhearing date, please contact the legislative staff contact person directly. Indicate why you need\nadditional time and when you will submit the completed fiscal note. Also, notify your assigned\nOFM budget analyst.\nHow is a fiscal note canceled?\nOnly the fiscal note requester can cancel a request. Requests remain in effect until all co-\nrequesters cancel their requests. When a requester cancels a fiscal note, the system sends an\nemail notification to the agency. The request remains listed on the Console screen, but the\nsystem lists the status as \"Canceled.\"\nOffice of Financial Management Page 11 of 61 January 2017",

Funds will only be used to reimburse travel costs and allowed state per diem for\nmembers of the Council. Based on historical expenses encountered with similar Councils administered\nby the Department with membership from throughout the state, the average travel and per diem cost per\nmember to attend the meetings is approximately $250.00 per person.

The bill\nwould allow DHCA to adopt rules to govern the implementation and administration of the pilot program,\nincluding establishing a separate fund at the department to receive and disburse funds.\nMethodology\nBased on information provided by DHCA, this analysis assumes that the duties and responsibilities associated\nwith implementing the provisions of the bill would require 1.0 FTE (Program Specialist) in fiscal years 2022-\n2026, and 0.3 FTE (Auditor) in fiscal years 2024-2026, including personnel costs, agency payroll contribution,\nand equipment.

When an amendment removes the fiscal impact, a memorandum from LCS\npermits the committee to route a bill to second reading, instead of the Appropriations or\nFinance committees.\nFiscal Notes on Demand\nHouse Rule 32A (c) requires that LCS update or prepare a fiscal note on a bill prior to\nconsideration of the bill on second reading, if so requested by at least ten members of the\nHouse. Senate Rule 25 (e) requires that a fiscal note be prepared or updated before a bill can be\nconsidered on second reading, if requested by at least five members of the Senate.\nNN\nLegislative Council Staff - 200 E.

It is not required for no-cash-receipts\nestimates for non-administering agencies.\nFirst, provide an explanation of what the bill does that makes it subject to RCW 43.135.031and\nindicate the section numbers that contain taxes or fees.\nSecond, describe and quantify the cash receipts impact of the legislation on your agency\u2014\nincluding rates, assumptions, and an explanation if the cash receipts are indeterminate.\nThe fiscal note narrative is a good starting point for this information, but may not be complete or\nsufficient on its own.

Remember, the fiscal note includes all revenue and some of the fiscal\nnote explanation may not be relevant to the 10-year analysis. Ensure that the narrative for the 10-\nyear analysis actually addresses the 10-year analysis revenue or cash receipts.\nNo Cash Receipts and Indeterminate\nWhen OFM has identified a bill as requiring a 10-year analysis, all agencies required to prepare a\nfiscal note will also be required to submit a 10-year cost analysis. While multiple agencies may\nhave responsibilities under the bill, only one agency might be responsible for collecting and\nadministering the tax or fee contained in the bill. For agencies with no cash receipts, the system\nprovides a check box to indicate \u201cNo Cash Receipts.\u201d If it is not obvious why your agency has\nno cash receipts resulting from the bill, provide an explanation.\nIf you cannot estimate the total amount of revenue that the state will receive from a proposed fee\nor tax by applying reasonable assumptions, include in the narrative portion the rates or the cost to\nthe individual tax or fee payer. For example, if the bill provides a new fee for a new license and\nsets the fee, but the agency cannot determine how many people will apply for the license, the\nnarrative should discuss the license cost in each of the ten years and any other known factors or\nreasonable assumptions.\nPlease make a concerted effort to estimate costs to fee or tax payers before making a 10-year\nanalysis as indeterminate; there should be very few 10-year analyses that have indeterminate\ncosts.\nOffice of Financial Management Page 58 of 61 January 2017",

Show the increase in the table, and provide information about the decrease\nin the narrative.\nRefunds\nThe 10-year analysis needs to show how much people are paying for the new tax or fee.\nSometimes refunds are available, but do not subtract these from the gross estimate of the\nadditional amounts that paid as a result of the new tax or fee. Refunds are a separate transaction\nand are outside the realm of RCW 43.135.031. Discuss refunds in the narrative, however.\nNarrative Explanation\nA narrative explanation is required for all cash receipts estimates, indeterminate estimates, and\nno-cash-receipts estimates for the administering agency. It is not required for no-cash-receipts\nestimates for non-administering agencies.\nFirst, provide an explanation of what the bill does that makes it subject to RCW 43.135.031and\nindicate the section numbers that contain taxes or fees.\nSecond, describe and quantify the cash receipts impact of the legislation on your agency\u2014\nincluding rates, assumptions, and an explanation if the cash receipts are indeterminate.\nThe fiscal note narrative is a good starting point for this information, but may not be complete or\nsufficient on its own.

          "text": "Be objective and factual\nThe primary purpose of a fiscal note is to provide the best possible estimate of the expenditure\nand cash receipt impacts of proposed legislation. It should be factual, informative, concise, and\nas objective as possible.\nRespond to the bill language\nA fiscal note should focus on the cost implication of only one bill, without considering the\npotential impact of other bills, or speculation beyond language actually contained in the\nproposal.\nDo not discuss bill merits\nComments or opinions relative to the merits of a bill are not appropriate in a fiscal note. Such\ncomments should be made through other means, including testimony, meetings, or letters to\nlegislators.\nAvoid jargon\nWrite the fiscal note\u2019s narrative for a general audience. Be as clear as possible and avoid overuse\nof jargon and acronyms. When using an acronym for the first time, spell it out, as is the\ncustomary practice, for example the \u201cOffice of Financial Management (OFM).\u201d\nDo not use inflation\nState the expenditure impact in current dollars for the entire period covered by the fiscal note. Do\nnot use an inflation factor to increase expenditures in future years. If there are valid workload\nchanges in future years, these costs are appropriate to include.\nKeep working papers handy\nWe advise agencies to maintain all agency work sheets and data used to prepare fiscal notes for\nat least two years following the applicable legislative session.\n2.2 ANSWERS TO COMMON QUESTIONS ABOUT FISCAL IMPACT AND FUNDING\nDoes there appear to be no fiscal impact to the legislation?\nIf the proposed legislation has no fiscal impact, check the \"no fiscal impact\" box (found on the\nSummary tab in the FNS). Provide a brief explanation of this assumption in the brief description\nnarrative box.\nOFM will not withdraw a request unless asked to do so by the original legislative requester. You\nshould complete and submit an appropriate fiscal note unless the request is withdrawn. If there is\nno fiscal impact, check the \u201cno fiscal impact\u201d box.\nOffice of Financial Management Page 6 of 61 January 2017",

(\u201cPresiding\nofficer\u201d is defined pursuant to NRS 218D.400 as the Speaker of the Assembly, the Senate\nMajority Leader, or another legislator who is performing those duties during the absence or\ninability of the Speaker or the Majority Leader.)\nFiscal Notes Requested by Legislators\nNRS 218D.445 provides that a legislator may at any time while the bill is before his or her house\nraise the issue that a fiscal note is required on a bill. The Fiscal Analysis Division will request a\nfiscal note when the presiding officer of the house so instructs.\n4",

It\nalso outlines required information on the bill and its fiscal impacts that must be include in fiscal\nnotes and the distribution of fiscal notes to committees.

A fiscal note\u2019s primary\npurpose is to provide the most reasonable estimate of the expenditure and cash receipt\nimplications of proposed legislation using the best and most rationale set of assumptions. There\nare three types of fiscal notes; state, local and judicial. The majority of fiscal note requests come\nfrom legislative staff and OFM agency staff may also request fiscal notes subject to OFM\u2019s\napproval.\nLegislators, legislative staff, OFM, and agency staff, journalists, lobbyists, and citizens who\nparticipate in the legislative process use fiscal notes. Used primarily during the legislative\nsession, fiscal notes help determine the direction and funding level of proposed changes at all\nlevels. They are also used after the legislative session ends for research, financial analyses, and\nto develop future budget requests.\n1.2 WHAT IS THE ROLE OF THE OFFICE OF FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT?\nChapter 43.88A RCW requires that OFM coordinate the development of fiscal impact statements\n(fiscal notes), approve them for form, accuracy and completeness, and distribute them. OFM's\nobjective is to distribute a complete package of fiscal notes in time for scheduled legislative\nhearings. This is too focused on the hearing as a trigger \u201cas soon as is reasonable and no later\nthan scheduled legislative hearings.\u201d\n1.3 WHAT IS THE ROLE OF AGENCIES?\nAs subject matter experts, agencies prepare fiscal notes to estimate the cost of implementing\nlegislative proposals on affected programs. Explaining the costs requires identifying and\npresenting workload drivers and the most reasonable implementation scenario. Fiscal notes must\nbe factual and objective, and share assumptions with other agencies that also prepare fiscal notes\non the same legislation. Assumptions used by multiple agencies to prepare a fiscal note on the\nsame bill must be consistent and fit into one cohesive package.\n1.4 WHAT IS THE FISCAL NOTE PROCESS?\nThe Legislature, OFM or an agency initiates a fiscal note request through the Fiscal Note System\n(FNS).

OFM cannot withdraw a request for a fiscal note made by a legislator or\nlegislative staff member. We recommend that the agency establish that the bill is really \"dead,\"\nwith no chance of being added to another bill or be a \"title only\" bill, then prioritize completion\nof the fiscal note with other requests on bills that have met cutoff dates. Until all individuals\nrequesting the fiscal note cancel their requests, OFM expects agencies to submit completed fiscal\nnotes.\nWhat if the bill language is vague?\nIf a bill is so vague that the intent cannot be determined, contact OFM and the legislative contact\nperson immediately. Identify both the language and factors that create the problem. The\nlegislative contact person may be able to provide sufficient, additional information that allows\nyou to make some assumptions. If, after this contact, you are still unable to prepare a valid fiscal\nnote, check the \"Indeterminate Cash Receipts\" and/or \"Indeterminate Expenditure Impact\" boxes\nand use the narrative portions in those sections to specify the factors that prevent you from\npreparing an adequate fiscal note.\nKeep in mind that in order to release a fiscal note marked \u201cindeterminate,\u201d you must make a\nfiscal impact selection of \u201cless than $50,000\u201d or \u201c$50,000 or greater.\u201d\nOffice of Financial Management Page 10 of 61 January 2017",

  "final_answer": "The provided budget documents list numerous education-related budget items under the umbrella of HB300, primarily managed by the Department of Education.  However, the level of detail is limited, making it difficult to generate comprehensive fiscal notes.  Many entries lack crucial information such as specific dollar amounts, program descriptions, and intended outcomes.\n\nBased on the available budget documents, we can identify several categories of education spending and attempt to create preliminary fiscal notes.  These notes are incomplete due to the lack of quantitative data in the source material.\n\n**Preliminary Fiscal Notes (Incomplete due to data limitations):**\n\n**1. School Support (EDN400):**  Multiple budget documents mention funding for school support under EDN400 within HB300.  Funding sources include general funds, other federal funds, and private contributions.\n\n* **Fiscal Note:**  This budget item allocates funds for general school support activities.  The exact amount and allocation across different support areas (e.g., infrastructure, supplies, staff) are unavailable.  Funding sources are diverse, including state general funds, federal grants, and private donations.  Further detail is needed to assess the impact and effectiveness of this funding.\n\n**2. Early Learning (EDN700):**  Funding for early learning programs is also listed under HB300, with funding sources including general funds, other federal funds, and special funds.\n\n* **Fiscal Note:**  This budget item provides funding for early childhood education programs.  The specific programs funded and the amount allocated to each are unknown.  Funding comes from a mix of state and federal sources, as well as potentially special funds.  A detailed breakdown of expenditures and program outcomes is required for a complete fiscal analysis.\n\n**3. Instructional Support (EDN200):**  Instructional support receives funding from general funds and other federal funds.\n\n* **Fiscal Note:** This budget item supports instructional activities in schools.  The specific uses of these funds (e.g., teacher training, curriculum development, instructional materials) are not specified.  Funding sources include state general funds and federal grants.  A more detailed breakdown is needed to assess the impact on student learning.\n\n**4. Charter Schools (EDN600):**  Funding for charter schools is mentioned, with general and federal funds identified as sources.\n\n* **Fiscal Note:** This budget item provides funding for charter school operations.  The specific allocation to individual charter schools and the criteria for funding are not provided.  Funding sources include state general funds and federal grants.  Further information is needed to assess the fiscal impact and effectiveness of this funding.\n\n**5. State Administration (EDN300):**  The state administration of education receives funding, with general and other federal funds listed.\n\n* **Fiscal Note:** This budget item covers the administrative costs of the Department of Education.  The specific allocation for different administrative functions is not detailed.  Funding sources include state general funds and federal grants.  A detailed breakdown of administrative expenses is needed for a complete fiscal analysis.\n\n\n**Limitations:**  The provided budget documents lack crucial information, such as specific dollar amounts for each budget item, detailed program descriptions, and performance metrics.  This significantly limits the ability to create comprehensive and informative fiscal notes.  Without this information, these fiscal notes remain preliminary and incomplete.  Further data is needed for a thorough fiscal analysis.",

    "Search completed: Found 565 relevant documents",
    "The provided budget documents list numerous education-related budget items under the umbrella of HB300, primarily managed by the Department of Education.  However, the level of detail is limited, making it difficult to generate comprehensive fiscal notes.  Many entries lack crucial information such as specific dollar amounts, program descriptions, and intended outcomes.\n\nBased on the available budget documents, we can identify several categories of education spending and attempt to create preliminary fiscal notes.  These notes are incomplete due to the lack of quantitative data in the source material.\n\n**Preliminary Fiscal Notes (Incomplete due to data limitations):**\n\n**1. School Support (EDN400):**  Multiple budget documents mention funding for school support under EDN400 within HB300.  Funding sources include general funds, other federal funds, and private contributions.\n\n* **Fiscal Note:**  This budget item allocates funds for general school support activities.  The exact amount and allocation across different support areas (e.g., infrastructure, supplies, staff) are unavailable.  Funding sources are diverse, including state general funds, federal grants, and private donations.  Further detail is needed to assess the impact and effectiveness of this funding.\n\n**2. Early Learning (EDN700):**  Funding for early learning programs is also listed under HB300, with funding sources including general funds, other federal funds, and special funds.\n\n* **Fiscal Note:**  This budget item provides funding for early childhood education programs.  The specific programs funded and the amount allocated to each are unknown.  Funding comes from a mix of state and federal sources, as well as potentially special funds.  A detailed breakdown of expenditures and program outcomes is required for a complete fiscal analysis.\n\n**3. Instructional Support (EDN200):**  Instructional support receives funding from general funds and other federal funds.\n\n* **Fiscal Note:** This budget item supports instructional activities in schools.  The specific uses of these funds (e.g., teacher training, curriculum development, instructional materials) are not specified.  Funding sources include state general funds and federal grants.
