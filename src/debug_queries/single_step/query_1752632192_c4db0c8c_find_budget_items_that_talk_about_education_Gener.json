The number of participating students will determine the actual expenditure.\n\n\n**Example 2:  SB 197 \u2013 Nevada Commission on K-12 Education**\n\n* **Budget Item:** SB 197 involves restructuring the State Board of Education into the Nevada Commission on K-12 Education.\n\n* **Fiscal Note:**\n\n    * **Description:** This bill reorganizes the State Board of Education.  According to the agency's estimate (from a document dated April 18, 2011), the only new expense is administering the Statewide Council for the Coordination of Regional Training Programs.  This is estimated at $11,500 in 2011-12 and $23,000 in 2012-13.  The Department of Education claims that other operating expenditures will be absorbed from existing budgets.\n\n    * **Fiscal Impact (Estimate):**  $11,500 in 2011-12 and $23,000 in 2012-13.  The long-term impact is unclear.\n\n    * **Funding Source:**  The fiscal note indicates that if current funding levels remain, no additional costs are anticipated.  The source of the $11,500 and $23,000 is not explicitly stated.\n\n    * **Assumptions:** The Department of Education assumes that existing budgets can absorb the costs of the reorganization, except for the administration of the Statewide Council.\n\n\n**Limitations:**\n\nMany documents provide only fragments of fiscal information or examples of fiscal note formats.  Several documents mention education-related budget items but lack the necessary financial details to create complete fiscal notes.  For example, many documents show tables for fiscal notes but leave the fields blank.  Therefore, a comprehensive analysis of all education-related budget items and their corresponding fiscal notes is not possible with the provided data.  More complete budget documents are needed.",

The\nonly new expense that will be assumed by the Department is the administration of the duties of the Statewide Council\nfor the Coordination of the Regional Training Programs specified in Section 45 of the Bill. The Department does not\ncurrently have an operating budget to carry out the duties of the Statewide Council. Section 45 of the Bill transfers all\nof the duties of the Statewide Council including the requirement to conduct at least four meetings of the Council and\nthe development and assessment of a long range plan regarding the uniform training provided by the Regional Training\nPrograms.

    "Analysis complete: To identify budget items related to education and generate corresponding fiscal notes.",
    "Search completed: Found 58 relevant documents",
    "Based on the provided documents, several budget items relate to education, and we can generate corresponding fiscal notes, though the level of detail varies due to the incomplete nature of some of the source data.  The documents offer examples of fiscal note formats and guidance on their creation, but lack complete data for a comprehensive analysis of all education-related budget items.\n\n**Example 1: HB 557 \u2013 Kids Love to Read Program**\n\n* **Budget Item:**  House Bill 557 appropriates $500,000 from the Budget Reserve Trust Fund for the Kids Love to Read Program, providing books to K-5 students (50% of cost, capped at $120/student).\n\n* **Fiscal Note:**\n\n    * **Description:** This bill establishes a new program to provide books to K-5 students.  The state's contribution is capped at $120 per student, with a total appropriation of $500,000.  The program anticipates matching funds from other sources.\n\n    * **Fiscal Impact (Estimate):**  $500,000 in expenditures from the Budget Reserve Trust Fund in the current fiscal year.  Future fiscal impacts depend on the level of matching funds secured and the number of participating students.\n\n    * **Funding Source:** Budget Reserve Trust Fund.\n\n    * **Assumptions:** The success of the program depends on securing matching funds.  The number of participating students will determine the actual expenditure.\n\n\n**Example 2:  SB 197 \u2013 Nevada Commission on K-12 Education**\n\n* **Budget Item:** SB 197 involves restructuring the State Board of Education into the Nevada Commission on K-12 Education.\n\n* **Fiscal Note:**\n\n    * **Description:** This bill reorganizes the State Board of Education.  According to the agency's estimate (from a document dated April 18, 2011), the only new expense is administering the Statewide Council for the Coordination of Regional Training Programs.  This is estimated at $11,500 in 2011-12 and $23,000 in 2012-13.  The Department of Education claims that other operating expenditures will be absorbed from existing budgets.\n\n    * **Fiscal Impact (Estimate):**  $11,500 in 2011-12 and $23,000 in 2012-13.  The long-term impact is unclear.\n\n    * **Funding Source:**  The fiscal note indicates that if current funding levels remain, no additional costs are anticipated.  The source of the $11,500 and $23,000 is not explicitly stated.\n\n    * **Assumptions:** The Department of Education assumes that existing budgets can absorb the costs of the reorganization, except for the administration of the Statewide Council.\n\n\n**Limitations:**\n\nMany documents provide only fragments of fiscal information or examples of fiscal note formats.  Several documents mention education-related budget items but lack the necessary financial details to create complete fiscal notes.  For example, many documents show tables for fiscal notes but leave the fields blank.  Therefore, a comprehensive analysis of all education-related budget items and their corresponding fiscal notes is not possible with the provided data.  More complete budget documents are needed."
