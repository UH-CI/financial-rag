    "text": " \n \n \n \nThe Judiciary, State of Hawai‘i  \nTestimony to the Thirty-Third State Legislature \n2025 Regular Session \n \nHouse Committee on Judiciary and Hawaiian Affairs \nRepresentative David Tarnas, Chair \nRepresentative Mahina Poepoe, Vice Chair \n \nThursday, January 30, 2025, 2:00 p.m. \nState Capitol, Conference Room 325 and Videoconference \n \nby: \n \nBrandon M. Kimura \nPolicy and Planning Department Director \n \n \nBill No. and Title: House Bill No. 400, Relating to the Judiciary. \nPurpose: Appropriates funds for the Judiciary for the 2025–2027 biennium. \nJudiciary’s Position: \nThe Judiciary strongly urges your support of House Bill No. 400, which reflects the \nJudiciary’s resource requirements for Fiscal Biennium 2025–2027. \nBased on current circumstances and projected resource needs for the future, the Judiciary \nrequests additional operating resources in the amount of 17.0 permanent FTE and 1.0 temporary \nFTE, and $6.17M in FY 2026, and $6.25M in FY 2027. This is an addition of approximately 3% \nto the Judiciary’s operating budget. The Judiciary also requests a total of $9.9M in bond funds for \ncapital improvement projects in FY 2026. \nOperating Requests: \nThese resource requests center around funding to make permanent or expand three \nSpecialty Courts on O‘ahu, to fully staff the new Wahiawā District Court that will open during this \nbiennium, an additional District Court Judge and support staff in Kona, cybersecurity and critical \ntechnology costs, funding for the Criminal Justice Research Institute (CJRI), and restoration of \nfunding for essential staffing that was defunded during the early part of the COVID-19 pandemic. \n\nHouse Bill No. 400, Relating to the Judiciary \n \nHouse Committee on Judiciary and Hawaiian Affairs \n \nThursday, January 30, 2025 \n \nPage 2  \n \n \nAs for positions, nine of the 18 (17.0 permanent and 1.0 temporary) are requested to \ncontinue current staffing. This is because seven temporary positions for the Women’s Court Pilot \nProject, along with one permanent position and one temporary position for the CJRI, will expire, \nbut there are compelling reasons to continue these programs and the necessary staffing. The \nremaining requested positions will significantly expand capacity to certain operations. \nBrief details of each request are provided below: \nWomen’s Court – The Women’s Court Pilot Project was established by the Legislature in \nJuly of 2022 (Act 243/22) with funding for a three-year pilot that included seven temporary \npositions, which are set to expire at the end of FY 2025. The request of $705,416 in FY 2026 and \n$705,416 in FY 2027, and 8.0 FTE permanent positions will establish a permanent Women’s \nCourt. The Women’s Court, also known as Mohala Wahine, was created to address the rapid \ngrowth in the incarceration of women in the United States by providing comprehensive court-\nsupervised treatment, opportunities, and resources as an alternative to incarceration for women in \nthe criminal justice system who have suffered trauma, abuse, poverty, mental illness, substance \nuse disorders, and/or unhealthy relationships. The goal of the program is for the participants to \nidentify and address issues, to prevent re-entry into criminality, and to aid the participants in \nbettering their economic conditions and life circumstances. Given the need for the program, a \nstrong start as a three-year pilot created by the Legislature, and that the program (and positions \nand funding) will expire at the end of FY 2025, the Judiciary requests funding and eight positions \n(a net increase of one), including one substance use counselor. \nTruancy Court and Early Education Intervention Program (EEIP) – The Judiciary requests \nfunding of $188,388 in FY 2026 and $183,288 in FY 2027 to restore funding for three redescribed \nSocial Worker positions and additional expenses to significantly expand the Truancy Court and \nEEIP on O‘ahu. Truancy Court and EEIP are designed to identify and address, where possible, the \ndifficulties underlying chronic school truancy. The focus of Truancy Court is diversion from the \nformal court process. The bulk of the preventative work is done on the front-end to stop truancy \npetitions from being filed in court by addressing barriers to school attendance. To accomplish this, \nPersons in Need of Supervision (PINS) Social Workers visit campuses weekly to meet with \nstudents identified as having attendance issues. \nDriving While Impaired (DWI) Court Program – The Judiciary requests funding of \n$232,412 in FY 2026 and $237,612 in FY 2027 for two positions that will be redescribed to be a \nSocial Worker IV and Specialty Court Coordinator, and additional expenses, to make the DWI \nCourt Program permanent. The DWI Court Program was established in April 2012 and has been \noperational since January 2013, with initial federal funding for the program from the National \nHighway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) through a grant administered by the State \nDepartment of Transportation. The DWI Court Program confronts the persistent problem of \nimpaired driving and seeks to reduce recidivism among repeat and high-risk offenders by \naddressing the underlying cause of impaired driving, which is alcohol and/or substance use \ndisorder. Without intervention, this population of chronically impaired drivers might continue to \nreoffend and endanger public safety on our roadways. Securing permanent funding would allow \n\nHouse Bill No. 400, Relating to the Judiciary \n \nHouse Committee on Judiciary and Hawaiian Affairs \n \nThursday, January 30, 2025 \n \nPage 3  \n \n \nthe DWI Court Program to continue, grow, and provide accountability and monitoring of the \ntreatment and recovery process for repeat and high-risk offenders. \nWahiawā District Court – There are five requests related to the Wahiawā District Court, \nwhich will open to the public in Spring 2026. The first relates to restoring funding for three \npositions in the amount of $192,408 in FY 2026 and $192,408 in FY 2027 to transition to a full \ncomplement of adult client services to the new Wahiawā District Court to support case \nmanagement of probation cases. The planned Adult Client Services Branch (ACSB) Wahiawā \nDistrict Court Unit will play a critical role in bringing court services to the community. When the \nACSB Wahiawā District Court Unit is operational, it will service an estimated 200 to 300 cases \nbased on the current clients that reside in the designated geographic areas: Waimea, Mililani, \nKunia, Whitmore Village, Waialua, Hale‘iwa, and Sunset. \nThe second request for Wahiawā District Court is for funding of $27,084 in FY 2026 (six \nmonths’ salary only) and $54,168 in FY 2027, and 1.0 FTE permanent position for a Janitor II. \nThe existing Wahiawā District Courthouse is in a rental space and janitorial services are covered \nby the lease. This position is necessary to support cleaning levels for the types of uses in the new \nfacility. For instance, the existing facility does not include a probation unit which performs drug \ntesting and will require additional cleaning.  This position is requested to provide the level of \ncleaning required to provide a clean and healthy environment for all who enter and use the facility. \nThe third request for Wahiawā District Court is funding of $346,209 in FY 2026 and \n$486,967 in FY 2027 to provide contracted security personnel for patrol, primarily interior. The \nnew courthouse will have two courtrooms and expand its services to include Ho‘okele (court \ninformation services), civil case processing, and probation services. Courthouse security for the \ncurrent location consists of two unarmed contracted private security personnel and one Deputy \nSheriff under the District Court Sheriff Command. To meet best practices, the new Wahiawā \nDistrict Court would need one sergeant and three Deputy Sheriffs assigned to patrol the new \nWahiawā District Court. Contracted security services could provide an alternative, albeit less than \noptimal. Funding this request would support this critical safety function. \nThe fourth request for Wahiawā District Court is to restore funding of $52,908 in FY 2026 \nand $52,908 in FY 2027 for a position redescribed to an IT Tech III and dedicated to this facility. \nThis IT Tech will provide support for courtroom video recording and video conferencing systems \nthat enable litigants to participate in court hearings remotely. The new Wahiawā District Court \nwill feature an additional courtroom, as well as an increased number of employees permanently \nbased there.  Since the pandemic, the First Circuit has permitted most District Court litigants to \nopt for remote hearing appearances by Zoom. At some hearings, dozens of litigants do so. A \nfunctioning courtroom AV system is therefore critical to the core operations of the court. \nThe fifth request for Wahiawā District Court is to restore funding of $317,448 in FY 2026 \nand $317,448 in FY 2027 for four District Court Clerk II and two Bailiff II positions. These \npositions, based in Wahiawā, will also support ‘Ewa and Wai‘anae District Courts, thereby \nenhancing the services available at these three rural courts. These positions provide courtroom \n\nHouse Bill No. 400, Relating to the Judiciary \n \nHouse Committee on Judiciary and Hawaiian Affairs \n \nThursday, January 30, 2025 \n \nPage 4  \n \n \nclerical coverage for District Court criminal, civil, and traffic proceedings, and associated court \nclerical duties to record and facilitate cases throughout the court system. Upon opening and staffing \nof the Wahiawā District Court, civil filings, Ho‘okele, and court hearings for these areas would be \ntransferred there, from downtown Honolulu. A dedicated and permanent staff of District Court \nClerks in Wahiawā would facilitate and streamline coverage for the ‘Ewa, Wai‘anae, and Wahiawā \nDistrict Court civil calendars—Wahiawā would be the hub. Restoring the funding for these \npositions will allow the West and Central O‘ahu court users to expeditiously access and attend \nDistrict Court business and enable the District Courts to facilitate and adjudicate cases in a more \nefficient manner. \nKona District Court Judge – The Judiciary requests $368,943 in FY 2026 and $360,048 in \nFY 2027, and 4.0 FTE permanent positions, for an additional District Court Judge and three \nnecessary support staff. The additional judgeship is needed to address the current extraordinary \ncaseload in Kona, as well as the continuing increases in complexity of cases and the time required \nto schedule and hear cases on the court calendars, and to improve public service and safety. The \nKona District Court is assigned to hear all District Court criminal, traffic, and civil matters for the \ndivisions of North Kona, South Kona, and Ka‘ū. The first Kona District Court Judge was sworn in \nnearly forty years ago. Since then, the combined population of North and South Kona and Ka‘ū \nhas more than doubled. The current caseload of the Kona District Court is nearly 16,000 cases \nannually, which are all currently being handled by one judge in one courtroom. This combination \nof factors has led to unsustainable court congestion and delays. \nCybersecurity and Technology – The Judiciary has three requests pertaining to \ncybersecurity and other technology.  \nFirst, is a request for $1,175,300 in FY 2026 and $1,175,300 in FY 2027 to upgrade email \nsubscriptions to improve security capabilities. The Judiciary currently uses Microsoft O365 for \nbasic email with multifactor authentication and basic threat detection and protection. With \ngovernment agencies and courts increasingly being targeted for cybersecurity attacks, this level of \nsecurity is no longer sufficient. Upgrading from O365 basic email to M365 G5 email would \nsignificantly enhance the Judiciary’s cybersecurity posture. M365 G5 email—the same level of \nthe State of Hawai‘i Executive Branch, which the Legislature funded during the 2024 Regular \nSession—includes robust cybersecurity features that address prevention, detection, investigation, \nand remediation of cybersecurity attacks on emails and Sharepoint data. \nThe second cybersecurity-related request is for $458,224 in FYs 2026 and 2027 to restore \nfunding for four positions that have since been redescribed to a modern need—a dedicated \ncybersecurity staff. In addition, this funding would allow for additional tools required to manage \nthe Judiciary’s inventory of assets in an efficient and secure way. Specifically, this includes a suite \nthat can create strong access control, maintain a current inventory and patch the assets, and \nmaintain configuration baselines. \nThe third technology-focused request is for $560,000 in FY 2026 and $420,000 in FY 2027 \nto replace network switches in courthouses across the state that have reached their end-of-life. \n\nHouse Bill No. 400, Relating to the Judiciary \n \nHouse Committee on Judiciary and Hawaiian Affairs \n \nThursday, January 30, 2025 \n \nPage 5  \n \n \nNetwork switches provide internet and phone connections to PCs, Cisco phones, printers, and \ncourtroom devices. They were last replaced between 2016 and 2018; the average useful lifespan \nis between five to eight years. As network switches age, network connections become unreliable \nand eventually become inoperable. A significant number of Judiciary courthouse network switches \nhave reached the end of their useful lifespan. \nCriminal Justice Research Institute (CJRI) – There are two requests related to the Criminal \nJustice Research Institute, established by Act 179 (SLH 2019). Both are to continue the resources \nappropriated in Act 147 (SLH 2023). More specifically, the first is $512,624 in FY 2026 and \n$577,058 in FY 2027, for a 1.0 FTE permanent Project Specialist position and software. Act 147 \n(SLH 2023) appropriated funds for a permanent Project Specialist and software/technology costs \nfor two years to begin to establish a centralized statewide criminal pretrial justice data reporting \nand collection system. Since then, CJRI has developed the foundation, including continuing to \ncreate a data warehouse and software tool that will modernize data sharing and create a centralized \nsource of pretrial data. CJRI has obtained 15 years of pretrial data from the Department of Law \nEnforcement, the Department of Attorney General, and the Judiciary, and has partnered with these \nagencies to begin mapping data to draft data pipelines. Staff have been trained with software to \ningest data into the data warehouse and established preliminary datasets for pretrial research. The \nProject Specialist position was created to support CJRI with in-house IT expertise. Although the \nposition is permanent, funding ends on June 30, 2025. To build upon this firm foundation, continue \nwork to establish a centralized statewide criminal pretrial justice data reporting and collection \nsystem, as well as continue to assess data and be available to inform policymakers, CJRI requires \nthat resources continue. \nThe second CJRI-related request is to continue 1.0 FTE temporary Project Specialist and \n$71,016 in both years of the biennium. In addition to the permanent position with two-year funding \ndescribed above, Act 147 (SLH 2023) authorized a temporary full-time Project Specialist position, \nalso with two-year funding ending on June 30, 2025. This position ensures that the Judiciary can \nfully support CJRI’s technical needs with a position in the Judiciary’s IT department focused on \nthe CJRI. As Judiciary data is ingested into the data warehouse, CJRI researchers need support \nfrom the Judiciary technical staff to ensure that the data is transformed into criminal pretrial data \nfor meaningful use for research. \nOffice of the Public Guardian (OPG) – The Judiciary requests $136,314 in FY 2026 and \n$125,424 in FY 2027, and 3.0 FTE permanent positions, for three Social Services Assistant IV \npositions and related equipment for the Office of the Public Guardian. The positions will assist the \nThird Circuit (Hawai‘i County) and First Circuit (City and County of Honolulu) guardians. OPG \npersonnel are court-appointed to make informed decisions in the best interests of incapacitated \nindividuals by safeguarding their rights, dignity, humanity, and quality of life. When OPG is \nappointed as guardian, it comes with a myriad of challenges associated with researching and \nuntangling the ward’s unique situation. This work requires the guardians to work within many \nsystems and gain familiarity with each ward. The additional positions will be assigned medium \nand low priority tasks that are necessary but are often deferred because of urgent or emergent \n\nHouse Bill No. 400, Relating to the Judiciary \n \nHouse Committee on Judiciary and Hawaiian Affairs \n \nThursday, January 30, 2025 \n \nPage 6  \n \n \ncircumstances for less stable wards. In addition, Social Services Assistants could improve safety \nwhen accompanying guardians in certain situations. Staff sometimes enter homes where other \nresidents who are not under OPG’s care are unstable. Guardians have experienced threats of \nviolence, dog bites, and other safety concerns. The Social Services Assistants would enable \nguardians to increase visits and care to all OPG wards. \nRisk Management Cost – The Judiciary requests $151,000 in FY 2026 and $151,000 in \nFY 2027 to cover an increase in the risk management costs owed to the Department of Accounting \nand General Services (DAGS). Pursuant to Comptroller Memoranda 1999-28 and 2007-05, and \nHRS § 41-D(4), DAGS bills the Judiciary annually for its share of the state’s risk management \ncosts which include insurance policy premiums. DAGS notified the Judiciary that its share of the \nrisk management costs would increase by approximately $151,000. \nTargeted Funding Restoration – The Judiciary’s next group of requests is to restore funding \nfor selected defunded positions. During the early part of the pandemic, over $11 million was \nremoved from the Judiciary’s budget for 192 vacant positions, to help the State’s economic crisis \nat that time. The Judiciary has continued to refine staffing statewide, including redescribing \npositions to modern needs and employing additional recruitment methods, particularly for \npositions where there have been recruiting difficulties. Nevertheless, these requests to restore \nfunding are for positions critical to operations now and going forward. Specifically: \n(1) \nCourts of Appeal \nRestored funding of $72,372 for FY 2026 and $72,372 in FY 2027 for a Judicial Assistant \nII at the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) would ensure necessary support to each judge of this \nCourt. There are positions for six Associate Judges in the ICA and one Chief Judge. Each judge \nhas a single Judicial Assistant II, and each position is imperative to the operations of the ICA. ICA \nJudicial Assistants use the Judiciary Information Management System (JIMS) and ICA internal \ndatabase, assist with hiring and personnel matters, assist in compiling reports and statistics, assist \nin training of Law Clerks and Staff Attorneys, provide coverage as needed for other Judicial \nAssistants and Appellate Clerks, assist with screening of cases for conflicts of interest, and \nundertake numerous housekeeping and institutional tasks that maintain the high standard and spirit \nof aloha that is the hallmark of the ICA. \n(2) \nFirst Circuit  \nRestored funding of $47,004 in FY 2026 and $47,004 in FY 2027 for one position \nredescribed to a Judicial Clerk III. The shift in court operations to many virtual hearings has \nbenefitted court-users, but has strained staffing. This position, updated to a modern need, would \nhost remote hearings, process calendars for various case types, obtain and review efiled documents \nin traffic and criminal cases, and more. Existing staff have covered these responsibilities, \nsometimes leading to delays or backlogs in other sections. This is unsustainable. \n\nHouse Bill No. 400, Relating to the Judiciary \n \nHouse Committee on Judiciary and Hawaiian Affairs \n \nThursday, January 30, 2025 \n \nPage 7  \n \n \nRestored funding of $105,816 in FY 2026 and $105,816 in FY 2027 for two hybrid District \nCourt Clerks IIs and Bailiffs. Two District Court Clerk positions will be redescribed to hybrid \nClerks and Bailiffs to increase flexibility to address court needs. Specifically, these hybrid \npositions would increase the Honolulu District Court’s capacity to meet needs in courtrooms, \nincluding processing witness certification fees and implementing in-court processing, which \nwould reduce delays in updating and processing the court record and delays in litigants’ ability to \nobtain case-related court dates. \n(3) \nSecond Circuit \nThe Judiciary requests restoration of a subtotal of $151,032 for both years of the biennium \nfor a District Court Clerk in Lahaina, a District Court Clerk in Wailuku, and an Account Clerk. \nThe District Court Clerk in Lahaina is responsible for the official court records in \narraignment and trial proceedings. This position issues disposition slips to the public as they \nconclude their proceedings, ensures documents are submitted and conformed to statutory and \nprocedural requirements, prepares warrants and orders pertaining to bail that may result in money \nbeing returned, and assists the public over the counter and over the telephone. This position is \nessential to rural courtroom services. \nThe Wailuku District Court Clerk position is necessary to normalize staffing levels and \nimprove service to the public. In this largest court facility in the county, inadequate staffing leads \nto delays and the inability to cover—as is often needed—rural courts that struggle with staffing. \nThe Account Clerk IV position provides critical support services to the Fiscal Office and \nthe public. This includes creating purchase orders and processing invoices. While each position is \nresponsible for a particular appropriation, the amount assigned to this defunded position has \nincreased by over 25% since FY 2021. Since this position was defunded, the Second Circuit’s \nFiscal Office assumed the responsibilities, thereby diverting focus from the Fiscal Office’s primary \nduties. \n(4) \nThird Circuit \nA key request in the Third Circuit is to restore $73,836 in FY 2026 and $73,836 in FY 2027 \nfor a Social Worker IV in the Kona Juvenile Client Services Branch. While this position was \ndefunded early in the pandemic, Third Circuit decided to fill the position in March 2022 because \nthe remaining two staff were overwhelmed by attempting to address all informal status offenses, \nlaw violators, and school nonattendance referrals. The Third Circuit used resources from funded \nvacancies, fewer jury trials, and other areas to fund and fill this position at that time. Due to \nincreasing budget constraints, this is not sustainable without detrimental effects on other court \noperations. \nNext is a request to restore $57,192 in FY 2026 and $57,192 in FY 2027 for a Court \nDocuments Clerk III in the Hilo Legal Documents Branch. This position, among other duties, \n\nHouse Bill No. 400, Relating to the Judiciary \n \nHouse Committee on Judiciary and Hawaiian Affairs \n \nThursday, January 30, 2025 \n \nPage 8  \n \n \nassists with Circuit and Family Court filings. This includes addressing time-sensitive filings, such \nas Temporary Restraining Orders (TROs), and assisting self-represented litigants (SRLs) at the \ncounter and over the phone. There has been a steady and significant increase in TROs filed in Hilo. \nIndeed, from 2019 to 2022, TRO filings in Hilo, particularly related to domestic abuse cases, have \nmore than doubled the amount in Kona. \nThe next request is to restore $47,004 in FY 2026 and $47,004 in FY 2027 for a Judicial \nClerk III position in the Kona Traffic Violations Branch. This section supports one District Court \nJudge that hears cases from the North and South Kona and Ka‘ū Districts. The vacancy of this \nposition has caused a backlog in creating citations in the Judiciary Information Management \nSystem (JIMS) and processing default judgments. Although some automation has made many \ntasks easier, automation in this unit has not offset added demands. The complexity of the legal \nprocess requires staff to articulate the information to self-represented litigants (SRLs) and process \nthe work accurately and efficiently. \nFinally, the Third Circuit requests to restore $52,908 in FY 2026 and $52,908 in FY 2027 \nfor an IT Support Technician III in Hilo. Third Circuit’s limited IT support must cover a large land \narea and three facilities. Indeed, these responsibilities are so important that the Third Circuit \nredescribed a defunded position into this IT Support Technician III and filled the position, using \ninternal funding from other areas available due to the COVID-19 pandemic leading to temporary \nshifts in operations. This is unsustainable without detrimental impacts to other operations. \n(5) \nAdministration \nRestored funding of $71,016 in FY 2026 and $71,016 in FY 2027 for a Purchasing and \nSpecifications Specialist in the Judiciary’s Financial Services Department. This position is in a \ndivision that is responsible for a high volume of purchasing, procurement, and contracts. Among \nother things, this division annually processes over 1,000 purchase requisitions, nearly 900 \ncontracts, and approximately 12 Competitive Sealed Bids and 17 Competitive Purchase of Service \nand Competitive Sealed Proposals solicitations. \nCapital Improvement Requests: \nCapital Improvement Project (CIP) requirements continue to remain a major item of \nconcern as the Judiciary’s infrastructure continues to age and deteriorate, and as the population \nserved and services provided by the Judiciary continue to expand. We request CIP bond funds \ntotaling $9.9 million for FY 2026 to address critical needs, some of which relate to the health and \nsafety of Judiciary employees and the public.  \nSpecifically, the Judiciary is requesting $4.0 million to design a new South Kohala District \nCourthouse. The current South Kohala District Court carries significant concerns for safety, space, \ntemperature, noise, and is quite simply inadequate to serve the community’s court-related needs. \nThe Judiciary also requests $900,000 to replace an A/C chiller on Kaua‘i, at Pu‘uhonua Kaulike. \nThe chiller is near the end of its lifecycle, and A/C manufacturing is experiencing hardships \n\nHouse Bill No. 400, Relating to the Judiciary \n \nHouse Committee on Judiciary and Hawaiian Affairs \n \nThursday, January 30, 2025 \n \nPage 9  \n \n \nresulting in long lead times. The Judiciary also requests $5.0 million in lump sum bond funds to \naddress both continuing and emerging building issues statewide. \nThe Judiciary respectfully requests your support of House Bill No. 400, the Judiciary’s \nbiennium budget request. \nThank you for the opportunity to testify on this measure. \n\n \n \n70170 \n  \nNickolas Kacprowski \nBoard President  \nRachel Figueroa \nExecutive Director  \n  \n545 Queen Street, Suite 100 \nHonolulu, Hawai`i 96813  \nPhone: (808) 528-7050  \nFax: (808) 524-2147  \n www.vlsh.org  \n \nTESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF H.B. 400 \nRELATING TO THE JUDICIARY \nCommittee on Judiciary & Hawaiian Affairs – January 30, 2025  2:00 p.m. \n  \nCHAIR TARNAS, VICE CHAIR POEPOE AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON \nJUDICIARY & HAWAIIAN AFFAIRS:   \n  \nVolunteer Legal Services Hawai‘i supports the passage of H.B. 400.   \n \nThis critical funding would go to funding civil legal services, including but not limited to the \ndelivery of civil legal services to low- and moderate- income individuals in Hawai‘i.  \n \nVolunteer Legal is pursuing a one million (1,000,000) dollar increase in funding for the civil \nlegal services line item for providers. The civil legal services line item was initially intended for \nstatewide general civil legal service providers. Other important legal service providers are now \naccessing the funding, and we anticipate that more will apply. \n \nVolunteer Legal is concerned about all the federal actions limiting services to those residents \nwho need it the most.  We are more worried than ever about the impact that the limiting of services has \non the safety net of legal services. There are many unmet needs1, and Volunteer Legal is often the last \nline of defense for someone facing critical issues, like landlord/tenant or child custody issues.  \n \n In the last forty-four years, Volunteer Legal has partnered with volunteer attorneys in the \nprovision of civil legal assistance to individuals and families of Hawaii.  While Volunteer Legal \nServices Hawai‘i’s only office is on Oahu, we service residents of Hawai‘i statewide.  In 2024, with \nonly a staff of 9, Volunteer Legal qualified around 1000 individuals. Volunteer Legal provides legal \ncheckups, educational presentations, clinics, brief services and/or full representations.  Twenty-one \n(21%) of those helped are homeless or at the risk of being homeless, 28% of those helped suffer from \ndomestic violence, 6% of those helped were veterans, 26% of those helped are disabled, and 20% of \nthose helped were aged 60 and over.  If not for Volunteer Legal Services Hawaii, these individuals \nwould have otherwise gone without legal help.   \n \nVolunteer Legal Services Hawai‘i thanks the committee for the past support of legal services \nin the judiciary budget.  We respectfully request your passage of H.B. 400.  Thank you for this \nopportunity to provide testimony.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSincerely,  \nRachel Figueroa, Executive Director \n \n \n \n1According to the ALICE (Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed) report in 2022, in Hawaii alone, 11% of \nresidents were below the Federal Poverty Line (FPL), with 33% that earned above the Federal Poverty Line but not enough \nto afford the basics in the community where they live.  https://unitedforalice.org/national-overview \n“Low-income Americans do not get any or enough legal help for 92% of their substantial civil legal problems.” \nhttps://justicegap.lsc.gov/resource/executive-summary/ \n\n \n \nTelephone: (808) 536-4302  Fax: (808) 527-8088 \nMailing Address: P.O.

In addition to supporting the Judiciary’s budget priorities, we support an additional \n$1,000,000 increase in the budget line-item for statewide civil legal services. \nHB400 contains a line-item for statewide civil legal services, which the Judiciary administers to \nthe State’s qualifying legal services providers to provide “general civil legal services without \ncharge to indigent residents of the State of Hawaiʻi.” This line-item is vital to meeting the needs \nof our residents statewide, and more funding is needed to attempt to meet the unmet critical legal \nneeds of our communities. \nIMPACT OF HB400 \nWith the support of this line-item, Legal Aid has been able to provide civil legal services to our \nlow-income and vulnerable populations across our state. As the state’s largest and oldest legal \nservice provider, we deliver legal services in the areas most needed by Hawaiʻi’s residents, \nincluding family law, housing, domestic abuse, consumer protection, immigration law, public \nbenefits, child welfare, and elder law. Legal Aid provides these services statewide through its 12 \noffices located in every county and on every island, as well as through our Maui Disaster Legal \nServices office and our Hawaiʻi Immigrant Justice Center. Our over 100 dedicated staff are all \ncommited to our mission of obtaining a fair and just Hawaiʻi for all. \nEach year, Legal Aid impacts the lives of approximately 20,000 Hawaiʻi residents. In the last fiscal \nyear, we received over 15,000 requests for assistance and were able to provide legal help in a little \nover 7000 cases in legal areas ranging from family, housing, consumer, foreclosure, public \nbenefits, elder law, homelessness, immigration, language access, and child welfare. Of those \nserved last year, over 2,000 of our clients were homeless or at risk for homelessness, over 1,600 \nare Native Hawaiian, over 1,200 experienced domestic violence and about 700 spoke a primary \nlanguage other than English.  \n \n \n\n \n \nNEED FOR INCREASED FUNDING \nWe are grateful for the legislature for their past and continuing support of general civil legal \nservices in the Judiciary budget, and to the Judiciary for providing a home for this program and \nadministering these important funds. However, more funding is urgently needed. \nIn Legal Services Corporation’s Justice Gap Report (2022), researchers found that “low-income \n[individuals] did not receive any or enough legal help for 92% of their civil legal problems[,]” \nand that Hawaiʻi is unfortunately consistent with this national average. More than one-half of \npeople nationwide have no confidence that they would be able to find a lawyer they could afford \nif they needed one. In Hawaiʻi, at least 72% of households had one or more civil legal problems \nin the past year. Current resources are not meeting our community’s needs: the National Justice \nIndex determined that nine times as many legal services attorneys and advocates are needed to \nmeet Hawaiʻi low-income residents’ legal needs. \n \nChanges to the federal funding and policy landscape also require additional support for \nHawaiʻi’s legal services providers. Recently, there have been dramatic reductions in available \nfederal funds for victims of crime and domestic-violence survivors. This week’s temporary \nfunding freeze by the Office of Management and Budget threatened to impact federal funds for \nwork related to housing, assisting Hawaiʻi’s houseless communities, kūpuna legal services, \nhealth insurance navigators, and more, and is a clear preview of what’s to come. Disaster legal \nservices, which includes over one million in funding for Hawaiʻi, was also recently left out of the \nmost recent funding resolution. And, it is likely that we will see attempts to “zero out” funding \nfor legal services, which happened four years in a row when this current administration was \npreviously in office.  \n \nThere are now four legal service providers recieving this critical funding, and all of our low-\nincome and vulnerable populations statewide and across demographics are positively impacted \nby this support. We respectfully request that you increase support for legal services by adding an \nadditional $1,000,000 to the line item for legal services, which is an important part of the safety \nnet of social services that Hawaiʻi’s residents need.  \n \nThe Judiciary has been a leader in supporting “access to justice” initiatives here in Hawaiʻi, and \nhas generously provided a home for this line-item. Our ask is intended to supplement the \nJudiciary’s legislative priorities, and should not come at the expense of any priority or portion \nof the proposed budget. \n \nThank you for this opportunity to provide testimony. \n \nSincerely, \nDavid Kaulia Kopper  \nExecutive Director, Legal Aid Society of Hawaiʻi \n \n \n \n \n\n \nMakiki: 1020 South Beretania St., Honolulu, Hawai‘i  96814     Downtown: 1188 Bishop St., Ste 3209, Honolulu, HI 96813 \nwww.tlchawaii.org    (808) 777-7071    fax (808) 930-0969 \n \nStatement Before The \nThursday, January 30, 2025 \n2:00 PM \nConference Room 325 & Videoconference \n \nin consideration of \nHB400 \n \nRELATING TO JUDICIARY. \n \nChair TARNAS, Vice Chair POEPOE, and Members of the House Judiciary Committees \n \nThe Legal Clinic (TLC) supports HB400, which appropriates funds for the Judiciary for the fiscal biennium \nbeginning 7/1/2025, and ending 6/30/2027. \n \nTLC is a Hawai‘i nonprofit, nonpartisan organization. TLC is a direct legal services provider, representing \nthose in Hawai‘i who meet income eligibility guidelines without regard to immigration status, national \norigin, ethnic background, race, religion, ideology, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, or disability. \nTLC works alongside immigrants so they can attain authorization to work and live with dignity, reunite \nwith their families after years of separation and escape horrific violence to find refuge in the United \nStates. TLC recognizes that every person needs and deserves to feel a sense of trust, welcome, and \nbelonging. \n \nTLC is a current grantee under the Judiciary’s civil legal services fund. The Judiciary’s civil legal services \nfund is critical to supporting safety net providers in Hawaii. TLC supports the current budget of $1.2 \nmillion and an increase of an additional $1 million to support the work of safety net providers in the \nlocal community. The needs of local safety net providers are continually growing. For example, with the \ncurrent federal administration’s immigration enforcement actions and rhetoric, TLC anticipates an \nexponential increase in those needing support in immigration proceedings.   \n \nThus, TLC supports the current budget of $1.2 million and an increase of an additional $1 million to the \nthe Judiciary’s civil legal services fund. Thank you for the opportunity to testify in support of HB400 and \nTLC respectfully urges the Committee members to pass HB400 out of your Committee.  If you have \nquestions of me, please contact me at sma@tlchawaii.org.  \n \nVery respectfully yours, \n \nAmy Agbayani  \n \n \n \nSandy Ma \n \nAmy Agbayani, Ph.D. \n \n \n \nSandy Ma \nBoard Member  \n \n \n \nCommunity & Policy Advocate \nThe Legal Clinic  \n \n \n \nThe Legal Clinic \n \n \n \n \n LATE *Testimony submitted late may not be considered by the Committee for decision making purposes. \n\nHB-400 \nSubmitted on: 1/30/2025 7:20:32 AM \nTestimony for JHA on 1/30/2025 2:00:00 PM \nSubmitted By \nOrganization \nTestifier Position \nTestify \nPatricia Blair \nIndividual \nSupport \nWritten Testimony \nOnly \n \n \nComments:  \nI support continuing and expanding this program. \n \n LATE *Testimony submitted late may not be considered by the Committee for decision making purposes. \n\nHB-400 \nSubmitted on: 1/30/2025 10:25:18 AM \nTestimony for JHA on 1/30/2025 2:00:00 PM \nSubmitted By \nOrganization \nTestifier Position \nTestify \nMihoko Ito  \nIndividual \nSupport \nWritten Testimony \nOnly \n \n \nComments:  \nThank you for the opportunity to submit testimony in strong support of the Judiciary Budget, HB \n400.  I am very supportive of the Judiciary and all of the work that they do in and for our \ncommunity.  I am also very much in support of the current line item in the budget that supports \nfunding for civil legal services (currently funded at $1.2M), but would respectfully request \nthat the amount be increased by and additional $1M.  \nHaving worked on civil legal service provider funding for many years, I am aware that civil legal \nservice providers are chronically underfunded.  With all the uncertainties at the federal level, this \nfunding is more critical than ever. Legal service providers are often the last line of defense \nprotecting individuals from eviction, deportation, homelessness, family separation and other \nbarriers to basic survival in our community.  \nWith respect to the line item for funding in the Judiciary budget, the purchase of services funding \nthe Legislature has provided was historically for statewide general civil legal services, but under \nthe current Judiciary criteria is now open to all civil legal services providers. This has ultimately \ndiluted critical safety net funding, so we are asking for a $1M increase to support the critical \nwork that these organizations provide. To be clear, I do not want our request to supplant any of \nthe Judiciary's other priorities, but respecfully ask that consideration be given to this request for \nan increase in legal service providers funding. \nThank you for the opportunity to submit testimony in strong support of this measure. \nMihoko Ito \n \n LATE *Testimony submitted late may not be considered by the Committee for decision making purposes. \n"

    "text": " \n \n \n \nThe Judiciary, State of Hawai‘i  \nTestimony to the Thirty-Third State Legislature \n2025 Regular Session \n \nHouse Committee on Finance \nRepresentative Kyle T. Yamashita, Chair \nRepresentative Jenna Takenouchi, Vice Chair \nWednesday, March 5, 2025, 9:00 a.m. \nState Capitol, Conference Room 308 and Videoconference \n \nby: \n \nBrandon M. Kimura \nPolicy and Planning Department Director \n \n \nBill No. and Title: House Bill No. 400, Relating to the Judiciary. \nPurpose: Appropriates funds for the Judiciary for the 2025–2027 biennium. \nJudiciary’s Position: \nThe Judiciary strongly urges your support of House Bill No. 400, which reflects the \nJudiciary’s resource requirements for Fiscal Biennium 2025–2027. \nBased on current circumstances and projected resource needs for the future, the Judiciary \nrequests additional operating resources in the amount of 17.0 permanent FTE and 1.0 temporary \nFTE, and $6.17M in FY 2026, and $6.25M in FY 2027. This is an addition of approximately 3% \nto the Judiciary’s operating budget. The Judiciary remains vigilant during this period of uncertainty \nover federal funding and the possible impact on the State and Judiciary budgets and operations. \nWe have assessed federally-funded grant projects of the Judiciary and are committed to ongoing \ncommunication with the Legislature and with local non-governmental partners of the Judiciary \nwho rely on federal funding. \nThe Judiciary also requests a total of $11.9M in bond funds for capital improvement \nprojects in FY 2026. This amount in bond funds includes a request for $2M more in lump sum \nbond funds than the Judiciary’s request as introduced. This is because in recent weeks the Judiciary \nreceived new information that the relocation of the Children’s Justice Center on O‘ahu will require \nat least $2M more than previously appropriated. These circumstances are detailed further below. \n\nHouse Bill No. 400, Relating to the Judiciary \n \nHouse Committee on Finance \n \nWednesday, March 5, 2025 \n \nPage 2  \n \n \nOperating Requests: \nOperating resource requests center around funding to make permanent or expand three \nSpecialty Courts on O‘ahu, to fully staff the new Wahiawā District Court that will open during this \nbiennium, an additional District Court Judge and support staff in Kona, cybersecurity and critical \ntechnology costs, funding for the Criminal Justice Research Institute (CJRI), and restoration of \nfunding for essential staffing that was defunded during the early part of the COVID-19 pandemic. \nAs for positions, nine of the 18 (17.0 permanent and 1.0 temporary) are requested to \ncontinue current staffing. This is because seven temporary positions for the Women’s Court Pilot \nProject, along with one permanent position and one temporary position for the CJRI, will expire, \nbut there are compelling reasons to continue these programs and the necessary staffing. The \nremaining requested positions will significantly expand capacity to certain operations. \nBrief details of each request are provided below: \nWomen’s Court – The Women’s Court Pilot Project was established by the Legislature in \nJuly of 2022 (Act 243/22) with funding for a three-year pilot that included seven temporary \npositions, which are set to expire at the end of FY 2025. The request of $705,416 in FY 2026 and \n$705,416 in FY 2027, and 8.0 FTE permanent positions will establish a permanent Women’s \nCourt. The Women’s Court, also known as Mohala Wahine, was created to address the rapid \ngrowth in the incarceration of women in the United States by providing comprehensive court-\nsupervised treatment, opportunities, and resources as an alternative to incarceration for women in \nthe criminal justice system who have suffered trauma, abuse, poverty, mental illness, substance \nuse disorders, and/or unhealthy relationships. The goal of the program is for the participants to \nidentify and address issues, to prevent re-entry into criminality, and to aid the participants in \nbettering their economic conditions and life circumstances. Given the need for the program, a \nstrong start as a three-year pilot created by the Legislature, and that the program (and positions \nand funding) will expire at the end of FY 2025, the Judiciary requests funding and eight positions \n(a net increase of one), including one substance use counselor. \nTruancy Court and Early Education Intervention Program (EEIP) – The Judiciary requests \nfunding of $188,388 in FY 2026 and $183,288 in FY 2027 to restore funding for three redescribed \nSocial Worker positions and additional expenses to significantly expand the Truancy Court and \nEEIP on O‘ahu. Truancy Court and EEIP are designed to identify and address, where possible, the \ndifficulties underlying chronic school truancy. The focus of Truancy Court is diversion from the \nformal court process. The bulk of the preventative work is done on the front-end to stop truancy \npetitions from being filed in court by addressing barriers to school attendance. To accomplish this, \nPersons in Need of Supervision (PINS) Social Workers visit campuses weekly to meet with \nstudents identified as having attendance issues. \nDriving While Impaired (DWI) Court Program – The Judiciary requests funding of \n$232,412 in FY 2026 and $237,612 in FY 2027 for two positions that will be redescribed to be a \nSocial Worker IV and Specialty Court Coordinator, and additional expenses, to make the DWI \n\nHouse Bill No. 400, Relating to the Judiciary \n \nHouse Committee on Finance \n \nWednesday, March 5, 2025 \n \nPage 3  \n \n \nCourt Program permanent. The DWI Court Program was established in April 2012 and has been \noperational since January 2013, with initial federal funding for the program from the National \nHighway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) through a grant administered by the State \nDepartment of Transportation. The DWI Court Program confronts the persistent problem of \nimpaired driving and seeks to reduce recidivism among repeat and high-risk offenders by \naddressing the underlying cause of impaired driving, which is alcohol and/or substance use \ndisorder. Without intervention, this population of chronically impaired drivers might continue to \nreoffend and endanger public safety on our roadways. Securing permanent funding would allow \nthe DWI Court Program to continue, grow, and provide accountability and monitoring of the \ntreatment and recovery process for repeat and high-risk offenders. \nWahiawā District Court – There are five requests related to the Wahiawā District Court, \nwhich will open to the public in Spring 2026. The first relates to restoring funding for three \npositions in the amount of $192,408 in FY 2026 and $192,408 in FY 2027 to transition to a full \ncomplement of adult client services to the new Wahiawā District Court to support case \nmanagement of probation cases. The planned Adult Client Services Branch (ACSB) Wahiawā \nDistrict Court Unit will play a critical role in bringing court services to the community. When the \nACSB Wahiawā District Court Unit is operational, it will service an estimated 200 to 300 cases \nbased on the current clients that reside in the designated geographic areas: Waimea, Mililani, \nKunia, Whitmore Village, Waialua, Hale‘iwa, and Sunset. \nThe second request for Wahiawā District Court is for funding of $27,084 in FY 2026 (six \nmonths’ salary only) and $54,168 in FY 2027, and 1.0 FTE permanent position for a Janitor II. \nThe existing Wahiawā District Courthouse is in a rental space and janitorial services are covered \nby the lease. This position is necessary to support cleaning levels for the types of uses in the new \nfacility. For instance, the existing facility does not include a probation unit which performs drug \ntesting and will require additional cleaning.  This position is requested to provide the level of \ncleaning required to provide a clean and healthy environment for all who enter and use the facility. \nThe third request for Wahiawā District Court is funding of $346,209 in FY 2026 and \n$486,967 in FY 2027 to provide contracted security personnel for patrol, primarily interior. The \nnew courthouse will have two courtrooms and expand its services to include Ho‘okele (court \ninformation services), civil case processing, and probation services. Courthouse security for the \ncurrent location consists of two unarmed contracted private security personnel and one Deputy \nSheriff under the District Court Sheriff Command. To meet best practices, the new Wahiawā \nDistrict Court would need one sergeant and three Deputy Sheriffs assigned to patrol the new \nWahiawā District Court. Contracted security services could provide an alternative, albeit less than \noptimal. Funding this request would support this critical safety function. \nThe fourth request for Wahiawā District Court is to restore funding of $52,908 in FY 2026 \nand $52,908 in FY 2027 for a position redescribed to an IT Tech III and dedicated to this facility. \nThis IT Tech will provide support for courtroom video recording and video conferencing systems \nthat enable litigants to participate in court hearings remotely. The new Wahiawā District Court \nwill feature an additional courtroom, as well as an increased number of employees permanently \n\nHouse Bill No. 400, Relating to the Judiciary \n \nHouse Committee on Finance \n \nWednesday, March 5, 2025 \n \nPage 4  \n \n \nbased there.  Since the pandemic, the First Circuit has permitted most District Court litigants to \nopt for remote hearing appearances by Zoom. At some hearings, dozens of litigants do so. A \nfunctioning courtroom AV system is therefore critical to the core operations of the court. \nThe fifth request for Wahiawā District Court is to restore funding of $317,448 in FY 2026 \nand $317,448 in FY 2027 for four District Court Clerk II and two Bailiff II positions. These \npositions, based in Wahiawā, will also support ‘Ewa and Wai‘anae District Courts, thereby \nenhancing the services available at these three rural courts. These positions provide courtroom \nclerical coverage for District Court criminal, civil, and traffic proceedings, and associated court \nclerical duties to record and facilitate cases throughout the court system. Upon opening and staffing \nof the Wahiawā District Court, civil filings, Ho‘okele, and court hearings for these areas would be \ntransferred there, from downtown Honolulu. A dedicated and permanent staff of District Court \nClerks in Wahiawā would facilitate and streamline coverage for the ‘Ewa, Wai‘anae, and Wahiawā \nDistrict Court civil calendars—Wahiawā would be the hub. Restoring the funding for these \npositions will allow the West and Central O‘ahu court users to expeditiously access and attend \nDistrict Court business and enable the District Courts to facilitate and adjudicate cases in a more \nefficient manner. \nKona District Court Judge – The Judiciary requests $368,943 in FY 2026 and $360,048 in \nFY 2027, and 4.0 FTE permanent positions, for an additional District Court Judge and three \nnecessary support staff. The additional judgeship is needed to address the current extraordinary \ncaseload in Kona, as well as the continuing increases in complexity of cases and the time required \nto schedule and hear cases on the court calendars, and to improve public service and safety. The \nKona District Court is assigned to hear all District Court criminal, traffic, and civil matters for the \ndivisions of North Kona, South Kona, and Ka‘ū. The first Kona District Court Judge was sworn in \nnearly forty years ago. Since then, the combined population of North and South Kona and Ka‘ū \nhas more than doubled. The current caseload of the Kona District Court is nearly 16,000 cases \nannually, which are all currently being handled by one judge in one courtroom. This combination \nof factors has led to unsustainable court congestion and delays. \nCybersecurity and Technology – The Judiciary has three requests pertaining to \ncybersecurity and other technology.  \nFirst, is a request for $1,175,300 in FY 2026 and $1,175,300 in FY 2027 to upgrade email \nsubscriptions to improve security capabilities. The Judiciary currently uses Microsoft O365 for \nbasic email with multifactor authentication and basic threat detection and protection. With \ngovernment agencies and courts increasingly being targeted for cybersecurity attacks, this level of \nsecurity is no longer sufficient. Upgrading from O365 basic email to M365 G5 email would \nsignificantly enhance the Judiciary’s cybersecurity posture. M365 G5 email—the same level of \nthe State of Hawai‘i Executive Branch, which the Legislature funded during the 2024 Regular \nSession—includes robust cybersecurity features that address prevention, detection, investigation, \nand remediation of cybersecurity attacks on emails and Sharepoint data. \n\nHouse Bill No. 400, Relating to the Judiciary \n \nHouse Committee on Finance \n \nWednesday, March 5, 2025 \n \nPage 5  \n \n \nThe second cybersecurity-related request is for $458,224 in FYs 2026 and 2027 to restore \nfunding for four positions that have since been redescribed to a modern need—a dedicated \ncybersecurity staff. In addition, this funding would allow for additional tools required to manage \nthe Judiciary’s inventory of assets in an efficient and secure way. Specifically, this includes a suite \nthat can create strong access control, maintain a current inventory and patch the assets, and \nmaintain configuration baselines. \nThe third technology-focused request is for $560,000 in FY 2026 and $420,000 in FY 2027 \nto replace network switches in courthouses across the state that have reached their end-of-life. \nNetwork switches provide internet and phone connections to PCs, Cisco phones, printers, and \ncourtroom devices. They were last replaced between 2016 and 2018; the average useful lifespan \nis between five to eight years. As network switches age, network connections become unreliable \nand eventually become inoperable. A significant number of Judiciary courthouse network switches \nhave reached the end of their useful lifespan. \nCriminal Justice Research Institute (CJRI) – There are two requests related to the Criminal \nJustice Research Institute, established by Act 179 (SLH 2019). Both are to continue the resources \nappropriated in Act 147 (SLH 2023). More specifically, the first is $512,624 in FY 2026 and \n$577,058 in FY 2027, for a 1.0 FTE permanent Project Specialist position and software. Act 147 \n(SLH 2023) appropriated funds for a permanent Project Specialist and software/technology costs \nfor two years to begin to establish a centralized statewide criminal pretrial justice data reporting \nand collection system. Since then, CJRI has developed the foundation, including continuing to \ncreate a data warehouse and software tool that will modernize data sharing and create a centralized \nsource of pretrial data. CJRI has obtained 15 years of pretrial data from the Department of Law \nEnforcement, the Department of Attorney General, and the Judiciary, and has partnered with these \nagencies to begin mapping data to draft data pipelines. Staff have been trained with software to \ningest data into the data warehouse and established preliminary datasets for pretrial research. The \nProject Specialist position was created to support CJRI with in-house IT expertise. Although the \nposition is permanent, funding ends on June 30, 2025. To build upon this firm foundation, continue \nwork to establish a centralized statewide criminal pretrial justice data reporting and collection \nsystem, as well as continue to assess data and be available to inform policymakers, CJRI requires \nthat resources continue. \nThe second CJRI-related request is to continue 1.0 FTE temporary Project Specialist and \n$71,016 in both years of the biennium. In addition to the permanent position with two-year funding \ndescribed above, Act 147 (SLH 2023) authorized a temporary full-time Project Specialist position, \nalso with two-year funding ending on June 30, 2025. This position ensures that the Judiciary can \nfully support CJRI’s technical needs with a position in the Judiciary’s IT department focused on \nthe CJRI. As Judiciary data is ingested into the data warehouse, CJRI researchers need support \nfrom the Judiciary technical staff to ensure that the data is transformed into criminal pretrial data \nfor meaningful use for research. \nOffice of the Public Guardian (OPG) – The Judiciary requests $136,314 in FY 2026 and \n$125,424 in FY 2027, and 3.0 FTE permanent positions, for three Social Services Assistant IV \n\nHouse Bill No. 400, Relating to the Judiciary \n \nHouse Committee on Finance \n \nWednesday, March 5, 2025 \n \nPage 6  \n \n \npositions and related equipment for the Office of the Public Guardian. The positions will assist the \nThird Circuit (Hawai‘i County) and First Circuit (City and County of Honolulu) guardians. OPG \npersonnel are court-appointed to make informed decisions in the best interests of incapacitated \nindividuals by safeguarding their rights, dignity, humanity, and quality of life. When OPG is \nappointed as guardian, it comes with a myriad of challenges associated with researching and \nuntangling the ward’s unique situation. This work requires the guardians to work within many \nsystems and gain familiarity with each ward. The additional positions will be assigned medium \nand low priority tasks that are necessary but are often deferred because of urgent or emergent \ncircumstances for less stable wards. In addition, Social Services Assistants could improve safety \nwhen accompanying guardians in certain situations. Staff sometimes enter homes where other \nresidents who are not under OPG’s care are unstable. Guardians have experienced threats of \nviolence, dog bites, and other safety concerns. The Social Services Assistants would enable \nguardians to increase visits and care to all OPG wards. \nRisk Management Cost – The Judiciary requests $151,000 in FY 2026 and $151,000 in \nFY 2027 to cover an increase in the risk management costs owed to the Department of Accounting \nand General Services (DAGS). Pursuant to Comptroller Memoranda 1999-28 and 2007-05, and \nHRS § 41-D(4), DAGS bills the Judiciary annually for its share of the state’s risk management \ncosts which include insurance policy premiums. DAGS notified the Judiciary that its share of the \nrisk management costs would increase by approximately $151,000. \nTargeted Funding Restoration – The Judiciary’s next group of requests is to restore funding \nfor selected defunded positions. During the early part of the pandemic, over $11 million was \nremoved from the Judiciary’s budget for 192 vacant positions, to help the State’s economic crisis \nat that time. The Judiciary has continued to refine staffing statewide, including redescribing \npositions to modern needs and employing additional recruitment methods, particularly for \npositions where there have been recruiting difficulties. Nevertheless, these requests to restore \nfunding are for positions critical to operations now and going forward. Specifically: \n(1) \nCourts of Appeal \nRestored funding of $72,372 for FY 2026 and $72,372 in FY 2027 for a Judicial Assistant \nII at the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) would ensure necessary support to each judge of this \nCourt. There are positions for six Associate Judges in the ICA and one Chief Judge. Each judge \nhas a single Judicial Assistant II, and each position is imperative to the operations of the ICA. ICA \nJudicial Assistants use the Judiciary Information Management System (JIMS) and ICA internal \ndatabase, assist with hiring and personnel matters, assist in compiling reports and statistics, assist \nin training of Law Clerks and Staff Attorneys, provide coverage as needed for other Judicial \nAssistants and Appellate Clerks, assist with screening of cases for conflicts of interest, and \nundertake numerous housekeeping and institutional tasks that maintain the high standard and spirit \nof aloha that is the hallmark of the ICA. \n \n\nHouse Bill No. 400, Relating to the Judiciary \n \nHouse Committee on Finance \n \nWednesday, March 5, 2025 \n \nPage 7  \n \n \n(2) \nFirst Circuit  \nRestored funding of $47,004 in FY 2026 and $47,004 in FY 2027 for one position \nredescribed to a Judicial Clerk III. The shift in court operations to many virtual hearings has \nbenefitted court-users, but has strained staffing. This position, updated to a modern need, would \nhost remote hearings, process calendars for various case types, obtain and review efiled documents \nin traffic and criminal cases, and more. Existing staff have covered these responsibilities, \nsometimes leading to delays or backlogs in other sections. This is unsustainable. \nRestored funding of $105,816 in FY 2026 and $105,816 in FY 2027 for two hybrid District \nCourt Clerks IIs and Bailiffs. Two District Court Clerk positions will be redescribed to hybrid \nClerks and Bailiffs to increase flexibility to address court needs. Specifically, these hybrid \npositions would increase the Honolulu District Court’s capacity to meet needs in courtrooms, \nincluding processing witness certification fees and implementing in-court processing, which \nwould reduce delays in updating and processing the court record and delays in litigants’ ability to \nobtain case-related court dates. \n(3) \nSecond Circuit \nThe Judiciary requests restoration of a subtotal of $151,032 for both years of the biennium \nfor a District Court Clerk in Lahaina, a District Court Clerk in Wailuku, and an Account Clerk. \nThe District Court Clerk in Lahaina is responsible for the official court records in \narraignment and trial proceedings. This position issues disposition slips to the public as they \nconclude their proceedings, ensures documents are submitted and conformed to statutory and \nprocedural requirements, prepares warrants and orders pertaining to bail that may result in money \nbeing returned, and assists the public over the counter and over the telephone. This position is \nessential to rural courtroom services. \nThe Wailuku District Court Clerk position is necessary to normalize staffing levels and \nimprove service to the public. In this largest court facility in the county, inadequate staffing leads \nto delays and the inability to cover—as is often needed—rural courts that struggle with staffing. \nThe Account Clerk IV position provides critical support services to the Fiscal Office and \nthe public. This includes creating purchase orders and processing invoices. While each position is \nresponsible for a particular appropriation, the amount assigned to this defunded position has \nincreased by over 25% since FY 2021. Since this position was defunded, the Second Circuit’s \nFiscal Office assumed the responsibilities, thereby diverting focus from the Fiscal Office’s primary \nduties. \n(4) \nThird Circuit \nA key request in the Third Circuit is to restore $73,836 in FY 2026 and $73,836 in FY 2027 \nfor a Social Worker IV in the Kona Juvenile Client Services Branch. While this position was \n\nHouse Bill No. 400, Relating to the Judiciary \n \nHouse Committee on Finance \n \nWednesday, March 5, 2025 \n \nPage 8  \n \n \ndefunded early in the pandemic, Third Circuit decided to fill the position in March 2022 because \nthe remaining two staff were overwhelmed by attempting to address all informal status offenses, \nlaw violators, and school nonattendance referrals. The Third Circuit used resources from funded \nvacancies, fewer jury trials, and other areas to fund and fill this position at that time. Due to \nincreasing budget constraints, this is not sustainable without detrimental effects on other court \noperations. \nNext is a request to restore $57,192 in FY 2026 and $57,192 in FY 2027 for a Court \nDocuments Clerk III in the Hilo Legal Documents Branch. This position, among other duties, \nassists with Circuit and Family Court filings. This includes addressing time-sensitive filings, such \nas Temporary Restraining Orders (TROs), and assisting self-represented litigants (SRLs) at the \ncounter and over the phone. There has been a steady and significant increase in TROs filed in Hilo. \nIndeed, from 2019 to 2022, TRO filings in Hilo, particularly related to domestic abuse cases, have \nmore than doubled the amount in Kona. \nThe next request is to restore $47,004 in FY 2026 and $47,004 in FY 2027 for a Judicial \nClerk III position in the Kona Traffic Violations Branch. This section supports one District Court \nJudge that hears cases from the North and South Kona and Ka‘ū Districts. The vacancy of this \nposition has caused a backlog in creating citations in the Judiciary Information Management \nSystem (JIMS) and processing default judgments. Although some automation has made many \ntasks easier, automation in this unit has not offset added demands. The complexity of the legal \nprocess requires staff to articulate the information to self-represented litigants (SRLs) and process \nthe work accurately and efficiently. \nFinally, the Third Circuit requests to restore $52,908 in FY 2026 and $52,908 in FY 2027 \nfor an IT Support Technician III in Hilo. Third Circuit’s limited IT support must cover a large land \narea and three facilities. Indeed, these responsibilities are so important that the Third Circuit \nredescribed a defunded position into this IT Support Technician III and filled the position, using \ninternal funding from other areas available due to the COVID-19 pandemic leading to temporary \nshifts in operations. This is unsustainable without detrimental impacts to other operations. \n(5) \nAdministration \nRestored funding of $71,016 in FY 2026 and $71,016 in FY 2027 for a Purchasing and \nSpecifications Specialist in the Judiciary’s Financial Services Department. This position is in a \ndivision that is responsible for a high volume of purchasing, procurement, and contracts. Among \nother things, this division annually processes over 1,000 purchase requisitions, nearly 900 \ncontracts, and approximately 12 Competitive Sealed Bids and 17 Competitive Purchase of Service \nand Competitive Sealed Proposals solicitations. \nCapital Improvement Requests: \nCapital Improvement Project (CIP) requirements continue to remain a major item of \nconcern as the Judiciary’s infrastructure continues to age and deteriorate, and as the population \n\nHouse Bill No. 400, Relating to the Judiciary \n \nHouse Committee on Finance \n \nWednesday, March 5, 2025 \n \nPage 9  \n \n \nserved and services provided by the Judiciary continue to expand. We request CIP bond funds \ntotaling $11.9 million for FY 2026 to address critical needs, some of which relate to the health and \nsafety of Judiciary employees and the public.  \nSpecifically, the Judiciary is requesting $4.0 million to design a new South Kohala District \nCourthouse. The current South Kohala District Court carries significant concerns for safety, space, \ntemperature, noise, and is quite simply inadequate to serve the community’s court-related needs. \nThe Judiciary also requests $900,000 to replace an A/C chiller on Kaua‘i, at Pu‘uhonua Kaulike. \nThe chiller is near the end of its lifecycle, and A/C manufacturing is experiencing hardships \nresulting in long lead times.  \nThe Judiciary also requests $7.0 million in lump sum bond funds to address both continuing \nand emerging building issues statewide. As stated above, this includes $2.0 million that will be \ndirected to a shortfall in funding for relocation of the Children’s Justice Center on Oʻahu. The \nLegislature provided $6.0 million for that project in 2023. Since then, we have located a site and, \nalong with DAGS, are proceeding. While the final amount remains uncertain, the latest estimate \nis that the project cost will exceed $8.0 million. Accordingly we make this request for additional \nlump sum funds to maintain flexibility. \nThe Judiciary respectfully requests your support of House Bill No. 400, the Judiciary’s \nbiennium budget request. \nThank you for the opportunity to testify on this measure. \n\nJOSH GREEN, M.D.\n     GOVERNOR\nSTATE OF HAWAI`I\nDEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION\nKA ‘OIHANA HO‘ONA‘AUAO\nP.O.

Effective 7/1/2025.\nDepartment's Position:\nThe Hawai'i State Department of Education (Department) supports funding for the Judiciary for the \nfiscal biennium. The Department values its partnership with the District Family Court of the First \nCircuit in implementing its Early Elementary Intervention Program, which provides targeted support to \nfamilies and schools to improve attendance and reduce chronic absenteeism among elementary \nstudents on O'ahu.

TLC is a direct legal services provider, representing \nthose in Hawai‘i who meet income eligibility guidelines without regard to immigration status, national \norigin, ethnic background, race, religion, ideology, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, or disability. \nTLC works alongside immigrants so they can attain authorization to work and live with dignity, reunite \nwith their families after years of separation and escape horrific violence to find refuge in the United \nStates. TLC recognizes that every person needs and deserves to feel a sense of trust, welcome, and \nbelonging. \n \nTLC is a current grantee under the Judiciary’s civil legal services fund. The Judiciary’s civil legal services \nfund is critical to supporting safety net providers in Hawaii. TLC supports the current budget of $1.2 \nmillion and an increase of an additional $1 million to support the work of safety net providers in the \nlocal community. The needs of local safety net providers are continually growing. For example, with the \ncurrent federal administration’s immigration enforcement actions and rhetoric, TLC anticipates an \nexponential increase in those needing support in immigration proceedings.   \n \nThus, TLC supports the current budget of $1.2 million and an increase of an additional $1 million to the \nJudiciary’s civil legal services fund. Thank you for the opportunity to testify in support of HB400 and TLC \nrespectfully urges the Committee members to pass HB400 out of your Committee.

The civil legal services line item was initially intended for \nstatewide general civil legal service providers. Other important legal service providers are now \naccessing the funding, and we anticipate that more will apply. \n \nVolunteer Legal is concerned about all the federal actions limiting services to those residents \nwho need it the most. We are more worried than ever about the impact that the limiting of services has \non the safety net of legal services. There are many unmet needs1, and Volunteer Legal is often the last \nline of defense for someone facing critical issues, like landlord/tenant or child custody issues. \n \nIn the last forty-four years, Volunteer Legal has partnered with volunteer attorneys in the \nprovision of civil legal assistance to individuals and families of Hawaii. While Volunteer Legal \nServices Hawai‘i’s only office is on Oahu, we service residents of Hawai‘i statewide. In 2024, with \nonly a staff of 9, Volunteer Legal qualified around 1000 individuals. Volunteer Legal provides legal \ncheckups, educational presentations, clinics, brief services and/or full representations. Twenty-one \n(21%) of those helped are homeless or at the risk of being homeless, 28% of those helped suffer from \ndomestic violence, 6% of those helped were veterans, 26% of those helped are disabled, and 20% of \nthose helped were aged 60 and over. If not for Volunteer Legal Services Hawaii, these individuals \nwould have otherwise gone without legal help. \n \nVolunteer Legal Services Hawai‘i thanks the committee for the past support of legal services \nin the judiciary budget. We respectfully request your passage of H.B. 400. Thank you for this \nopportunity to provide testimony. \n \nSincerely, \nRachel Figueroa, Executive Director \n \n \n \n \n1According to the ALICE (Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed) report in 2022, in Hawaii alone, 11% of \nresidents were below the Federal Poverty Line (FPL), with 33% that earned above the Federal Poverty Line but not enough \nto afford the basics in the community where they live. https://unitedforalice.org/national-overview \n“Low-income Americans do not get any or enough legal help for 92% of their substantial civil legal problems.” \nhttps://justicegap.lsc.gov/resource/executive-summary/ \n \n \n70170 \n\n1100 Alakea Street, Suite 1000 • Honolulu, HI 96813 • Phone: (808) 537-1868 • Fax: (808) 521-7936 • http://HSBA.org \n \n \n \nOFFICERS \nMark M.

The State Judiciary plays a vital governmental role in upholding \na fair and civil society, yet it constitutes only about 2% of the overall State \nbudget. Community reports indicate a growing demand for judicial services \nin the current biennium.  It is our firm belief that the Judiciary has \ndemonstrated and continues to exhibit fiscal responsibility. Considering \nthese challenges, supporting the Judiciary's proposed biennium budget \nbecomes imperative to ensure its ability to meet the growing demands \nefficiently. \nThe Judiciary is tasked with some of the most important of all State \nresponsibilities. Individuals utilize court services during some of the most \nstressful times of their lives. Families rely on the Judiciary to settle disputes \nwhich tear at the fabric of their household. Business owners and \nentrepreneurs rely on the Judiciary to resolve contract or insurance issues \nwhich threaten their continued existence.  Individuals who have been \nwronged, intentionally or unintentionally, by others rely on the Judiciary to \nmake them whole. Those accused of crimes rely on the Judiciary to hear \ntheir “side of the story” and enforce speedy trial constitutional rights, and the \ngovernment must have an opportunity to present its case on behalf of the \npublic.   \nIt’s critical for the Legislature to provide sufficient support for the State \nJudiciary as provided in their budget request. Thank you for the opportunity \nto submit these comments in STRONG SUPPORT of HB 400. \n \nMahalo for this opportunity to provide testimony in support. \n\n \nTelephone: (808) 536-4302  Fax: (808) 527-8088 \nMailing Address: P.O.

Kyle T. Yamashita, Chair \nRep. Jenna Takenouchi, Vice-Chair \n \nWednesday, March 5, 2025 at 9:00 a.m. \nThe Legal Aid Society of Hawaii submits testimony in strong support of HB400–Relating to the \nJudiciary.  LASH supports the Judiciary’s overall budget priorities, as well as its continued \nadministration of funding for statewide civil legal services. \nHB400 contains a line-item for statewide civil legal services, which the Judiciary administers to \nthe State’s qualifying legal services providers to provide “general civil legal services without \ncharge to indigent residents of the State of Hawaiʻi.” This line-item is vital to meeting the needs \nof our residents statewide. \nIMPACT OF HB400 \nWith the support of this line-item, Legal Aid has been able to provide civil legal services to our \nlow-income and vulnerable populations across our state. As the state’s largest and oldest legal \nservice provider, we deliver legal services in the areas most needed by Hawaiʻi’s residents, \nincluding family law, housing, domestic abuse, consumer protection, immigration law, public \nbenefits, child welfare, and elder law. Legal Aid provides these services statewide through its 12 \noffices located in every county and on every island, as well as through our Maui Disaster Legal \nServices office and our Hawaiʻi Immigrant Justice Center. Our over 100 dedicated staff are all \ncommited to our mission of obtaining a fair and just Hawaiʻi for all. \nEach year, Legal Aid impacts the lives of approximately 20,000 Hawaiʻi residents. In the last fiscal \nyear, we received over 15,000 requests for assistance and were able to provide legal help in a little \nover 7000 cases in legal areas ranging from family, housing, consumer, foreclosure, public \nbenefits, elder law, homelessness, immigration, language access, and child welfare. Of those \nserved last year, over 2,000 of our clients were homeless or at risk for homelessness, over 1,600 \nare Native Hawaiian, over 1,200 experienced domestic violence and about 700 spoke a primary \nlanguage other than English.  \n \n \n LATE *Testimony submitted late may not be considered by the Committee for decision making purposes. \n\n \n \nNEED FOR INCREASED FUNDING \nWe are grateful for the legislature for their past and continuing support of general civil legal \nservices in the Judiciary budget, and to the Judiciary for providing a home for this program and \nadministering these important funds. However, more funding is urgently needed. \nIn Legal Services Corporation’s Justice Gap Report (2022), researchers found that “low-income \n[individuals] did not receive any or enough legal help for 92% of their civil legal problems[,]” \nand that Hawaiʻi is unfortunately consistent with this national average. More than one-half of \npeople nationwide have no confidence that they would be able to find a lawyer they could afford \nif they needed one. In Hawaiʻi, at least 72% of households had one or more civil legal problems \nin the past year. Current resources are not meeting our community’s needs: the National Justice \nIndex determined that nine times as many legal services attorneys and advocates are needed to \nmeet Hawaiʻi low-income residents’ legal needs. \n \nThere are now four legal service providers recieving this critical funding, and all of our low-\nincome and vulnerable populations statewide and across demographics are positively impacted \nby this support. We respectfully request that you increase support for legal services by adding an \nadditional $1,000,000 to the line item for legal services, which is an important part of the safety \nnet of social services that Hawaiʻi’s residents need.  \n \nWe are sensitive to the fact that the State is facing significant fiscal pressures due to potential \nfederal funding cuts. In addition, changes to the federal funding and policy landscape also \nrequire additional support for Hawaiʻi’s legal services providers. Recently, there have been \ndramatic reductions in available federal funds for victims of crime and domestic-violence \nsurvivors. Legal Aid receives substantial federal funds to provide services related to housing, \nassisting Hawaiʻi’s houseless communities, kūpuna legal services, health insurance navigators, \nand more, and is a clear preview of what’s to come. Disaster legal services, which includes over \none million in funding for Hawaiʻi, was also recently left out of the most recent funding \nresolution. And, it is likely that we will see attempts to drastically reduce funding for legal \nservices overall. \n \nThe Judiciary has been a leader in supporting “access to justice” initiatives here in Hawaiʻi, and \nhas generously provided a home for this line-item. Our ask is intended to supplement the \nJudiciary’s legislative priorities, and should not come at the expense of any priority or portion \nof the proposed budget. \n \nThank you for this opportunity to provide testimony. \n \nSincerely, \nDavid Kaulia Kopper  \nExecutive Director, Legal Aid Society of Hawaiʻi \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \nFirst Hawaiian Center \n \nT 808-539-0400 \n \n999 Bishop Street, Ste 1400  \nF 808-533-4945 \n \nHonolulu, HI 96813 \n \nDATE: \nMarch 5, 2025 \n \n \nTO: \n \n \nRepresentative Kyle Yamashita \nChair, Committee on Finance \nRepresentative Jenna Takenouchi \nVice Chair, Committee on Finance \nFROM: \nMihoko Ito \n \nRE: \nH.B. 400 HD1 - Relating to the Judiciary \nHearing Date: Wednesday, March 5, 2025 at 9:00 a.m. \nConference Room: 308 \n \n \nDear Chair Yamashita, Vice Chair Takenouchi, and Members of the Committee on \nFinance: \n \nThank you for the opportunity to submit testimony in strong support of the Judiciary \nBudget, H.B. 400 HD1. I am very supportive of the Judiciary and all of the work that \nthey do in and for our community.  I am also very much in support of the current line \nitem in the budget that supports funding for civil legal services (currently funded at \n$1.2M), but would respectfully request that the Committee consider increased the \namount by an additional $1M.  \n \nHaving worked on civil legal service provider funding for many years, I am aware \nthat civil legal service providers are chronically underfunded in our state and there is \na great amount of documented unmet need in the community.  With all the \nuncertainties at the federal level, this funding is more critical than ever. Legal service \nproviders are often the last line of defense protecting individuals from eviction, \ndeportation, homelessness, family separation and other barriers to basic survival in \nour community.  \n \nWe are very appreciative of the Legislature's support for civil legal services and the \nline item which was added to the Judiciary budget several years ago.  However, we \nwould like to note that, while this line item was historically for statewide general civil \nlegal services, under the current criteria it is now available for all civil legal services \nproviders. This change has ultimately diluted critical safety net funding, so we are \nasking for a $1M increase to support the critical work that these legal service \nprovider organizations provide. \n \nWe understand that with the current fiscal climate there are difficult budget decisions \nthat need to be made and the Legislature is also looking to fill in gaps in funding that \nmay occur due to federal funding issues.  We also do not wish for our request to \n LATE *Testimony submitted late may not be considered by the Committee for decision making purposes. \n\nPage 2 \nSanHi Government Strategies \na limited liability law partnership \nsupplant any of the Judiciary's other priorities, but respectfully ask that consideration \nbe given to increasing civil legal service providers funding. \n \nThank you for the opportunity to submit testimony in support of this bill.  \n \n \n \n \n"

Kimura \nPolicy and Planning Department Director \n \n \nBill No. and Title: House Bill No. 400, House Draft 1, Relating to the Judiciary. \nPurpose: Appropriates funds for the Judiciary for the 2025–2027 biennium. \nJudiciary’s Position: \nThe Judiciary strongly urges your support of House Bill No. 400, House Draft 1, which \nreflects the Judiciary’s resource requirements for Fiscal Biennium 2025–2027. \nBased on current circumstances and projected resource needs for the future, the Judiciary \nrequests additional operating resources in the amount of 17.0 permanent FTE and 1.0 temporary \nFTE, and $6.17M in FY 2026, and $6.25M in FY 2027. This is an addition of approximately 3% \nto the Judiciary’s operating budget. The Judiciary remains vigilant during this period of uncertainty \nover federal funding and the possible impact on the State and Judiciary budgets and operations. \nWe have assessed federally-funded grant projects of the Judiciary and are committed to ongoing \ncommunication with the Legislature and with local non-governmental partners of the Judiciary \nwho rely on federal funding. \nThe Judiciary also requests a total of $11.9M in bond funds for capital improvement \nprojects in FY 2026. This amount in bond funds, reflected in House Draft 1, includes a request for \n$2M more in lump sum than the measure as introduced. This is because the Judiciary received new \ninformation that the relocation of the Children’s Justice Center on O‘ahu will require at least $2M \nmore than previously appropriated. These circumstances are detailed further below, and the \n\nHouse Bill No. 400, House Draft 1, Relating to the Judiciary \n \nSenate Committee on Judiciary \n \nWednesday, March 19, 2025 \n \nPage 2  \n \n \nJudiciary appreciates both the House for including this additional amount in House Draft 1, and \nthis Senate Committee on Judiciary for considering this and previously including this in the \ncompanion measure, Senate Bill 260, Senate Draft 1. \nOperating Requests: \nOperating resource requests center around funding to make permanent or expand three \nSpecialty Courts on O‘ahu, to fully staff the new Wahiawā District Court that will open during this \nbiennium, an additional District Court Judge and support staff in Kona, cybersecurity and critical \ntechnology costs, funding for the Criminal Justice Research Institute (CJRI), and restoration of \nfunding for essential staffing that was defunded during the early part of the COVID-19 pandemic. \nAs for positions, nine of the 18 (17.0 permanent and 1.0 temporary) are requested to \ncontinue current staffing. This is because seven temporary positions for the Women’s Court Pilot \nProject, along with one permanent position and one temporary position for the CJRI, will expire, \nbut there are compelling reasons to continue these programs and the necessary staffing. The \nremaining requested positions will significantly expand capacity to certain operations. \nBrief details of each request are provided below: \nWomen’s Court – The Women’s Court Pilot Project was established by the Legislature in \nJuly of 2022 (Act 243/22) with funding for a three-year pilot that included seven temporary \npositions, which are set to expire at the end of FY 2025. The request of $705,416 in FY 2026 and \n$705,416 in FY 2027, and 8.0 FTE permanent positions will establish a permanent Women’s \nCourt. The Women’s Court, also known as Mohala Wahine, was created to address the rapid \ngrowth in the incarceration of women in the United States by providing comprehensive court-\nsupervised treatment, opportunities, and resources as an alternative to incarceration for women in \nthe criminal justice system who have suffered trauma, abuse, poverty, mental illness, substance \nuse disorders, and/or unhealthy relationships. The goal of the program is for the participants to \nidentify and address issues, to prevent re-entry into criminality, and to aid the participants in \nbettering their economic conditions and life circumstances. Given the need for the program, a \nstrong start as a three-year pilot created by the Legislature, and that the program (and positions \nand funding) will expire at the end of FY 2025, the Judiciary requests funding and eight positions \n(a net increase of one), including one substance use counselor. \nTruancy Court and Early Education Intervention Program (EEIP) – The Judiciary requests \nfunding of $188,388 in FY 2026 and $183,288 in FY 2027 to restore funding for three redescribed \nSocial Worker positions and additional expenses to significantly expand the Truancy Court and \nEEIP on O‘ahu. Truancy Court and EEIP are designed to identify and address, where possible, the \ndifficulties underlying chronic school truancy. The focus of Truancy Court is diversion from the \nformal court process. The bulk of the preventative work is done on the front-end to stop truancy \npetitions from being filed in court by addressing barriers to school attendance. To accomplish this, \nPersons in Need of Supervision (PINS) Social Workers visit campuses weekly to meet with \nstudents identified as having attendance issues. \n\nHouse Bill No. 400, House Draft 1, Relating to the Judiciary \n \nSenate Committee on Judiciary \n \nWednesday, March 19, 2025 \n \nPage 3  \n \n \nDriving While Impaired (DWI) Court Program – The Judiciary requests funding of \n$232,412 in FY 2026 and $237,612 in FY 2027 for two positions that will be redescribed to be a \nSocial Worker IV and Specialty Court Coordinator, and additional expenses, to make the DWI \nCourt Program permanent. The DWI Court Program was established in April 2012 and has been \noperational since January 2013, with initial federal funding for the program from the National \nHighway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) through a grant administered by the State \nDepartment of Transportation. The DWI Court Program confronts the persistent problem of \nimpaired driving and seeks to reduce recidivism among repeat and high-risk offenders by \naddressing the underlying cause of impaired driving, which is alcohol and/or substance use \ndisorder. Without intervention, this population of chronically impaired drivers might continue to \nreoffend and endanger public safety on our roadways. Securing permanent funding would allow \nthe DWI Court Program to continue, grow, and provide accountability and monitoring of the \ntreatment and recovery process for repeat and high-risk offenders. \nWahiawā District Court – There are five requests related to the Wahiawā District Court, \nwhich will open to the public in Spring 2026. The first relates to restoring funding for three \npositions in the amount of $192,408 in FY 2026 and $192,408 in FY 2027 to transition to a full \ncomplement of adult client services to the new Wahiawā District Court to support case \nmanagement of probation cases. The planned Adult Client Services Branch (ACSB) Wahiawā \nDistrict Court Unit will play a critical role in bringing court services to the community. When the \nACSB Wahiawā District Court Unit is operational, it will service an estimated 200 to 300 cases \nbased on the current clients that reside in the designated geographic areas: Waimea, Mililani, \nKunia, Whitmore Village, Waialua, Hale‘iwa, and Sunset. \nThe second request for Wahiawā District Court is for funding of $27,084 in FY 2026 (six \nmonths’ salary only) and $54,168 in FY 2027, and 1.0 FTE permanent position for a Janitor II. \nThe existing Wahiawā District Courthouse is in a rental space and janitorial services are covered \nby the lease. This position is necessary to support cleaning levels for the types of uses in the new \nfacility. For instance, the existing facility does not include a probation unit which performs drug \ntesting and will require additional cleaning.  This position is requested to provide the level of \ncleaning required to provide a clean and healthy environment for all who enter and use the facility. \nThe third request for Wahiawā District Court is funding of $346,209 in FY 2026 and \n$486,967 in FY 2027 to provide contracted security personnel for patrol, primarily interior. The \nnew courthouse will have two courtrooms and expand its services to include Ho‘okele (court \ninformation services), civil case processing, and probation services. Courthouse security for the \ncurrent location consists of two unarmed contracted private security personnel and one Deputy \nSheriff under the District Court Sheriff Command. To meet best practices, the new Wahiawā \nDistrict Court would need one sergeant and three Deputy Sheriffs assigned to patrol the new \nWahiawā District Court. Contracted security services could provide an alternative, albeit less than \noptimal. Funding this request would support this critical safety function. \nThe fourth request for Wahiawā District Court is to restore funding of $52,908 in FY 2026 \nand $52,908 in FY 2027 for a position redescribed to an IT Tech III and dedicated to this facility. \n\nHouse Bill No. 400, House Draft 1, Relating to the Judiciary \n \nSenate Committee on Judiciary \n \nWednesday, March 19, 2025 \n \nPage 4  \n \n \nThis IT Tech will provide support for courtroom video recording and video conferencing systems \nthat enable litigants to participate in court hearings remotely. The new Wahiawā District Court \nwill feature an additional courtroom, as well as an increased number of employees permanently \nbased there.  Since the pandemic, the First Circuit has permitted most District Court litigants to \nopt for remote hearing appearances by Zoom. At some hearings, dozens of litigants do so. A \nfunctioning courtroom AV system is therefore critical to the core operations of the court. \nThe fifth request for Wahiawā District Court is to restore funding of $317,448 in FY 2026 \nand $317,448 in FY 2027 for four District Court Clerk II and two Bailiff II positions. These \npositions, based in Wahiawā, will also support ‘Ewa and Wai‘anae District Courts, thereby \nenhancing the services available at these three rural courts. These positions provide courtroom \nclerical coverage for District Court criminal, civil, and traffic proceedings, and associated court \nclerical duties to record and facilitate cases throughout the court system. Upon opening and staffing \nof the Wahiawā District Court, civil filings, Ho‘okele, and court hearings for these areas would be \ntransferred there, from downtown Honolulu. A dedicated and permanent staff of District Court \nClerks in Wahiawā would facilitate and streamline coverage for the ‘Ewa, Wai‘anae, and Wahiawā \nDistrict Court civil calendars—Wahiawā would be the hub. Restoring the funding for these \npositions will allow the West and Central O‘ahu court users to expeditiously access and attend \nDistrict Court business and enable the District Courts to facilitate and adjudicate cases in a more \nefficient manner. \nKona District Court Judge – The Judiciary requests $368,943 in FY 2026 and $360,048 in \nFY 2027, and 4.0 FTE permanent positions, for an additional District Court Judge and three \nnecessary support staff. The additional judgeship is needed to address the current extraordinary \ncaseload in Kona, as well as the continuing increases in complexity of cases and the time required \nto schedule and hear cases on the court calendars, and to improve public service and safety. The \nKona District Court is assigned to hear all District Court criminal, traffic, and civil matters for the \ndivisions of North Kona, South Kona, and Ka‘ū. The first Kona District Court Judge was sworn in \nnearly forty years ago. Since then, the combined population of North and South Kona and Ka‘ū \nhas more than doubled. The current caseload of the Kona District Court is nearly 16,000 cases \nannually, which are all currently being handled by one judge in one courtroom. This combination \nof factors has led to unsustainable court congestion and delays. \nCybersecurity and Technology – The Judiciary has three requests pertaining to \ncybersecurity and other technology.  \nFirst, is a request for $1,175,300 in FY 2026 and $1,175,300 in FY 2027 to upgrade email \nsubscriptions to improve security capabilities. The Judiciary currently uses Microsoft O365 for \nbasic email with multifactor authentication and basic threat detection and protection. With \ngovernment agencies and courts increasingly being targeted for cybersecurity attacks, this level of \nsecurity is no longer sufficient. Upgrading from O365 basic email to M365 G5 email would \nsignificantly enhance the Judiciary’s cybersecurity posture. M365 G5 email—the same level of \nthe State of Hawai‘i Executive Branch, which the Legislature funded during the 2024 Regular \n\nHouse Bill No. 400, House Draft 1, Relating to the Judiciary \n \nSenate Committee on Judiciary \n \nWednesday, March 19, 2025 \n \nPage 5  \n \n \nSession—includes robust cybersecurity features that address prevention, detection, investigation, \nand remediation of cybersecurity attacks on emails and Sharepoint data. \nThe second cybersecurity-related request is for $458,224 in FYs 2026 and 2027 to restore \nfunding for four positions that have since been redescribed to a modern need—a dedicated \ncybersecurity staff. In addition, this funding would allow for additional tools required to manage \nthe Judiciary’s inventory of assets in an efficient and secure way. Specifically, this includes a suite \nthat can create strong access control, maintain a current inventory and patch the assets, and \nmaintain configuration baselines. \nThe third technology-focused request is for $560,000 in FY 2026 and $420,000 in FY 2027 \nto replace network switches in courthouses across the state that have reached their end-of-life. \nNetwork switches provide internet and phone connections to PCs, Cisco phones, printers, and \ncourtroom devices. They were last replaced between 2016 and 2018; the average useful lifespan \nis between five to eight years. As network switches age, network connections become unreliable \nand eventually become inoperable. A significant number of Judiciary courthouse network switches \nhave reached the end of their useful lifespan. \nCriminal Justice Research Institute (CJRI) – There are two requests related to the Criminal \nJustice Research Institute, established by Act 179 (SLH 2019). Both are to continue the resources \nappropriated in Act 147 (SLH 2023). More specifically, the first is $512,624 in FY 2026 and \n$577,058 in FY 2027, for a 1.0 FTE permanent Project Specialist position and software. Act 147 \n(SLH 2023) appropriated funds for a permanent Project Specialist and software/technology costs \nfor two years to begin to establish a centralized statewide criminal pretrial justice data reporting \nand collection system. Since then, CJRI has developed the foundation, including continuing to \ncreate a data warehouse and software tool that will modernize data sharing and create a centralized \nsource of pretrial data. CJRI has obtained 15 years of pretrial data from the Department of Law \nEnforcement, the Department of Attorney General, and the Judiciary, and has partnered with these \nagencies to begin mapping data to draft data pipelines. Staff have been trained with software to \ningest data into the data warehouse and established preliminary datasets for pretrial research. The \nProject Specialist position was created to support CJRI with in-house IT expertise. Although the \nposition is permanent, funding ends on June 30, 2025. To build upon this firm foundation, continue \nwork to establish a centralized statewide criminal pretrial justice data reporting and collection \nsystem, as well as continue to assess data and be available to inform policymakers, CJRI requires \nthat resources continue. \nThe second CJRI-related request is to continue 1.0 FTE temporary Project Specialist and \n$71,016 in both years of the biennium. In addition to the permanent position with two-year funding \ndescribed above, Act 147 (SLH 2023) authorized a temporary full-time Project Specialist position, \nalso with two-year funding ending on June 30, 2025. This position ensures that the Judiciary can \nfully support CJRI’s technical needs with a position in the Judiciary’s IT department focused on \nthe CJRI. As Judiciary data is ingested into the data warehouse, CJRI researchers need support \nfrom the Judiciary technical staff to ensure that the data is transformed into criminal pretrial data \nfor meaningful use for research. \n\nHouse Bill No. 400, House Draft 1, Relating to the Judiciary \n \nSenate Committee on Judiciary \n \nWednesday, March 19, 2025 \n \nPage 6  \n \n \nOffice of the Public Guardian (OPG) – The Judiciary requests $136,314 in FY 2026 and \n$125,424 in FY 2027, and 3.0 FTE permanent positions, for three Social Services Assistant IV \npositions and related equipment for the Office of the Public Guardian. The positions will assist the \nThird Circuit (Hawai‘i County) and First Circuit (City and County of Honolulu) guardians. OPG \npersonnel are court-appointed to make informed decisions in the best interests of incapacitated \nindividuals by safeguarding their rights, dignity, humanity, and quality of life. When OPG is \nappointed as guardian, it comes with a myriad of challenges associated with researching and \nuntangling the ward’s unique situation. This work requires the guardians to work within many \nsystems and gain familiarity with each ward. The additional positions will be assigned medium \nand low priority tasks that are necessary but are often deferred because of urgent or emergent \ncircumstances for less stable wards. In addition, Social Services Assistants could improve safety \nwhen accompanying guardians in certain situations. Staff sometimes enter homes where other \nresidents who are not under OPG’s care are unstable. Guardians have experienced threats of \nviolence, dog bites, and other safety concerns. The Social Services Assistants would enable \nguardians to increase visits and care to all OPG wards. \nRisk Management Cost – The Judiciary requests $151,000 in FY 2026 and $151,000 in \nFY 2027 to cover an increase in the risk management costs owed to the Department of Accounting \nand General Services (DAGS). Pursuant to Comptroller Memoranda 1999-28 and 2007-05, and \nHRS § 41-D(4), DAGS bills the Judiciary annually for its share of the state’s risk management \ncosts which include insurance policy premiums. DAGS notified the Judiciary that its share of the \nrisk management costs would increase by approximately $151,000. \nTargeted Funding Restoration – The Judiciary’s next group of requests is to restore funding \nfor selected defunded positions. During the early part of the pandemic, over $11 million was \nremoved from the Judiciary’s budget for 192 vacant positions, to help the State’s economic crisis \nat that time. The Judiciary has continued to refine staffing statewide, including redescribing \npositions to modern needs and employing additional recruitment methods, particularly for \npositions where there have been recruiting difficulties. Nevertheless, these requests to restore \nfunding are for positions critical to operations now and going forward. Specifically: \n(1) \nCourts of Appeal \nRestored funding of $72,372 for FY 2026 and $72,372 in FY 2027 for a Judicial Assistant \nII at the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) would ensure necessary support to each judge of this \nCourt. There are positions for six Associate Judges in the ICA and one Chief Judge. Each judge \nhas a single Judicial Assistant II, and each position is imperative to the operations of the ICA. ICA \nJudicial Assistants use the Judiciary Information Management System (JIMS) and ICA internal \ndatabase, assist with hiring and personnel matters, assist in compiling reports and statistics, assist \nin training of Law Clerks and Staff Attorneys, provide coverage as needed for other Judicial \nAssistants and Appellate Clerks, assist with screening of cases for conflicts of interest, and \nundertake numerous housekeeping and institutional tasks that maintain the high standard and spirit \nof aloha that is the hallmark of the ICA. \n\nHouse Bill No. 400, House Draft 1, Relating to the Judiciary \n \nSenate Committee on Judiciary \n \nWednesday, March 19, 2025 \n \nPage 7  \n \n \n \n(2) \nFirst Circuit  \nRestored funding of $47,004 in FY 2026 and $47,004 in FY 2027 for one position \nredescribed to a Judicial Clerk III. The shift in court operations to many virtual hearings has \nbenefitted court-users, but has strained staffing. This position, updated to a modern need, would \nhost remote hearings, process calendars for various case types, obtain and review efiled documents \nin traffic and criminal cases, and more. Existing staff have covered these responsibilities, \nsometimes leading to delays or backlogs in other sections. This is unsustainable. \nRestored funding of $105,816 in FY 2026 and $105,816 in FY 2027 for two hybrid District \nCourt Clerks IIs and Bailiffs. Two District Court Clerk positions will be redescribed to hybrid \nClerks and Bailiffs to increase flexibility to address court needs. Specifically, these hybrid \npositions would increase the Honolulu District Court’s capacity to meet needs in courtrooms, \nincluding processing witness certification fees and implementing in-court processing, which \nwould reduce delays in updating and processing the court record and delays in litigants’ ability to \nobtain case-related court dates. \n(3) \nSecond Circuit \nThe Judiciary requests restoration of a subtotal of $151,032 for both years of the biennium \nfor a District Court Clerk in Lahaina, a District Court Clerk in Wailuku, and an Account Clerk. \nThe District Court Clerk in Lahaina is responsible for the official court records in \narraignment and trial proceedings. This position issues disposition slips to the public as they \nconclude their proceedings, ensures documents are submitted and conformed to statutory and \nprocedural requirements, prepares warrants and orders pertaining to bail that may result in money \nbeing returned, and assists the public over the counter and over the telephone. This position is \nessential to rural courtroom services. \nThe Wailuku District Court Clerk position is necessary to normalize staffing levels and \nimprove service to the public. In this largest court facility in the county, inadequate staffing leads \nto delays and the inability to cover—as is often needed—rural courts that struggle with staffing. \nThe Account Clerk IV position provides critical support services to the Fiscal Office and \nthe public. This includes creating purchase orders and processing invoices. While each position is \nresponsible for a particular appropriation, the amount assigned to this defunded position has \nincreased by over 25% since FY 2021. Since this position was defunded, the Second Circuit’s \nFiscal Office assumed the responsibilities, thereby diverting focus from the Fiscal Office’s primary \nduties. \n \n\nHouse Bill No. 400, House Draft 1, Relating to the Judiciary \n \nSenate Committee on Judiciary \n \nWednesday, March 19, 2025 \n \nPage 8  \n \n \n(4) \nThird Circuit \nA key request in the Third Circuit is to restore $73,836 in FY 2026 and $73,836 in FY 2027 \nfor a Social Worker IV in the Kona Juvenile Client Services Branch. While this position was \ndefunded early in the pandemic, Third Circuit decided to fill the position in March 2022 because \nthe remaining two staff were overwhelmed by attempting to address all informal status offenses, \nlaw violators, and school nonattendance referrals. The Third Circuit used resources from funded \nvacancies, fewer jury trials, and other areas to fund and fill this position at that time. Due to \nincreasing budget constraints, this is not sustainable without detrimental effects on other court \noperations. \nNext is a request to restore $57,192 in FY 2026 and $57,192 in FY 2027 for a Court \nDocuments Clerk III in the Hilo Legal Documents Branch. This position, among other duties, \nassists with Circuit and Family Court filings. This includes addressing time-sensitive filings, such \nas Temporary Restraining Orders (TROs), and assisting self-represented litigants (SRLs) at the \ncounter and over the phone. There has been a steady and significant increase in TROs filed in Hilo. \nIndeed, from 2019 to 2022, TRO filings in Hilo, particularly related to domestic abuse cases, have \nmore than doubled the amount in Kona. \nThe next request is to restore $47,004 in FY 2026 and $47,004 in FY 2027 for a Judicial \nClerk III position in the Kona Traffic Violations Branch. This section supports one District Court \nJudge that hears cases from the North and South Kona and Ka‘ū Districts. The vacancy of this \nposition has caused a backlog in creating citations in the Judiciary Information Management \nSystem (JIMS) and processing default judgments. Although some automation has made many \ntasks easier, automation in this unit has not offset added demands. The complexity of the legal \nprocess requires staff to articulate the information to self-represented litigants (SRLs) and process \nthe work accurately and efficiently. \nFinally, the Third Circuit requests to restore $52,908 in FY 2026 and $52,908 in FY 2027 \nfor an IT Support Technician III in Hilo. Third Circuit’s limited IT support must cover a large land \narea and three facilities. Indeed, these responsibilities are so important that the Third Circuit \nredescribed a defunded position into this IT Support Technician III and filled the position, using \ninternal funding from other areas available due to the COVID-19 pandemic leading to temporary \nshifts in operations. This is unsustainable without detrimental impacts to other operations. \n(5) \nAdministration \nRestored funding of $71,016 in FY 2026 and $71,016 in FY 2027 for a Purchasing and \nSpecifications Specialist in the Judiciary’s Financial Services Department. This position is in a \ndivision that is responsible for a high volume of purchasing, procurement, and contracts. Among \nother things, this division annually processes over 1,000 purchase requisitions, nearly 900 \ncontracts, and approximately 12 Competitive Sealed Bids and 17 Competitive Purchase of Service \nand Competitive Sealed Proposals solicitations. \n\nHouse Bill No. 400, House Draft 1, Relating to the Judiciary \n \nSenate Committee on Judiciary \n \nWednesday, March 19, 2025 \n \nPage 9  \n \n \nCapital Improvement Requests: \nCapital Improvement Project (CIP) requirements continue to remain a major item of \nconcern as the Judiciary’s infrastructure continues to age and deteriorate, and as the population \nserved and services provided by the Judiciary continue to expand. We request CIP bond funds \ntotaling $11.9 million for FY 2026 to address critical needs, some of which relate to the health and \nsafety of Judiciary employees and the public.  \nSpecifically, the Judiciary is requesting $4.0 million to design a new South Kohala District \nCourthouse. The current South Kohala District Court carries significant concerns for safety, space, \ntemperature, noise, and is quite simply inadequate to serve the community’s court-related needs. \nThe Judiciary also requests $900,000 to replace an A/C chiller on Kaua‘i, at Pu‘uhonua Kaulike. \nThe chiller is near the end of its lifecycle, and A/C manufacturing is experiencing hardships \nresulting in long lead times.  \nThe Judiciary also requests $7.0 million in lump sum bond funds to address both continuing \nand emerging building issues statewide. As stated above, this includes $2.0 million that will be \ndirected to a shortfall in funding for relocation of the Children’s Justice Center on Oʻahu. The \nLegislature provided $6.0 million for that project in 2023. Since then, we have located a site and, \nalong with DAGS, are proceeding. While the final amount remains uncertain, the latest estimate \nis that the project cost will exceed $8.0 million. Accordingly we make this request for additional \nlump sum funds to maintain flexibility. \nThe Judiciary respectfully requests your support of House Bill No. 400, House Draft 1, the \nJudiciary’s biennium budget request. \nThank you for the opportunity to testify on this measure. \n\n \n \n \n \n \nThe Judiciary, State of Hawai‘i \n \nTestimony to the Thirty-Third Legislature, 2025 Regular Session \n \nSenate Committee on Judiciary \nSenator Karl Rhoads, Chair \nSenator Mike Gabbard, Vice Chair \n \nWednesday, March 19, 2025, 9:45 a.m. \nState Capitol, Conference Room 016 \n \nby \nRobert D. S. Kim \nChief Court Administrator \nThird Circuit Court \n \n \nBill No. and Title: House Bill No. 400, H.D.1, Relating to the Judiciary \n \nPurpose: Appropriates funds for the Judiciary for the fiscal biennium beginning 7/1/2025, and \nending 6/30/2027. Effective 7/1/3000. (HD1) \n \nJudiciary's Position:  \nOn behalf of the Third Circuit, I am writing to respectfully request your support for House \nBill 400, H.D.1, also known as the Judiciary Appropriations Act of 2025. This bill would \nappropriate funds for two critical budget requests for the Third Circuit: design funds for a new \nSouth Kohala district court facility and funding for a second district court judge in Kona. \nThe Capital Improvement Project Request (“CIP”) for plans and a design for a new South \nKohala District Courthouse is included in this bill in accordance with House Concurrent \nResolution No. 88, Regular Session of 2023, which requested that the Judiciary prepare a master \ndevelopment plan and submit a CIP for an upgraded South Kohala District Court. This CIP will \naddress critical deficiencies in the existing courthouse, meet the current and future needs of the \nNorth Hawaiʻi community, and ensure that the Judiciary is able to carry out its mission to deliver \njustice in an efficient and accessible manner. \nThe current South Kohala District Court building was constructed in 1982. According to \n2020 census data, the population of the North and South Kohala Districts served by the existing \nfacility has increased by 230% since 1980. This population growth has driven a significant rise in \n\nHouse Bill No. 400, H.D. 1, Relating to the Judiciary \nSenate Committee on Judiciary \n \nWednesday, March 19, 2025 \n \nPage 2  \n \n \n \ncase volume, with the court now handling between 9,000 and 10,000 cases annually. Despite this \nheavy caseload, the current courthouse is only 3,000 square feet, with one courtroom, minimal \noffice space, and no meeting rooms or waiting areas. Its size and design are severely inadequate, \nand often up to 50 individuals are forced to wait for their court hearings in their vehicles or outside \nin uncovered areas, exposed to the elements. The facility is also not ADA compliant, leading to \nhardships for disabled individuals—particularly with respect to restroom access.    \nSecurity is a paramount concern. The existing facility lacks separate entrances for judges \nand court staff, as well as secure, separate waiting areas for opposing parties in sensitive cases, \nsuch as temporary restraining orders (“TROs”). This creates the potential for dangerous \ninteractions. Because there are no holdings areas in the courthouse, in-custody defendants must \nremain in the jail van until their case is called, forcing defense attorneys to meet their clients in the \nvan. \nThe new South Kohala District Court facility will comprehensively address the many \ndeficiencies of the existing courthouse. It will be constructed on the Waimea Civic Center \ngrounds—the same state-owned parcel where the current facility is located—which will eliminate \nadditional land acquisition costs. It will feature expanded office space, secure holding areas, \nseparate waiting areas for opposing parties, and ADA-compliant restrooms. Client services, which \nare currently located off-site, will be integrated into the facility, and modern infrastructure and \nenergy-efficient systems will ensure sustainable operations. Importantly, the existing courthouse \nwill remain operational throughout construction, ensuring uninterrupted services.  \n \nIn addition to this CIP request, the appropriations for the Third Circuit’s operating budget \nin this bill includes funding for a second district court judge in Kona, as well as support staff. This \nfunding request arises from a critical and urgent need to address the severe strain on the Kona \nDistrict Court, where a single judge currently bears the immense responsibility of handling nearly \n16,000 individual cases annually. This unsustainable situation jeopardizes the Judiciary’s ability \nto fulfill its core mission to administer justice in an impartial, efficient, and accessible manner. \nThe population of the districts served by this court has nearly tripled since the first Kona \nDistrict Court Judge was sworn in nearly 40 years ago. Judicial resources have not kept pace with \nthis explosive growth, and despite the increase in population, the Kona District Court continues to \nrely on a single judge. This has created untenable caseloads that overwhelm court operations and \nhinder the court’s ability to effectively serve the public.  \nFor example, traffic court calendars routinely exceed 70 individual defendants in a single \nmorning, and litigants are frequently obliged to wait hours—sometimes over lunch and into the \nafternoon—for their cases to be heard. Court sessions often run from 8:30 a.m. until the close of \nbusiness without a substantial break for the judge or court staff. District Court staff often must \nalternate lunch breaks to keep hearings running uninterrupted, and attorneys, public defenders, \nprosecutors, and litigants are also subjected to these grueling schedules, which take a toll on their \nhealth, morale, and efficiency. Resulting delays in hearings and case resolutions have undermined \n\nHouse Bill No. 400, H.D. 1, Relating to the Judiciary \nSenate Committee on Judiciary \n \nWednesday, March 19, 2025 \n \nPage 3  \n \n \n \ntrust in the judicial system and can create significant personal and financial hardships for victims, \nwitnesses, and litigants. This relentless pace also compromises the judge’s ability to address other \ncritical judicial duties, such as reviewing search warrants, making judicial determinations of \nprobable cause, and, most concerningly, processing applications for TROs.  \nThe cascade of inefficiencies that follows from a lack of sufficient judicial resources \nundermines the quality of justice delivered by the Kona District Court. One judge, no matter how \ndedicated, cannot sustainably balance the competing demands of timeliness and thoroughness \nunder the current circumstances. The immense pressure on staff, attorneys, and litigants is \ndemoralizing, leads to burnout, and diminishes the public’s confidence in the Judiciary. \nThe addition of a second District Court Judge in Kona is the only viable solution to this \nurgent crisis. The Judiciary has sponsored pending legislation that would establish one additional \ndistrict court judge position in the Third Circuit (H.B. 401, H.D.1 and S.B. 267) concurrently with \nthis appropriations bill. Moreover, as there is currently a vacant District Court courtroom at the \nKeahuolū Courthouse, the addition of a second District Court Judge will not require any additional \ncapital improvement costs. A second judge would not only reduce individual caseloads, but also \nallow the court to operate more efficiently, dispose of cases more promptly, and provide litigants \nand victims with the timely and equitable justice they deserve.  \nI respectfully ask for your consideration and support in approving the Judiciary \nAppropriations Act of 2025 that includes these critical appropriations for the Third Circuit. Thank \nyou for your commitment to strengthening our judicial system and addressing the pressing needs \nof the Third Circuit and our Hawaiʻi Island community, and thank you for the opportunity to offer \ntestimony on this important bill. \n \n\n \n \nSouth Kohala District Court Photos \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nLeft: Depicts the only waiting area for the public, which is located outside.

The civil legal services line item was initially intended for \nstatewide general civil legal service providers. Other important legal service providers are also \naccessing the line item, and we anticipate that more will apply. \n \nVolunteer Legal is concerned about all the federal actions limiting services to those residents \nwho need it the most.  We are more worried than ever about the impact that the limiting of services has \non the safety net of legal services. There are many unmet needs1, and Volunteer Legal is often the last \nline of defense for someone facing critical issues, like landlord/tenant or child custody issues.  \n \n In the last forty-four years, Volunteer Legal has partnered with volunteer attorneys in the \nprovision of civil legal assistance to individuals and families of Hawaii.  While Volunteer Legal \nServices Hawai‘i’s only office is on Oahu, we service residents of Hawai‘i statewide.  In 2024, with \nonly a staff of 9, Volunteer Legal qualified around 1000 individuals. Volunteer Legal provides legal \ncheckups, educational presentations, clinics, brief services and/or full representations.  Twenty-one \n(21%) of those helped are homeless or at the risk of being homeless, 28% of those helped suffer from \ndomestic violence, 6% of those helped were veterans, 26% of those helped are disabled, and 20% of \nthose helped were aged 60 and over.  If not for Volunteer Legal Services Hawai‘i, these individuals \nwould have otherwise gone without legal help.   \n \nOur request is not intended to supplant any of the Judiciary’s other priorities. Volunteer Legal \nServices Hawai‘i thanks the committee for the past support of legal services in the judiciary budget. \nWe respectfully request your passage of H.B. 400, HD1.  Thank you for this opportunity to provide \ntestimony.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSincerely,  \nRachel Figueroa, Executive Director \n \n \n \n1According to the ALICE (Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed) report in 2022, in Hawaii alone, 11% of \nresidents were below the Federal Poverty Line (FPL), with 33% that earned above the Federal Poverty Line but not enough \nto afford the basics in the community where they live.  https://unitedforalice.org/national-overview \n“Low-income Americans do not get any or enough legal help for 92% of their substantial civil legal problems.” \nhttps://justicegap.lsc.gov/resource/executive-summary/ \n\n \nMakiki: 1020 South Beretania St., Honolulu, Hawai‘i  96814     Downtown: 1188 Bishop St., Ste 3209, Honolulu, HI 96813 \nwww.tlchawaii.org    (808) 777-7071    fax (808) 930-0969 \n \nStatement Before The \nWednesday, March 19, 2025 \n9:45 AM \nConference Room 016 & Videoconference \n \nin consideration of \nHB400, HD1 \n \nRELATING TO JUDICIARY. \n \nChair RHOADS, Vice Chair GABBARD, and Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee \n \nThe Legal Clinic (TLC) supports HB400, HD1, which appropriates funds for the Judiciary for the fiscal \nbiennium beginning 7/1/2025, and ending 6/30/2027. \n \nTLC is a Hawai‘i nonprofit, nonpartisan organization. TLC is a direct legal services provider, representing \nthose in Hawai‘i who meet income eligibility guidelines without regard to immigration status, national \norigin, ethnic background, race, religion, ideology, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, or disability. \nTLC works alongside immigrants so they can attain authorization to work and live with dignity, reunite \nwith their families after years of separation and escape horrific violence to find refuge in the United \nStates. TLC recognizes that every person needs and deserves to feel a sense of trust, welcome, and \nbelonging. \n \nTLC is a current grantee under the Judiciary’s civil legal services fund. The Judiciary’s civil legal services \nfund is critical to supporting safety net providers in Hawaii. TLC supports the current budget of $1.2 \nmillion and an increase of an additional $1 million to support the work of safety net providers in the \nlocal community. The needs of local safety net providers are continually growing. For example, with the \ncurrent federal administration’s immigration enforcement actions and rhetoric, TLC is expecting a surge \nin Hawai‘i immigration court cases. TLC is already experiencing an increased demand for pro bono legal \nimmigration services. \n \nThus, TLC supports the current budget of $1.2 million and an increase of an additional $1 million to the \nJudiciary’s civil legal services fund. TLC additionally respectfully requests funding of $750,000 to provide \naccess for legal representation to individuals in immigration-related proceedings in immigration court, \nincluding deportation defense, asylum applications, and other immigration relief processes, ensuring \ndue process and promoting family unity, community stability, and economic security. TLC notes that our \nrequests should not supplant any of the Judiciary’s budget priorities. \n \nThank you for the opportunity to testify in support of HB400, HD1, and TLC respectfully urges the \nCommittee members to pass HB400 , HD1 out of your Committee.

Murakami, HSBA President \n \nRE:  \nHB 400, HD1 - RELATING TO THE JUDICIARY \n \n \nChair Rhoads, Vice Chair Gabbard, and Members of the Senate Committee \non Judiciary: \nThe Hawaii State Bar Association (HSBA) appreciates the opportunity to \noffer testimony in STRONG SUPPORT of HB 400, HD1 – RELATING TO \nTHE JUDICIARY.  The State Judiciary plays a vital governmental role in \nupholding a fair and civil society, yet it constitutes only about 2% of the \noverall State budget. Community reports indicate a growing demand for \njudicial services in the current biennium.  It is our firm belief that the Judiciary \nhas demonstrated and continues to exhibit fiscal responsibility. Considering \nthese challenges, supporting the Judiciary's proposed biennium budget \nbecomes imperative to ensure its ability to meet the growing demands \nefficiently. \nThe Judiciary is tasked with some of the most important of all State \nresponsibilities. Individuals utilize court services during some of the most \nstressful times of their lives. Families rely on the Judiciary to settle disputes \nwhich tear at the fabric of their household. Business owners and \nentrepreneurs rely on the Judiciary to resolve contract or insurance issues \nwhich threaten their continued existence.  Individuals who have been \nwronged, intentionally or unintentionally, by others rely on the Judiciary to \nmake them whole. Those accused of crimes rely on the Judiciary to hear \ntheir “side of the story” and enforce speedy trial constitutional rights, and the \ngovernment must have an opportunity to present its case on behalf of the \npublic.   \nIt’s critical for the Legislature to provide sufficient support for the State \nJudiciary as provided in their budget request. Thank you for the opportunity \nto submit these comments in STRONG SUPPORT of HB 400, HD1. \n \nMahalo for this opportunity to provide testimony in support. \n\nHB-400-HD-1 \nSubmitted on: 3/18/2025 9:07:44 AM \nTestimony for JDC on 3/19/2025 9:45:00 AM \nSubmitted By \nOrganization \nTestifier Position \nTestify \nSanHi Government \nStrategies  \nIndividual \nSupport \nIn Person \n \n \nComments:  \nAloha Chair Rhaods, Vice Chair Gabbard and members of the Committee:  \nThank you for the opportunity to submit testimony in strong support of the Judiciary Budget, HB \n400.  I am very supportive of the Judiciary and all of the work that they do in and for our \ncommunity.  I am also very much in support of the current line item in the budget that supports \nfunding for civil legal services (currently funded at $1.2M), but would respectfully request that \nthe amount be increased by and additional $1M.  \nHaving worked on civil legal service provider funding for many years, I am aware that civil legal \nservice providers are chronically underfunded in our state and there is a great amount of \ndocumented unmet need in the community.  With all the uncertainties at the federal level, this \nfunding is more critical than ever. Legal service providers are often the last line of defense \nprotecting individuals from eviction, deportation, homelessness, family separation and other \nbarriers to basic survival in our community.  \nWe are very appreciative of the Legislature's support for civil legal services and the recurring \nline item which was added to the Judiciary budget several years ago.  However, we would like to \nnote that, while this line item was historically for statewide general civil legal services, under the \ncurrent criteria it is now available for all civil legal services providers. This change has \nultimately diluted critical safety net funding, so we are asking for a $1M increase to support the \ncritical work that these legal service provider organizations provide. \nI do not wish for our request to supplant any of the Judiciary's other priorities, but respectfully \nask that consideration be given to increasing civil legal service providers funding. \nGiven these uncertain times, we are grateful for any support the legislature can provide on this \nimportant issue.  Thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony in support of this bill.  \nRespectfully,  \nMihoko Ito  \n \n\nHB-400-HD-1 \nSubmitted on: 3/18/2025 9:02:14 PM \nTestimony for JDC on 3/19/2025 9:45:00 AM \nSubmitted By \nOrganization \nTestifier Position \nTestify \nDavid Keith Kauila \nKopper \nTestifying for Legal aid \nsociety of Hawaii \nSupport \nRemotely Via \nZoom \n \n \nComments:  \nLegal Aid Society of Hawaii supports this measure.    \n \n\nHB-400-HD-1 \nSubmitted on: 3/19/2025 4:30:15 AM \nTestimony for JDC on 3/19/2025 9:45:00 AM \nSubmitted By \nOrganization \nTestifier Position \nTestify \nJoseph E Cardoza \nIndividual \nSupport \nWritten Testimony \nOnly \n \n \nComments:  \nChair:            Hon.

Specifically, I am in support of the base budget line item for \nthe purchase of civil legal services and also support an increase of one million dollars in funding \nfor that line item. \n  \n    Several non-profit organizations provide critical civil legal services to persons  and families \nwho cannot afford a lawyer.  The inability to access essential civil legal services often leads to \ncostly long-term consequences.  The impact on the community is both social and \neconomic.  Legal services provided today to address problems associated with eviction, \nhomelessness, deportation, family separation, and educational needs reduces the likelihood of \nspending far greater sums in the future to remedy serious problems caused by a lack of access to \ncivil legal services.  Furthermore, the drastic cuts in federal funding make it all the more critical \nthat funds be appropriated to provide essential civil legal services to those of low- and moderate-\nincome.   \n  \n    Additionally, increasing funding for statewide civil legal services by one million dollars is of \nparamount importance in order to address the greater number of organizations seeking funds for \ncivil legal services.  While I am is thankful for the support that has been granted in the past, the \nimpact of these funds is being lessened by the challenges being faced by a greater number \nof  providers.    \n  \n    Finally, I appreciate the Judiciary’s willingness to serve as a conduit for statewide civil legal \nservices funding.  I  respectfully request that the Judiciary’s own budget priorities not be \nadversely impacted by an increase in legal services funding. \n  \n    Thank you for the opportunity to present this written testimony.  I do not plan to testify during \nthe hearing on this Bill. \n \n"

Effective 4/23/2057. (SD1) \n \nJudiciary's Position:  \nOn behalf of the Third Circuit, I am writing to respectfully request your support for House \nBill 400, H.D.1, S.D.1,  also known as the Judiciary Appropriations Act of 2025. This bill would \nappropriate funds for two critical budget requests for the Third Circuit: design funds for a new \nSouth Kohala district court facility and funding for a second district court judge in Kona. \nThe Capital Improvement Project Request (“CIP”) for plans and a design for a new South \nKohala District Courthouse is included in this bill in accordance with House Concurrent \nResolution No. 88, Regular Session of 2023, which requested that the Judiciary prepare a master \ndevelopment plan and submit a CIP for an upgraded South Kohala District Court. This CIP will \naddress critical deficiencies in the existing courthouse, meet the current and future needs of the \nNorth Hawaiʻi community, and ensure that the Judiciary is able to carry out its mission to deliver \njustice in an efficient and accessible manner. \n\nHouse Bill No. 400, H.D. 1, S.D.1, Relating to the Judiciary \nSenate Committee on Ways and Means \n \nMonday, March 31, 2025 \n \nPage 2  \n \n \n \nThe current South Kohala District Court building was constructed in 1982. According to \n2020 census data, the population of the North and South Kohala Districts served by the existing \nfacility has increased by 230% since 1980. This population growth has driven a significant rise in \ncase volume, with the court now handling between 9,000 and 10,000 cases annually. Despite this \nheavy caseload, the current courthouse is only 3,000 square feet, with one courtroom, minimal \noffice space, and no meeting rooms or waiting areas. Its size and design are severely inadequate, \nand often up to 50 individuals are forced to wait for their court hearings in their vehicles or outside \nin uncovered areas, exposed to the elements. The facility is also not ADA compliant, leading to \nhardships for disabled individuals—particularly with respect to restroom access.    \nSecurity is a paramount concern. The existing facility lacks separate entrances for judges \nand court staff, as well as secure, separate waiting areas for opposing parties in sensitive cases, \nsuch as temporary restraining orders (“TROs”). This creates the potential for dangerous \ninteractions. Because there are no holdings areas in the courthouse, in-custody defendants must \nremain in the jail van until their case is called, forcing defense attorneys to meet their clients in the \nvan. \nThe new South Kohala District Court facility will comprehensively address the many \ndeficiencies of the existing courthouse. It will be constructed on the Waimea Civic Center \ngrounds—the same state-owned parcel where the current facility is located—which will eliminate \nadditional land acquisition costs. It will feature expanded office space, secure holding areas, \nseparate waiting areas for opposing parties, and ADA-compliant restrooms. Client services, which \nare currently located off-site, will be integrated into the facility, and modern infrastructure and \nenergy-efficient systems will ensure sustainable operations. Importantly, the existing courthouse \nwill remain operational throughout construction, ensuring uninterrupted services.  \n \nIn addition to this CIP request, the appropriations for the Third Circuit’s operating budget \nin this bill includes funding for a second district court judge in Kona, as well as support staff. This \nfunding request arises from a critical and urgent need to address the severe strain on the Kona \nDistrict Court, where a single judge currently bears the immense responsibility of handling nearly \n16,000 individual cases annually. This unsustainable situation jeopardizes the Judiciary’s ability \nto fulfill its core mission to administer justice in an impartial, efficient, and accessible manner. \nThe population of the districts served by this court has nearly tripled since the first Kona \nDistrict Court Judge was sworn in nearly 40 years ago. Judicial resources have not kept pace with \nthis explosive growth, and despite the increase in population, the Kona District Court continues to \nrely on a single judge. This has created untenable caseloads that overwhelm court operations and \nhinder the court’s ability to effectively serve the public.  \nFor example, traffic court calendars routinely exceed 70 individual defendants in a single \nmorning, and litigants are frequently obliged to wait hours—sometimes over lunch and into the \nafternoon—for their cases to be heard. Court sessions often run from 8:30 a.m. until the close of \nbusiness without a substantial break for the judge or court staff. District Court staff often must \n\nHouse Bill No. 400, H.D. 1, S.D.1, Relating to the Judiciary \nSenate Committee on Ways and Means \n \nMonday, March 31, 2025 \n \nPage 3  \n \n \n \nalternate lunch breaks to keep hearings running uninterrupted, and attorneys, public defenders, \nprosecutors, and litigants are also subjected to these grueling schedules, which take a toll on their \nhealth, morale, and efficiency. Resulting delays in hearings and case resolutions have undermined \ntrust in the judicial system and can create significant personal and financial hardships for victims, \nwitnesses, and litigants. This relentless pace also compromises the judge’s ability to address other \ncritical judicial duties, such as reviewing search warrants, making judicial determinations of \nprobable cause, and, most concerningly, processing applications for TROs.  \nThe cascade of inefficiencies that follows from a lack of sufficient judicial resources \nundermines the quality of justice delivered by the Kona District Court. One judge, no matter how \ndedicated, cannot sustainably balance the competing demands of timeliness and thoroughness \nunder the current circumstances. The immense pressure on staff, attorneys, and litigants is \ndemoralizing, leads to burnout, and diminishes the public’s confidence in the Judiciary. \nThe addition of a second District Court Judge in Kona is the only viable solution to this \nurgent crisis. The Judiciary has sponsored pending legislation that would establish one additional \ndistrict court judge position in the Third Circuit (H.B. 401, H.D.1, S.D.1 and S.B. 267) \nconcurrently with this appropriations bill. Moreover, as there is currently a vacant District Court \ncourtroom at the Keahuolū Courthouse, the addition of a second District Court Judge will not \nrequire any additional capital improvement costs. A second judge would not only reduce individual \ncaseloads, but also allow the court to operate more efficiently, dispose of cases more promptly, \nand provide litigants and victims with the timely and equitable justice they deserve.  \nI respectfully ask for your consideration and support in approving the Judiciary \nAppropriations Act of 2025 that includes these critical appropriations for the Third Circuit. Thank \nyou for your commitment to strengthening our judicial system and addressing the pressing needs \nof the Third Circuit and our Hawaiʻi Island community, and thank you for the opportunity to offer \ntestimony on this important bill. \n \n\n \n \nSouth Kohala District Court Photos \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nLeft: Depicts the only waiting area for the public, which is located outside.

The Judiciary remains vigilant during this period of uncertainty \nover federal funding and the possible impact on the State and Judiciary budgets and operations. \nWe have assessed federally-funded grant projects of the Judiciary and are committed to ongoing \ncommunication with the Legislature and with local non-governmental partners of the Judiciary \nwho rely on federal funding. \n\nHouse Bill No. 400, House Draft 1, Senate Draft 1, Relating to the Judiciary \n \nSenate Committee on Ways and Means \n \nMonday, March 31, 2025 \n \nPage 2  \n \n \nThe Judiciary also requests a total of $11.9M in bond funds for capital improvement \nprojects in FY 2026. This amount in bond funds, reflected in the current House Draft 1, Senate \nDraft 1, includes a request for $2M more in lump sum than the measure as introduced. This is \nbecause the Judiciary received new information that the relocation of the Children’s Justice Center \non O‘ahu will require at least $2M more than previously appropriated. These circumstances are \ndetailed further below, and the Judiciary appreciates the Senate Committee on Judiciary for \nconsidering this and including it in the current version. \nThe Judiciary supports the Senate Committee on Judiciary’s addition of funds in JUD601 \nfor civil legal services and immigration-related proceedings while respectfully requesting that any \nappropriations in these areas not supplant the Judiciary’s existing funding nor current budget \nrequests. \nOperating Requests: \nOperating resource requests center around funding to make permanent or expand three \nSpecialty Courts on O‘ahu, to fully staff the new Wahiawā District Court that will open during this \nbiennium, an additional District Court Judge and support staff in Kona, cybersecurity and critical \ntechnology costs, funding for the Criminal Justice Research Institute (CJRI), and restoration of \nfunding for essential staffing that was defunded during the early part of the COVID-19 pandemic. \nAs for positions, nine of the 18 (17.0 permanent and 1.0 temporary) are requested to \ncontinue current staffing. This is because seven temporary positions for the Women’s Court Pilot \nProject, along with one permanent position and one temporary position for the CJRI, will expire, \nbut there are compelling reasons to continue these programs and the necessary staffing. The \nremaining requested positions will significantly expand capacity to certain operations. \nBrief details of each request are provided below: \nWomen’s Court – The Women’s Court Pilot Project was established by the Legislature in \nJuly of 2022 (Act 243/22) with funding for a three-year pilot that included seven temporary \npositions, which are set to expire at the end of FY 2025. The request of $705,416 in FY 2026 and \n$705,416 in FY 2027, and 8.0 FTE permanent positions will establish a permanent Women’s \nCourt. The Women’s Court, also known as Mohala Wahine, was created to address the rapid \ngrowth in the incarceration of women in the United States by providing comprehensive court-\nsupervised treatment, opportunities, and resources as an alternative to incarceration for women in \nthe criminal justice system who have suffered trauma, abuse, poverty, mental illness, substance \nuse disorders, and/or unhealthy relationships. The goal of the program is for the participants to \nidentify and address issues, to prevent re-entry into criminality, and to aid the participants in \nbettering their economic conditions and life circumstances. Given the need for the program, a \nstrong start as a three-year pilot created by the Legislature, and that the program (and positions \nand funding) will expire at the end of FY 2025, the Judiciary requests funding and eight positions \n(a net increase of one), including one substance use counselor. \n\nHouse Bill No. 400, House Draft 1, Senate Draft 1, Relating to the Judiciary \n \nSenate Committee on Ways and Means \n \nMonday, March 31, 2025 \n \nPage 3  \n \n \nTruancy Court and Early Education Intervention Program (EEIP) – The Judiciary requests \nfunding of $188,388 in FY 2026 and $183,288 in FY 2027 to restore funding for three redescribed \nSocial Worker positions and additional expenses to significantly expand the Truancy Court and \nEEIP on O‘ahu. Truancy Court and EEIP are designed to identify and address, where possible, the \ndifficulties underlying chronic school truancy. The focus of Truancy Court is diversion from the \nformal court process. The bulk of the preventative work is done on the front-end to stop truancy \npetitions from being filed in court by addressing barriers to school attendance. To accomplish this, \nPersons in Need of Supervision (PINS) Social Workers visit campuses weekly to meet with \nstudents identified as having attendance issues. \nDriving While Impaired (DWI) Court Program – The Judiciary requests funding of \n$232,412 in FY 2026 and $237,612 in FY 2027 for two positions that will be redescribed to be a \nSocial Worker IV and Specialty Court Coordinator, and additional expenses, to make the DWI \nCourt Program permanent. The DWI Court Program was established in April 2012 and has been \noperational since January 2013, with initial federal funding for the program from the National \nHighway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) through a grant administered by the State \nDepartment of Transportation. The DWI Court Program confronts the persistent problem of \nimpaired driving and seeks to reduce recidivism among repeat and high-risk offenders by \naddressing the underlying cause of impaired driving, which is alcohol and/or substance use \ndisorder. Without intervention, this population of chronically impaired drivers might continue to \nreoffend and endanger public safety on our roadways. Securing permanent funding would allow \nthe DWI Court Program to continue, grow, and provide accountability and monitoring of the \ntreatment and recovery process for repeat and high-risk offenders. \nWahiawā District Court – There are five requests related to the Wahiawā District Court, \nwhich will open to the public in Spring 2026. The first relates to restoring funding for three \npositions in the amount of $192,408 in FY 2026 and $192,408 in FY 2027 to transition to a full \ncomplement of adult client services to the new Wahiawā District Court to support case \nmanagement of probation cases. The planned Adult Client Services Branch (ACSB) Wahiawā \nDistrict Court Unit will play a critical role in bringing court services to the community. When the \nACSB Wahiawā District Court Unit is operational, it will service an estimated 200 to 300 cases \nbased on the current clients that reside in the designated geographic areas: Waimea, Mililani, \nKunia, Whitmore Village, Waialua, Hale‘iwa, and Sunset. \nThe second request for Wahiawā District Court is for funding of $27,084 in FY 2026 (six \nmonths’ salary only) and $54,168 in FY 2027, and 1.0 FTE permanent position for a Janitor II. \nThe existing Wahiawā District Courthouse is in a rental space and janitorial services are covered \nby the lease. This position is necessary to support cleaning levels for the types of uses in the new \nfacility. For instance, the existing facility does not include a probation unit which performs drug \ntesting and will require additional cleaning.  This position is requested to provide the level of \ncleaning required to provide a clean and healthy environment for all who enter and use the facility. \nThe third request for Wahiawā District Court is funding of $346,209 in FY 2026 and \n$486,967 in FY 2027 to provide contracted security personnel for patrol, primarily interior. The \n\nHouse Bill No. 400, House Draft 1, Senate Draft 1, Relating to the Judiciary \n \nSenate Committee on Ways and Means \n \nMonday, March 31, 2025 \n \nPage 4  \n \n \nnew courthouse will have two courtrooms and expand its services to include Ho‘okele (court \ninformation services), civil case processing, and probation services. Courthouse security for the \ncurrent location consists of two unarmed contracted private security personnel and one Deputy \nSheriff under the District Court Sheriff Command. To meet best practices, the new Wahiawā \nDistrict Court would need one sergeant and three Deputy Sheriffs assigned to patrol the new \nWahiawā District Court. Contracted security services could provide an alternative, albeit less than \noptimal. Funding this request would support this critical safety function. \nThe fourth request for Wahiawā District Court is to restore funding of $52,908 in FY 2026 \nand $52,908 in FY 2027 for a position redescribed to an IT Tech III and dedicated to this facility. \nThis IT Tech will provide support for courtroom video recording and video conferencing systems \nthat enable litigants to participate in court hearings remotely. The new Wahiawā District Court \nwill feature an additional courtroom, as well as an increased number of employees permanently \nbased there.  Since the pandemic, the First Circuit has permitted most District Court litigants to \nopt for remote hearing appearances by Zoom. At some hearings, dozens of litigants do so. A \nfunctioning courtroom AV system is therefore critical to the core operations of the court. \nThe fifth request for Wahiawā District Court is to restore funding of $317,448 in FY 2026 \nand $317,448 in FY 2027 for four District Court Clerk II and two Bailiff II positions. These \npositions, based in Wahiawā, will also support ‘Ewa and Wai‘anae District Courts, thereby \nenhancing the services available at these three rural courts. These positions provide courtroom \nclerical coverage for District Court criminal, civil, and traffic proceedings, and associated court \nclerical duties to record and facilitate cases throughout the court system. Upon opening and staffing \nof the Wahiawā District Court, civil filings, Ho‘okele, and court hearings for these areas would be \ntransferred there, from downtown Honolulu. A dedicated and permanent staff of District Court \nClerks in Wahiawā would facilitate and streamline coverage for the ‘Ewa, Wai‘anae, and Wahiawā \nDistrict Court civil calendars—Wahiawā would be the hub. Restoring the funding for these \npositions will allow the West and Central O‘ahu court users to expeditiously access and attend \nDistrict Court business and enable the District Courts to facilitate and adjudicate cases in a more \nefficient manner. \nKona District Court Judge – The Judiciary requests $368,943 in FY 2026 and $360,048 in \nFY 2027, and 4.0 FTE permanent positions, for an additional District Court Judge and three \nnecessary support staff. The additional judgeship is needed to address the current extraordinary \ncaseload in Kona, as well as the continuing increases in complexity of cases and the time required \nto schedule and hear cases on the court calendars, and to improve public service and safety. The \nKona District Court is assigned to hear all District Court criminal, traffic, and civil matters for the \ndivisions of North Kona, South Kona, and Ka‘ū. The first Kona District Court Judge was sworn in \nnearly forty years ago. Since then, the combined population of North and South Kona and Ka‘ū \nhas more than doubled. The current caseload of the Kona District Court is nearly 16,000 cases \nannually, which are all currently being handled by one judge in one courtroom. This combination \nof factors has led to unsustainable court congestion and delays. \n\nHouse Bill No. 400, House Draft 1, Senate Draft 1, Relating to the Judiciary \n \nSenate Committee on Ways and Means \n \nMonday, March 31, 2025 \n \nPage 5  \n \n \nCybersecurity and Technology – The Judiciary has three requests pertaining to \ncybersecurity and other technology.  \nFirst, is a request for $1,175,300 in FY 2026 and $1,175,300 in FY 2027 to upgrade email \nsubscriptions to improve security capabilities. The Judiciary currently uses Microsoft O365 for \nbasic email with multifactor authentication and basic threat detection and protection. With \ngovernment agencies and courts increasingly being targeted for cybersecurity attacks, this level of \nsecurity is no longer sufficient. Upgrading from O365 basic email to M365 G5 email would \nsignificantly enhance the Judiciary’s cybersecurity posture. M365 G5 email—the same level of \nthe State of Hawai‘i Executive Branch, which the Legislature funded during the 2024 Regular \nSession—includes robust cybersecurity features that address prevention, detection, investigation, \nand remediation of cybersecurity attacks on emails and Sharepoint data. \nThe second cybersecurity-related request is for $458,224 in FYs 2026 and 2027 to restore \nfunding for four positions that have since been redescribed to a modern need—a dedicated \ncybersecurity staff. In addition, this funding would allow for additional tools required to manage \nthe Judiciary’s inventory of assets in an efficient and secure way. Specifically, this includes a suite \nthat can create strong access control, maintain a current inventory and patch the assets, and \nmaintain configuration baselines. \nThe third technology-focused request is for $560,000 in FY 2026 and $420,000 in FY 2027 \nto replace network switches in courthouses across the state that have reached their end-of-life. \nNetwork switches provide internet and phone connections to PCs, Cisco phones, printers, and \ncourtroom devices. They were last replaced between 2016 and 2018; the average useful lifespan \nis between five to eight years. As network switches age, network connections become unreliable \nand eventually become inoperable. A significant number of Judiciary courthouse network switches \nhave reached the end of their useful lifespan. \nCriminal Justice Research Institute (CJRI) – There are two requests related to the Criminal \nJustice Research Institute, established by Act 179 (SLH 2019). Both are to continue the resources \nappropriated in Act 147 (SLH 2023). More specifically, the first is $512,624 in FY 2026 and \n$577,058 in FY 2027, for a 1.0 FTE permanent Project Specialist position and software. Act 147 \n(SLH 2023) appropriated funds for a permanent Project Specialist and software/technology costs \nfor two years to begin to establish a centralized statewide criminal pretrial justice data reporting \nand collection system. Since then, CJRI has developed the foundation, including continuing to \ncreate a data warehouse and software tool that will modernize data sharing and create a centralized \nsource of pretrial data. CJRI has obtained 15 years of pretrial data from the Department of Law \nEnforcement, the Department of Attorney General, and the Judiciary, and has partnered with these \nagencies to begin mapping data to draft data pipelines. Staff have been trained with software to \ningest data into the data warehouse and established preliminary datasets for pretrial research. The \nProject Specialist position was created to support CJRI with in-house IT expertise. Although the \nposition is permanent, funding ends on June 30, 2025. To build upon this firm foundation, continue \nwork to establish a centralized statewide criminal pretrial justice data reporting and collection \n\nHouse Bill No. 400, House Draft 1, Senate Draft 1, Relating to the Judiciary \n \nSenate Committee on Ways and Means \n \nMonday, March 31, 2025 \n \nPage 6  \n \n \nsystem, as well as continue to assess data and be available to inform policymakers, CJRI requires \nthat resources continue. \nThe second CJRI-related request is to continue 1.0 FTE temporary Project Specialist and \n$71,016 in both years of the biennium. In addition to the permanent position with two-year funding \ndescribed above, Act 147 (SLH 2023) authorized a temporary full-time Project Specialist position, \nalso with two-year funding ending on June 30, 2025. This position ensures that the Judiciary can \nfully support CJRI’s technical needs with a position in the Judiciary’s IT department focused on \nthe CJRI. As Judiciary data is ingested into the data warehouse, CJRI researchers need support \nfrom the Judiciary technical staff to ensure that the data is transformed into criminal pretrial data \nfor meaningful use for research. \nOffice of the Public Guardian (OPG) – The Judiciary requests $136,314 in FY 2026 and \n$125,424 in FY 2027, and 3.0 FTE permanent positions, for three Social Services Assistant IV \npositions and related equipment for the Office of the Public Guardian. The positions will assist the \nThird Circuit (Hawai‘i County) and First Circuit (City and County of Honolulu) guardians. OPG \npersonnel are court-appointed to make informed decisions in the best interests of incapacitated \nindividuals by safeguarding their rights, dignity, humanity, and quality of life. When OPG is \nappointed as guardian, it comes with a myriad of challenges associated with researching and \nuntangling the ward’s unique situation. This work requires the guardians to work within many \nsystems and gain familiarity with each ward. The additional positions will be assigned medium \nand low priority tasks that are necessary but are often deferred because of urgent or emergent \ncircumstances for less stable wards. In addition, Social Services Assistants could improve safety \nwhen accompanying guardians in certain situations. Staff sometimes enter homes where other \nresidents who are not under OPG’s care are unstable. Guardians have experienced threats of \nviolence, dog bites, and other safety concerns. The Social Services Assistants would enable \nguardians to increase visits and care to all OPG wards. \nRisk Management Cost – The Judiciary requests $151,000 in FY 2026 and $151,000 in \nFY 2027 to cover an increase in the risk management costs owed to the Department of Accounting \nand General Services (DAGS). Pursuant to Comptroller Memoranda 1999-28 and 2007-05, and \nHRS § 41-D(4), DAGS bills the Judiciary annually for its share of the state’s risk management \ncosts which include insurance policy premiums. DAGS notified the Judiciary that its share of the \nrisk management costs would increase by approximately $151,000. \nTargeted Funding Restoration – The Judiciary’s next group of requests is to restore funding \nfor selected defunded positions. During the early part of the pandemic, over $11 million was \nremoved from the Judiciary’s budget for 192 vacant positions, to help the State’s economic crisis \nat that time. The Judiciary has continued to refine staffing statewide, including redescribing \npositions to modern needs and employing additional recruitment methods, particularly for \npositions where there have been recruiting difficulties. Nevertheless, these requests to restore \nfunding are for positions critical to operations now and going forward. Specifically: \n(1) \nCourts of Appeal \n\nHouse Bill No. 400, House Draft 1, Senate Draft 1, Relating to the Judiciary \n \nSenate Committee on Ways and Means \n \nMonday, March 31, 2025 \n \nPage 7  \n \n \nRestored funding of $72,372 for FY 2026 and $72,372 in FY 2027 for a Judicial Assistant \nII at the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) would ensure necessary support to each judge of this \nCourt. There are positions for six Associate Judges in the ICA and one Chief Judge. Each judge \nhas a single Judicial Assistant II, and each position is imperative to the operations of the ICA. ICA \nJudicial Assistants use the Judiciary Information Management System (JIMS) and ICA internal \ndatabase, assist with hiring and personnel matters, assist in compiling reports and statistics, assist \nin training of Law Clerks and Staff Attorneys, provide coverage as needed for other Judicial \nAssistants and Appellate Clerks, assist with screening of cases for conflicts of interest, and \nundertake numerous housekeeping and institutional tasks that maintain the high standard and spirit \nof aloha that is the hallmark of the ICA. \n(2) \nFirst Circuit  \nRestored funding of $47,004 in FY 2026 and $47,004 in FY 2027 for one position \nredescribed to a Judicial Clerk III. The shift in court operations to many virtual hearings has \nbenefitted court-users, but has strained staffing. This position, updated to a modern need, would \nhost remote hearings, process calendars for various case types, obtain and review efiled documents \nin traffic and criminal cases, and more. Existing staff have covered these responsibilities, \nsometimes leading to delays or backlogs in other sections. This is unsustainable. \nRestored funding of $105,816 in FY 2026 and $105,816 in FY 2027 for two hybrid District \nCourt Clerks IIs and Bailiffs. Two District Court Clerk positions will be redescribed to hybrid \nClerks and Bailiffs to increase flexibility to address court needs. Specifically, these hybrid \npositions would increase the Honolulu District Court’s capacity to meet needs in courtrooms, \nincluding processing witness certification fees and implementing in-court processing, which \nwould reduce delays in updating and processing the court record and delays in litigants’ ability to \nobtain case-related court dates. \n(3) \nSecond Circuit \nThe Judiciary requests restoration of a subtotal of $151,032 for both years of the biennium \nfor a District Court Clerk in Lahaina, a District Court Clerk in Wailuku, and an Account Clerk. \nThe District Court Clerk in Lahaina is responsible for the official court records in \narraignment and trial proceedings. This position issues disposition slips to the public as they \nconclude their proceedings, ensures documents are submitted and conformed to statutory and \nprocedural requirements, prepares warrants and orders pertaining to bail that may result in money \nbeing returned, and assists the public over the counter and over the telephone. This position is \nessential to rural courtroom services. \nThe Wailuku District Court Clerk position is necessary to normalize staffing levels and \nimprove service to the public. In this largest court facility in the county, inadequate staffing leads \nto delays and the inability to cover—as is often needed—rural courts that struggle with staffing. \n\nHouse Bill No. 400, House Draft 1, Senate Draft 1, Relating to the Judiciary \n \nSenate Committee on Ways and Means \n \nMonday, March 31, 2025 \n \nPage 8  \n \n \nThe Account Clerk IV position provides critical support services to the Fiscal Office and \nthe public. This includes creating purchase orders and processing invoices. While each position is \nresponsible for a particular appropriation, the amount assigned to this defunded position has \nincreased by over 25% since FY 2021. Since this position was defunded, the Second Circuit’s \nFiscal Office assumed the responsibilities, thereby diverting focus from the Fiscal Office’s primary \nduties. \n(4) \nThird Circuit \nA key request in the Third Circuit is to restore $73,836 in FY 2026 and $73,836 in FY 2027 \nfor a Social Worker IV in the Kona Juvenile Client Services Branch. While this position was \ndefunded early in the pandemic, Third Circuit decided to fill the position in March 2022 because \nthe remaining two staff were overwhelmed by attempting to address all informal status offenses, \nlaw violators, and school nonattendance referrals. The Third Circuit used resources from funded \nvacancies, fewer jury trials, and other areas to fund and fill this position at that time. Due to \nincreasing budget constraints, this is not sustainable without detrimental effects on other court \noperations. \nNext is a request to restore $57,192 in FY 2026 and $57,192 in FY 2027 for a Court \nDocuments Clerk III in the Hilo Legal Documents Branch. This position, among other duties, \nassists with Circuit and Family Court filings. This includes addressing time-sensitive filings, such \nas Temporary Restraining Orders (TROs), and assisting self-represented litigants (SRLs) at the \ncounter and over the phone. There has been a steady and significant increase in TROs filed in Hilo. \nIndeed, from 2019 to 2022, TRO filings in Hilo, particularly related to domestic abuse cases, have \nmore than doubled the amount in Kona. \nThe next request is to restore $47,004 in FY 2026 and $47,004 in FY 2027 for a Judicial \nClerk III position in the Kona Traffic Violations Branch. This section supports one District Court \nJudge that hears cases from the North and South Kona and Ka‘ū Districts. The vacancy of this \nposition has caused a backlog in creating citations in the Judiciary Information Management \nSystem (JIMS) and processing default judgments. Although some automation has made many \ntasks easier, automation in this unit has not offset added demands. The complexity of the legal \nprocess requires staff to articulate the information to self-represented litigants (SRLs) and process \nthe work accurately and efficiently. \nFinally, the Third Circuit requests to restore $52,908 in FY 2026 and $52,908 in FY 2027 \nfor an IT Support Technician III in Hilo. Third Circuit’s limited IT support must cover a large land \narea and three facilities. Indeed, these responsibilities are so important that the Third Circuit \nredescribed a defunded position into this IT Support Technician III and filled the position, using \ninternal funding from other areas available due to the COVID-19 pandemic leading to temporary \nshifts in operations. This is unsustainable without detrimental impacts to other operations. \n \n\nHouse Bill No. 400, House Draft 1, Senate Draft 1, Relating to the Judiciary \n \nSenate Committee on Ways and Means \n \nMonday, March 31, 2025 \n \nPage 9  \n \n \n(5) \nAdministration \nRestored funding of $71,016 in FY 2026 and $71,016 in FY 2027 for a Purchasing and \nSpecifications Specialist in the Judiciary’s Financial Services Department. This position is in a \ndivision that is responsible for a high volume of purchasing, procurement, and contracts. Among \nother things, this division annually processes over 1,000 purchase requisitions, nearly 900 \ncontracts, and approximately 12 Competitive Sealed Bids and 17 Competitive Purchase of Service \nand Competitive Sealed Proposals solicitations. \nCapital Improvement Requests: \nCapital Improvement Project (CIP) requirements continue to remain a major item of \nconcern as the Judiciary’s infrastructure continues to age and deteriorate, and as the population \nserved and services provided by the Judiciary continue to expand. We request CIP bond funds \ntotaling $11.9 million for FY 2026 to address critical needs, some of which relate to the health and \nsafety of Judiciary employees and the public.  \nSpecifically, the Judiciary is requesting $4.0 million to design a new South Kohala District \nCourthouse. The current South Kohala District Court carries significant concerns for safety, space, \ntemperature, noise, and is quite simply inadequate to serve the community’s court-related needs. \nThe Judiciary also requests $900,000 to replace an A/C chiller on Kaua‘i, at Pu‘uhonua Kaulike. \nThe chiller is near the end of its lifecycle, and A/C manufacturing is experiencing hardships \nresulting in long lead times.  \nThe Judiciary also requests $7.0 million in lump sum bond funds to address both continuing \nand emerging building issues statewide. As stated above, this includes $2.0 million that will be \ndirected to a shortfall in funding for relocation of the Children’s Justice Center on Oʻahu. The \nLegislature provided $6.0 million for that project in 2023. Since then, we have located a site and, \nalong with DAGS, are proceeding. While the final amount remains uncertain, the latest estimate \nis that the project cost will exceed $8.0 million. Accordingly, we make this request for additional \nlump sum funds to maintain flexibility. \nThe Judiciary respectfully requests your support of House Bill No. 400, House Draft 1, \nSenate Draft 1, the Judiciary’s biennium budget request with an effective date of July 1, 2025. \nThank you for the opportunity to testify on this measure. \n\n \nMakiki: 1020 South Beretania St., Honolulu, Hawai‘i  96814     Downtown: 1188 Bishop St., Ste 3209, Honolulu, HI 96813 \nwww.tlchawaii.org    (808) 777-7071    fax (808) 930-0969 \n \nStatement Before The Committee on Ways and Means \nMonday, March 31, 2025 \n10:01 AM \nConference Room 211 & Videoconference \n \nin SUPPORT of \nHB400, HD1, SD1  - RELATING TO THE JUDICIARY \n \nChair DELA CRUZ, Vice Chair MORIWAKI, and Members of the House Judiciary Committees \n \nThe Legal Clinic (TLC) supports HB400, which appropriates funds for the Judiciary for the fiscal biennium \nbeginning 7/1/2025, and ending 6/30/2027. \n \nTLC is a Hawai‘i nonprofit, nonpartisan organization. TLC is a direct legal services provider, representing \nthose in Hawai‘i who meet income eligibility guidelines without regard to immigration status, national \norigin, ethnic background, race, religion, ideology, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, or disability. \nTLC works alongside immigrants so they can attain authorization to work and live with dignity, reunite \nwith their families after years of separation and escape horrific violence to find refuge in the United States. \nTLC recognizes that every person needs and deserves to feel a sense of trust, welcome, and belonging. \n \nTLC is a current grantee under the Judiciary’s civil legal services fund. The Judiciary’s civil legal services \nfund is critical to supporting safety net providers in Hawaii. TLC supports the current budget of $1.2 million \nand an increase of an additional $1 million to support the work of safety net providers in the local \ncommunity. The needs of local safety net providers are continually growing. For example, with the current \nfederal administration’s immigration enforcement actions and rhetoric, TLC anticipates an exponential \nincrease in those needing support in immigration proceedings.   \n \nThus, TLC supports the current budget of $1.2 million and an increase of an additional $1 million to the \nthe Judiciary’s civil legal services fund. Thank you for the opportunity to testify in support of HB400. TLC \nrespectfully urges the Committee members to pass HB400 out of your Committee.

LASH supports the Judiciary’s overall budget priorities, as well as its continued \nadministration of funding for statewide civil legal services. \nHB400 contains a line-item for statewide civil legal services, which the Judiciary graciously \nadministers to the State’s qualifying legal services providers to provide “general civil legal services \nwithout charge to indigent residents of the State of Hawaiʻi.” We are asking to supplement this \nline-item with an additional $1 million to ensure that legal service providers have increased \nresources to meet the needs of the communities we serve.  This ask is intended to supplement \nthe Judiciary’s legislative priorities, and should not come at the expense of any priority or \nportion of their proposed budget. \nIMPACT OF HB400 \nWith the support of this line-item, Legal Aid has been able to provide civil legal services to our \nlow-income and vulnerable populations across our state. As the state’s largest and oldest legal \nservice provider, we deliver legal services in the areas most needed by Hawaiʻi’s residents, \nincluding family law, housing, domestic abuse, consumer protection, immigration law, public \nbenefits, child welfare, and elder law. Legal Aid provides these services statewide through its 12 \noffices located in every county and on every island, as well as through our Maui Disaster Legal \nServices office and our Hawaiʻi Immigrant Justice Center. Our over 100 dedicated staff are all \ncommitted to our mission of obtaining a fair and just Hawaiʻi for all. \nEach year, Legal Aid impacts the lives of approximately 20,000 Hawaiʻi residents. In the last fiscal \nyear, we received over 15,000 requests for assistance and were able to provide legal help in a little \nover 7000 cases in legal areas ranging from family, housing, consumer, foreclosure, public \nbenefits, elder law, homelessness, immigration, language access, and child welfare. Of those \nserved last year, over 2,000 of our clients were homeless or at risk for homelessness, over 1,600 \nare Native Hawaiian, over 1,200 experienced domestic violence and about 700 spoke a primary \nlanguage other than English.  \n \n \n\n \n \nNEED FOR INCREASED FUNDING \nWe are grateful to the legislature for their past and continuing support of general civil legal services \nin the Judiciary budget, and to the Judiciary for providing a home for this program and \nadministering these important funds. However, more funding is urgently needed. \nIn Legal Services Corporation’s Justice Gap Report (2022), researchers found that “low-income \n[individuals] did not receive any or enough legal help for 92% of their civil legal problems[,]” \nand that Hawaiʻi is unfortunately consistent with this national average. More than one-half of \npeople nationwide have no confidence that they would be able to find a lawyer they could afford \nif they needed one. In Hawaiʻi, at least 72% of households had one or more civil legal problems \nin the past year. Current resources are not meeting our community’s needs: the National Justice \nIndex determined that nine times as many legal services attorneys and advocates are needed to \nmeet Hawaiʻi low-income residents’ legal needs. \n \nThere are now four legal service providers receiving this critical funding, and all of our low-\nincome and vulnerable populations statewide and across demographics are positively impacted \nby this support. We respectfully request that you increase support for legal services by adding an \nadditional $1,000,000 to the line item for legal services, which is an important part of the safety \nnet of social services that Hawaiʻi’s residents need.  \n \nWe are sensitive to the fact that the State is facing significant fiscal pressures due to potential \nfederal funding cuts. In addition, changes to the federal funding and policy landscape also \nrequire additional support for Hawaiʻi’s legal services providers. Recently, there have been \ndramatic reductions in available federal funds for victims of crime and domestic-violence \nsurvivors. Legal Aid receives substantial federal funds to provide services related to housing, \nassisting Hawaiʻi’s houseless communities, kūpuna legal services, health insurance navigators, \nand more, and is a clear preview of what’s to come. Disaster legal services, which includes over \none million in funding for Hawaiʻi, was also recently left out of the most recent funding \nresolution. And, we may see attempts to drastically reduce funding for legal services overall. \n \nThe Judiciary has been a leader in supporting “access to justice” initiatives here in Hawaiʻi, and \nhas generously provided a home for this line-item. Our ask is intended to supplement the \nJudiciary’s legislative priorities, and should not come at the expense of any priority or portion \nof the proposed budget. \n \nThank you for this opportunity to provide testimony. \n \nSincerely, \nDavid Kaulia Kopper  \nExecutive Director, Legal Aid Society of Hawaiʻi \n \n \n \n \n\n1100 Alakea Street, Suite 1000 • Honolulu, HI 96813 • Phone: (808) 537-1868 • Fax: (808) 521-7936 • http://HSBA.org \n \n \nOFFICERS \nMark M.

Dela Cruz, Chair \nSenator Sharon Y. Moriwaki, Vice Chair \n \nFROM:  \nMark M. Murakami, HSBA President \n \nRE:  \n \nHB 400, SD1 - RELATING TO THE JUDICIARY \n \nChair Dela Cruz, Vice Moriwaki and members of the Committee \nThe Hawaii State Bar Association (HSBA) appreciates the opportunity to offer \ntestimony in STRONG SUPPORT of HB 400, SD1 – RELATING TO THE \nJUDICIARY.  The State Judiciary plays a vital governmental role in upholding a \nfair and civil society, yet it constitutes only about 2% of the overall State budget. \nCommunity reports indicate a growing demand for judicial services in the current \nbiennium.  It is our firm belief that the Judiciary has demonstrated and continues \nto exhibit fiscal responsibility. Considering these challenges, supporting the \nJudiciary's proposed biennium budget becomes imperative to ensure its ability to \nmeet the growing demands efficiently. \nThe Judiciary is tasked with some of the most important of all State \nresponsibilities. Individuals utilize court services during some of the most stressful \ntimes of their lives. Families rely on the Judiciary to settle disputes which tear at \nthe fabric of their household. Business owners and entrepreneurs rely on the \nJudiciary to resolve contract or insurance issues which threaten their continued \nexistence.  Individuals who have been wronged, intentionally or unintentionally, by \nothers rely on the Judiciary to make them whole. Those accused of crimes rely on \nthe Judiciary to hear their “side of the story” and enforce speedy trial constitutional \nrights, and the government must have an opportunity to present its case on behalf \nof the public.   \nIt’s critical for the Legislature to provide sufficient support for the State Judiciary \nas provided in their budget request. Thank you for the opportunity to submit these \ncomments in STRONG SUPPORT of HB 400, SD1. \nMahalo for this opportunity to provide testimony in support. \n \n\n \n \n70170 \n  \nNickolas Kacprowski \nBoard President  \nRachel Figueroa \nExecutive Director  \n  \n545 Queen Street, Suite 100 \nHonolulu, Hawai`i 96813  \nPhone: (808) 528-7050  \nFax: (808) 524-2147  \n www.vlsh.org  \n \nTESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF H.B. 400, HD1, SD1 \nRELATING TO THE JUDICIARY \nCommittee on Ways and Means  – March 31, 2025  10:01 a.m. \n  \nCHAIR DELA CRUZ, VICE CHAIR MORIWAKI AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE \nON WAYS AND MEANS:   \n  \nVolunteer Legal Services Hawai‘i supports the passage of H.B. 400, HD1, SD1. \n \nThis critical funding would go to funding civil legal services, including but not limited to the \ndelivery of civil legal services to low- and moderate- income individuals in Hawai‘i.  \n \nVolunteer Legal is pursuing a one million ($1,000,000) dollar increase in funding for the civil \nlegal services line item for providers. The civil legal services line item was initially intended for \nstatewide general civil legal service providers. Other important legal service providers are also \naccessing the line item, and we anticipate that more will apply. \n \nVolunteer Legal is concerned about all the federal actions limiting services to those residents \nwho need it the most.  We are more worried than ever about the impact that the limiting of services has \non the safety net of legal services. There are many unmet needs1, and Volunteer Legal is often the last \nline of defense for someone facing critical issues, like landlord/tenant or child custody issues.  \n \n In the last forty-four years, Volunteer Legal has partnered with volunteer attorneys in the \nprovision of civil legal assistance to individuals and families of Hawaii.  While Volunteer Legal \nServices Hawai‘i’s only office is on Oahu, we service residents of Hawai‘i statewide.  In 2024, with \nonly a staff of 9, Volunteer Legal qualified around 1000 individuals. Volunteer Legal provides legal \ncheckups, educational presentations, clinics, brief services and/or full representations.  Twenty-one \n(21%) of those helped are homeless or at the risk of being homeless, 28% of those helped suffer from \ndomestic violence, 6% of those helped were veterans, 26% of those helped are disabled, and 20% of \nthose helped were aged 60 and over.  If not for Volunteer Legal Services Hawai‘i, these individuals \nwould have otherwise gone without legal help.   \n \nOur request is not intended to supplant any of the Judiciary’s other priorities. Volunteer Legal \nServices Hawai‘i thanks the committee for the past support of legal services in the judiciary budget. \nWe respectfully request your passage of H.B. 400, HD1, SD1.  Thank you for this opportunity to \nprovide testimony.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSincerely,  \nRachel Figueroa, Executive Director \n \n \n \n1According to the ALICE (Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed) report in 2022, in Hawaii alone, 11% of \nresidents were below the Federal Poverty Line (FPL), with 33% that earned above the Federal Poverty Line but not enough \nto afford the basics in the community where they live.  https://unitedforalice.org/national-overview \n“Low-income Americans do not get any or enough legal help for 92% of their substantial civil legal problems.” \nhttps://justicegap.lsc.gov/resource/executive-summary/ \n\nHB-400-SD-1 \nSubmitted on: 3/25/2025 8:56:02 PM \nTestimony for WAM on 3/31/2025 10:01:00 AM \nSubmitted By \nOrganization \nTestifier Position \nTestify \nCarolyn Weygan-\nHildebrand \nIndividual \nSupport \nWritten Testimony \nOnly \n \n \nComments:  \nThe legal system is complex, especially for immigrants and their families. Supporting funding \nfor legal services for individuals in immigration-related court proceedings is important. \nMahalo. \n \n"
