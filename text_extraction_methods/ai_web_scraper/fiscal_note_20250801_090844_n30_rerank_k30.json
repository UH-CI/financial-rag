  "overview": "HB727 establishes a three-year Women's Court Pilot Program in the Kona division of the Third Circuit,  making permanent the existing program in the First Circuit.  The measure appropriates $514,900 for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027 for the program, including funding for mental health services, substance abuse treatment, and staff positions (including a full-time equivalent Kona drug court probation supervisor).  The Judiciary is required to submit a report to the Legislature by 2028 regarding the program's status and potential expansion to other circuits.  The program sunsets on June 30, 2027.",
  "policy_impact": "HB727, HD1, establishes a three-year Women's Court Pilot Program in Kona, appropriating $514,900 for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027.  This modifies existing judicial processes by creating a specialized court focused on women,  potentially aligning with broader legislative strategies to address gender disparities within the justice system and improve outcomes for female offenders.  The program's success will be evaluated through reports submitted to the Governor and Legislature in 2026, 2027, and 2028, informing future policy decisions and potential expansion to other circuits.",
  "appropriations": "HB 727, concerning the Women's Court pilot program, proposes appropriations for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027.  Specific amounts are not finalized in the provided documents, but proposed funding includes $145,000 for a 1.0 FTE clinical psychologist and $76,788 for a 1.0 FTE social worker/human services professional in the First Circuit, with additional funding requested for expansion to other circuits, including $221,788 for the Kona division of the Third Circuit.  Further appropriations are mentioned for additional positions (e.g., judicial clerks) and for mental health, substance abuse treatment, and other services and equipment, with amounts for FY2025-2026 and FY2026-2027 specified in some documents as $514,900 and $557,000 respectively, but these figures are subject to change pending legislative action.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The financial projections for the Women's Court pilot program are based on staffing requirements derived from the existing First Circuit pilot project.  These requirements include specific FTE positions (e.g., Clinical Psychologist, Social Worker) with associated salary costs detailed in documents 3, 4, 17, and 24, totaling approximately $801,802 for the First Circuit and $221,788 for the Kona division (Document 22).  Additional costs for technology (Documents 14, 15, 27, 29, 30), training (Document 1), and program evaluation (Document 1) are also included, resulting in a total estimated budget of over $1.5 million for a three-year pilot (Document 7).",
  "agency_impact": "The Department of Health (DOH) anticipates that the measure will expand services and require additional staff support, specifically within the Adult Mental Health Division and the Women's Court pilot program.  This expansion necessitates an appropriation of $801,802,  allocating funds for three temporary positions (a clinical psychologist, social worker, and social services assistant) in each participating circuit.  The DOH requests that this funding not supplant existing budget requests.",
  "economic_impact": "The Women's Court pilot program, as proposed in HB727, anticipates expanding services and staff support within the Department of Health, contingent on not supplanting the Governor's executive budget request.  The program, with a requested budget of $801,802 initially (for the First Circuit) and later amended to include $221,788 for the Kona division pilot project, aims to provide mental health services, substance abuse treatment, and other support services (including  trauma treatment, family support, life-skills training, education, vocational training, domestic violence prevention, mentoring, and housing support).  While specific cost savings or reductions in related expenditures are not detailed, the program intends to generate community benefits through improved mental health and reduced recidivism among female offenders, although quantifiable performance or participation statistics are currently unavailable.",
  "revenue_sources": "The provided documents indicate that funding for the Women's Court pilot program will come from the general revenues of the State of Hawaii.  Specific appropriations are requested for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027, with figures of $514,900 and $557,000 respectively mentioned in relation to the Kona division pilot project.  The exact total amount appropriated remains unspecified in the provided documents, indicated only as \"$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 or so much thereof as may be necessary\" for each fiscal year.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "Six-Year Fiscal Implications:  The provided documents offer insufficient data for a complete six-year fiscal projection for the Women's Court Pilot Program.  The available information focuses primarily on the first two years (FY2025-2026 and FY2026-2027).  Document 10 shows appropriations of $514,900 for FY2025-2026 and $557,000 for FY2026-2027 for mental health, substance abuse treatment, and other services, plus one FTE temporary position.  Document 7 and 8 detail additional costs for the First Circuit pilot program, totaling $801,802, encompassing 1.0 FTE Clinical Psychologist ($145,000) and 1.0 FTE Social Worker/Human Services Professional IV ($76,788) positions.  Document 12 mentions a separate $221,788 budget for the Kona division pilot project.  Document 27 suggests a total three-year budget of over $1.5 million for the Kona Women's Court (KWC).  However, these figures do not represent a comprehensive overview of all costs, and no information is provided beyond FY2026-2027.  The program's sunset date is June 30, 2027 (Document 11), implying no recurring expenses beyond that date unless the program is extended.  Assumptions regarding program expansion or permanence beyond FY2026-2027 are impossible to make without further budgetary and workload data.  A detailed breakdown of recurring expenses (e.g., operational costs, supplies, training) is also missing.  Finally, the documents do not specify staffing changes beyond the initial temporary positions mentioned.  To create a complete six-year projection, additional budgetary information, including projected caseloads, program expansion plans, and operational costs, is required.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The provided documents detail a Women's Court Pilot Program with a sunset clause of June 30, 2027.  Therefore, there are no explicitly stated ongoing fiscal obligations for the Hawaii state government after six years from the program's July 1, 2025 start date.  The documents discuss potential future expansion to other circuits (Second, Fifth, and Hilo division of the Third), but these are contingent upon further legislative action and associated appropriations, and no funding or staffing projections are provided for such expansion beyond the initial pilot program's termination.  The sustainability of funding beyond 2027 is entirely dependent on future legislative decisions.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "This measure is expected to have no direct impact on state operating revenues.  The proposed program, a Women's Court pilot program, requires appropriations from the general revenues of the State of Hawaii, totaling $514,900 for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027, as detailed in Document 9 and Document 30.  These appropriations represent expenditures, not increases in operating revenue.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The provided documents focus primarily on personnel costs (salaries for psychologists, social workers, and other staff) and program operating expenses for the Women's Court pilot program.  No specific capital expenditures for facilities, equipment, or technology infrastructure are detailed in the budget requests or accompanying testimony.  Therefore, the expected capital expenditure impact is currently zero, pending further clarification or amendment to the proposed budget.",
