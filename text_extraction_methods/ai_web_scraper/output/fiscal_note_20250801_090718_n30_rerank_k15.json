  "overview": "HB727, HD1 makes permanent the Women's Court pilot program in the First Circuit and establishes a three-year pilot program in the Kona division of the Third Circuit.  The measure appropriates funds for these programs, including  $514,900 for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027 for the Kona program,  and additional funding for personnel including judicial clerks, a clinical psychologist, and a probation supervisor.  The bill includes a sunset clause of June 30, 2027, for at least some of the appropriated positions.",
  "policy_impact": "HB727 establishes a temporary position within the Women's Court Pilot Program, specifically a Kona drug court probation supervisor,  sunsetted on June 30, 2027.  This modifies existing judicial programs by adding dedicated staff and funding ($514,900 for FY2025-2026 and $557,000 for FY2026-2027) for expanded services including mental health, substance abuse treatment, and other support services (medical, education, mentoring, housing).  The measure aligns with broader legislative strategies to improve the effectiveness of the Women's Court and address the needs of participants, although the exact relationship to other legislative initiatives is not explicitly detailed in the provided documents.",
  "appropriations": "Document 12 proposes an appropriation of $801,802 to the Department of Health for fiscal year 2025-2026,  intended to fund seven temporary positions within the Judiciary.  Additionally,  Document 13 mentions an appropriation from general revenues for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027, but the specific amounts are redacted (\"$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\").  The intended use of these funds is for a women's court pilot program,  with the exact allocation between staffing, technology, or other expenses unspecified.  Further details regarding appropriations for other bills mentioned (HB 395, HB 370, HB 400, HB 401) are unavailable in the provided documents.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The financial projections for this Women's Court Pilot Program are based on estimated staffing costs derived from the Department of Health's requests for  1.0 FTE Clinical Psychologist ($145,000), 1.0 FTE Social Worker/Human Services Professional IV ($76,788), and 1.0 FTE Social Services Assistant V ($45,216) positions per circuit,  as detailed in testimony submitted to the legislature (Documents 12, 14, 15).  Additional costs include training ($5,000), technology ($4,900), and program evaluation ($10,000) as shown in Document 5, resulting in a total estimated budget of $514,900 for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027 (Document 8).  These figures are further supported by other submitted budget proposals ranging from $801,802 (Document 14) to a three-year projection (Document 9) but lack sufficient detail to fully reconcile discrepancies.",
  "agency_impact": "The Department of Health (DOH) anticipates that the measure will expand services and require additional staff support, contingent upon the measure not supplanting requests in the Governor's executive budget.  This would necessitate increased operational costs for the DOH, specifically within the Adult Mental Health Division,  requiring allocation of resources for new positions such as a clinical psychologist, social worker, and social services assistant, as detailed in the proposed $801,802 budget.  The exact budgetary impact on supervision and resource allocation will depend on the final appropriation.",
  "economic_impact": "This measure is expected to expand services and staff support for the Women's Court Pilot Program, primarily focusing on mental health, substance abuse treatment, and related services.  The program will address areas such as trauma treatment, family support, life skills training, and housing support.  Funding of $514,900 for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027 is appropriated,  along with the creation of at least one full-time equivalent temporary position (a Kona drug court probation supervisor),  potentially leading to cost savings in related expenditures through improved outcomes and reduced recidivism in the long term; however,  precise cost savings and participation statistics are not available in the provided documents.",
  "revenue_sources": "The primary funding source for the program outlined in HB727, HD1 is the general revenues of the State of Hawaii.  Document 5 and Document 11 specifically state that appropriations will be made \"out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii\" for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027.  The exact amount is not specified in the provided documents, only indicated as \"$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 or so much thereof as may be necessary\".  No other funding sources, such as grants or fees, are mentioned.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The provided documents offer insufficient information to create a complete six-year fiscal outlook for the Women's Court Pilot Program.  The available data focuses primarily on the first two years (FY2025-2026 and FY2026-2027).  Document 6 specifies appropriations of $514,900 for FY2025-2026 and $557,000 for FY2026-2027, covering mental health, substance abuse treatment, services, equipment, and one full-time equivalent (FTE) Kona drug court probation supervisor position.  Document 15 mentions a total three-year budget of just over $1.5 million for the Kona Women's Court (KWC) pilot project, implying additional funding beyond the amounts in Document 6. However, the breakdown of this $1.5 million across the three years is not provided.  Furthermore,  Documents 1, 7, and 10 reference additional temporary positions (e.g., peer specialist, clinical psychologist, judicial clerks) with unspecified associated costs for FY2025-2026 and FY2026-2027.  The documents do not provide any information regarding costs or staffing beyond the initial three years of the pilot program, nor do they address assumptions about program expansion or permanence after the pilot period.  To generate a complete six-year fiscal outlook, detailed cost breakdowns for all positions, recurring expenses (e.g., ongoing program services, equipment maintenance), and a clear statement regarding the program's continuation beyond the initial three years are needed.  Without this information, a comprehensive six-year projection is impossible.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "Insufficient information is available in the provided documents to determine the ongoing fiscal obligations of the Women's Court Pilot Program after June 30, 2027.  The documents detail funding for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027, and specify that the program sunsets on June 30, 2027.  No information is provided regarding potential extensions, continued operating costs beyond this date, the number of program sites or units after the pilot program concludes, or the source of funding for any potential continuation of the program.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "This measure is not anticipated to have any direct impact on state operating revenues.  The proposed appropriations of $514,900 for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027 are for expanding mental health and substance abuse treatment services and equipment, and for establishing temporary positions within the Women's Court Pilot Program.  These are expenditures, not revenue generating activities.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The provided documents primarily focus on operational budget requests for the Women's Court pilot program, specifying personnel costs (e.g., clinical psychologist, social worker) and associated salaries.  No information regarding capital expenditures for facilities, equipment, or technology infrastructure is included in the budget requests or supporting testimony.  Therefore, the expected capital expenditure impact of this measure is currently unknown and requires further investigation.",
