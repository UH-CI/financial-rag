The candidate text is completely incorrect and contradicts the most critical information in the gold standard text.

The gold standard explicitly states that the measure makes the First Circuit Women's Court **permanent**. The candidate text incorrectly states that the program is **temporary** and has a sunset date. This is a fundamental contradiction.

Furthermore, the candidate text misses all other key details:
*   It fails to mention the history of the program under Act 243, SLH 2022.
*   It does not specify that the *First Circuit* program is the one being made permanent.
*   It completely misses the establishment of a *new* pilot program in the Third Circuit (Kona Division)."

- It completely fails to mention the primary purpose of the measure: to permanently establish the Women's Court Program in the First Circuit.
- It incorrectly states the Kona pilot program is for three years, whereas the reference text specifies a two-year pilot program.
- It misrepresents the required reports, stating they are about the status of the Kona program, when the reference clearly states they are about the need and costs for establishing courts in entirely different circuits (Hilo, Second, and Fifth).

While it correctly identifies a pilot program in Kona and the sunset date, the multiple major factual errors and the omission of the bill's main provision make it a very poor summary."

The candidate text does the exact opposite. It states that a six-year projection is impossible due to incomplete data and the program's temporary nature. It completely misses the core logic, assumptions, and financial figures ($695,236 pilot cost, $705,416 recurring cost) that form the basis of the gold standard's analysis.

- The projection that three new pilot programs will be created within the six-year period.

Instead, the candidate text states that a six-year projection *cannot* be provided due to incomplete data, which is the direct opposite of the gold standard's purpose and content. It quotes different figures for a different program (Kona division), making it factually divergent and contradictory."

The candidate text is a very poor summary of the gold standard, containing a significant factual error and omitting the majority of the key information.

- **Missing Critical Information:** The candidate completely fails to mention the primary purpose of the measure: to permanently establish the Women's Court Program in the First Circuit. It also omits the requirement for reports to the legislature concerning other circuits.
- **Factual Contradiction:** The candidate incorrectly states the pilot program is for three years, while the gold standard explicitly says it is a two-year program.

- It does not mention the establishment of a new pilot program in the Third Circuit.

In contrast, the candidate text states that a six-year projection is impossible due to incomplete data.

The candidate text is completely incorrect and contradicts the gold standard reference. It incorrectly identifies the impacted agency as the Department of Health (DOH) and details a DOH funding request. The gold standard clearly states the program is supervised by and funded through the Judiciary, specifically the Big Island Drug Court.

The candidate text is completely incorrect and appears to be summarizing a different part of the fiscal note. It misses every single key piece of information from the gold standard text, including:
- The specific cost of incarceration ($277,035) which is the core of the economic impact argument.
- The program's goal of keeping women out of prison to reduce costs for the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.
- All statistics regarding referrals, participants, and graduates.

Furthermore, the candidate text directly contradicts the gold standard by stating that ""specific cost savings or reductions in related expenditures are not detailed,"" when the gold standard's primary point is the specific cost savings from avoiding incarceration. The candidate introduces unrelated information about appropriations and a new position, which are not mentioned in the reference text for this field."

The candidate text is completely incorrect and contradicts the gold standard on the most critical point. The gold standard clearly states that the measure makes the First Circuit Women's Court *permanent*. The candidate text incorrectly states that it establishes a *temporary* program. It also misses several other key facts, such as the context of Act 243, the establishment of a new pilot program in the Kona Division of the Third Circuit, and the long-term goal of a statewide rollout. The information it does include about funding and personnel is not present in the gold standard text."

The candidate text misses one of the two primary purposes of the measure: permanently establishing the Women's Court Program in the First Circuit. This is a critical omission.

Additionally, the candidate text contains a factual error, stating the Kona pilot program is for three years, while the gold standard correctly identifies it as a two-year pilot program.

While it correctly mentions the sunset date and the requirement for a report, it misses the key details of which circuits the report should cover. The inclusion of specific appropriation amounts does not compensate for the missing core information and the factual error."

Second, it includes a large amount of irrelevant information about other programs, bills, and budget requests, framing the correct information as just one part of a ""fragmented"" picture, which is not the case in the focused gold standard text."

The candidate text is completely incorrect and appears to be summarizing a different document altogether. It contradicts the gold standard on nearly every key point.

- **Methodology:** The gold standard states the cost is calculated by ""mirroring"" the cost of a pilot program. The candidate text claims it's based on ""staffing requirements"" and ""extrapolated.""
- **Scope:** The gold standard applies the cost to the ""Kona Division."" The candidate text incorrectly states it is to ""encompass other circuits.""
- **Cost Details:** The gold standard mentions costs for ""supplies, technological devices and workstations, as well as contractor costs."" The candidate text introduces entirely different and highly specific costs not mentioned in the reference, such as a Clinical Psychologist FTE, a Social Worker FTE, training, and program evaluation, including specific dollar amounts.
- **Source of Detail:** The gold standard refers to ""Table 1,"" while the candidate refers to numerous ""Documents.""

The candidate text fails to capture any of the specific information from the gold standard and instead provides a completely different set of facts."

The candidate text is completely incorrect and fails to capture any of the specific factual information from the gold standard.

- **Missing Critical Data:** The candidate text omits all key figures from the gold standard, including the cost of incarceration ($277,035), the program's annual goal (20 women), and the specific participant numbers (83 referrals, 11 in phase one, 12 in phase two, 6 graduates).
- **Direct Contradiction:** The candidate text incorrectly states that ""specific cost savings or community benefit quantifications are absent,"" which directly contradicts the gold standard's provision of a precise cost-of-incarceration figure that grounds the entire economic impact argument.
- **Factual Inaccuracy:** The candidate describes the program as a ""proposed pilot program,"" whereas the gold standard presents it as an existing, operational program with historical data.
- **Extraneous Information:** The candidate includes information about a requested budget and specific staffing roles that are not mentioned in the gold standard text."

The candidate text is completely incorrect and does not contain any of the key policy impacts described in the gold standard text. The candidate focuses on fiscal appropriations and administrative details (staffing, Dept. of Health services), which belong in different sections of a fiscal note analysis.

The gold standard clearly outlines the core policy changes:
1.  Making the First Circuit Women's Court permanent.
2.  Removing the previous sunset date.
3.  Establishing a *new* pilot program in the Third Circuit (Kona).
4.  Stating the intent for a phased statewide rollout.

The candidate text misses every single one of these critical points, making it entirely irrelevant as a summary of the bill's policy impact."

The candidate text correctly identifies that the revenue source is State General Funds (""general revenues of the State of Hawaii"").
