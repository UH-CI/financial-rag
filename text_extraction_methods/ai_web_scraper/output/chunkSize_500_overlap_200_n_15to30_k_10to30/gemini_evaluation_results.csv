The candidate text is completely incorrect and contradicts the most critical information in the gold standard text.

The gold standard explicitly states that the measure makes the First Circuit Women's Court **permanent**. The candidate text incorrectly states that the program is **temporary** and has a sunset date. This is a fundamental contradiction.

Furthermore, the candidate text misses all other key details:
*   It fails to mention the history of the program under Act 243, SLH 2022.

- It misrepresents the required reports, stating they are about the status of the Kona program, when the reference clearly states they are about the need and costs for establishing courts in entirely different circuits (Hilo, Second, and Fifth).

While it correctly identifies a pilot program in Kona and the sunset date, the multiple major factual errors and the omission of the bill's main provision make it a very poor summary."

The candidate text does the exact opposite. It states that a six-year projection is impossible due to incomplete data and the program's temporary nature. It completely misses the core logic, assumptions, and financial figures ($695,236 pilot cost, $705,416 recurring cost) that form the basis of the gold standard's analysis.

The candidate text is completely incorrect and shares no factual information with the gold standard text. The gold standard focuses on the economic impact as cost *savings* for the Department of Corrections by avoiding incarceration ($277,035 per person) and provides specific program statistics (referrals, participants, graduates). In contrast, the candidate text discusses the *costs* of a proposed program ($801,802 budget), staff salaries, and the Department of Health. It directly contradicts the gold standard by stating that cost savings are not specified. The two texts describe entirely different economic impacts."
fiscal_note_20250801_090615_n25_rerank_k30.json,policy_impact,1.0,"The candidate text is completely incorrect as it entirely misses the primary policy impacts described in the gold standard.

The gold standard clearly states the bill has two main policy effects:
1.  Making the existing First Circuit Women's Court permanent.
2.  Establishing a new pilot program in the Third Circuit (Kona).

The candidate text fails to mention the crucial fact that the First Circuit program is being made permanent. It only mentions the creation of the Kona pilot program and then fills the rest of the text with fiscal and administrative details (appropriations, new positions, reporting requirements) that are not part of the policy impact described in the gold standard.

Key points from the gold standard that are entirely missing from the candidate:
- The core assumption that the program will become statewide through a phased rollout.
- The use of the First Circuit Court's program as a model for costs.
- The specific cost figures for the First Circuit's pilot ($695,236) and permanent ($705,416) programs.
- The projection that three new pilot programs will be created within the six-year period.

Instead, the candidate text states that a six-year projection *cannot* be provided due to incomplete data, which is the direct opposite of the gold standard's purpose and content. It quotes different figures for a different program (Kona division), making it factually divergent and contradictory."

- **Missing Critical Information:** The candidate completely fails to mention the primary purpose of the measure: to permanently establish the Women's Court Program in the First Circuit. It also omits the requirement for reports to the legislature concerning other circuits.
- **Factual Contradiction:** The candidate incorrectly states the pilot program is for three years, while the gold standard explicitly says it is a two-year program.

- **Application:** The gold standard specifies the costs are applied to the ""Kona Division,"" which is entirely missing from the candidate text.

It provides specific cost figures for pilot ($695,236) and permanent ($705,416) programs and outlines a plan for three new pilot programs over the period.

In contrast, the candidate text states that a six-year projection is impossible due to incomplete data. It quotes entirely different and fragmented cost figures from various source documents and concludes that no assumptions can be made about expansion. It completely misses the central logic, assumptions, and financial figures of the gold standard, making it a total failure."
