  "overview": "HB727 establishes a three-year Women's Court Pilot Program in Kona, Third Circuit,  appropriating $514,900 for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027.  This includes funding for a temporary full-time equivalent Kona drug court probation supervisor position and additional funding for mental health, substance abuse treatment, and other services and equipment. The program sunsets on June 30, 2027.",
  "policy_impact": "This measure establishes a temporary position for a Kona drug court probation supervisor within the Women's Court Pilot Program in the Kona division of the Third Circuit, expiring June 30, 2027.  It modifies existing programs by appropriating $514,900 for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027 for mental health, substance abuse treatment, and other services and equipment related to this position.  The policy aligns with broader legislative strategies to expand services within the Department of Health, contingent upon not supplanting existing budget requests.",
  "appropriations": "Document 1 mentions emergency appropriations for fiscal year 2024-2025 for the Department of Accounting and General Services and the Judiciary, covering payroll and fringe benefits for Department of Law Enforcement personnel.  The exact amount is not specified. Document 10 indicates an appropriation from general revenues for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027,  with the amount left unspecified, for four full-time equivalent judicial clerk positions within a women's court pilot program.  Other documents reference appropriations for various measures (HB 370, HB 395, HB 727) related to elections and partial public financing, but specific amounts and intended uses are not detailed.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal projections for this program, a women's court pilot program (HB727, HD1), are based on estimated costs for personnel (including a clinical psychologist and judicial clerks \u2013 FTEs are specified but the exact number and associated costs are not provided in the available documents), training ($5,000-$10,000 depending on the document), technology ($4,900), and program evaluation ($10,000).  The provided budget figures vary across documents ($557,000 to $1,071,900 for unspecified timeframes), indicating inconsistencies that require clarification.  Further, the methodology for calculating personnel costs is not explicitly detailed, and no comparable programs or historical budget data are referenced for comparison.",
  "agency_impact": "The Department of Health (DOH) anticipates that the measure will allow for the expansion of services and increased staff support within the Adult Mental Health Division.  This expansion is contingent upon the measure not supplanting funding requests already outlined in the Governor's executive budget.  The exact budgetary impact on DOH, including specific staffing levels and resource allocation, requires further clarification as no specific figures beyond an $801,802 appropriation request for the Department of Health are provided in the available documents.",
  "economic_impact": "This measure, establishing a three-year Women's Court Pilot Program in Kona and potentially expanding to other circuits, is projected to cost $514,900 in fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 in fiscal year 2026-2027.  The program anticipates expanding mental health and substance abuse services, including staff support (e.g., a clinical psychologist and social worker),  leading to potential cost savings in related expenditures through improved outcomes and reduced recidivism.  However,  precise figures regarding cost savings and community benefits (e.g., reduced crime rates, improved community well-being) are not available in the provided documents.",
  "revenue_sources": "The provided documents indicate that funding for the program (implied to be related to HB727, concerning a Women's Court Pilot Program and mental health services) will be appropriated from the general revenues of the State of Hawaii.  Document 6 and Document 7 specifically mention appropriations of  \"$514,900 for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027\" for mental health, substance abuse treatment, and related services and personnel.  The documents also state that the requested funding should not supplant existing requests within the Governor's executive budget, suggesting that the appropriation will be an addition to, rather than a replacement of, existing funding streams.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The provided documents offer insufficient information to create a complete six-year fiscal outlook for the Women's Court Pilot Program.  While documents 5, 6, 8, and 10 mention funding requests and staffing needs for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027,  no data is available beyond this biennium.  Specifically,  document 5 shows appropriations of $514,900 for FY2025-2026 and $557,000 for FY2026-2027, including one temporary FTE position.  Document 10 details a separate funding request of $801,802, encompassing 1.0 FTE Clinical Psychologist and 1.0 FTE Social Worker/Human Services Professional IV positions. Document 8 mentions a separate $221,788 budget request for the Kona division.  These figures represent only a portion of the total costs, and the documents do not specify recurring expenses beyond the initial two years.  Furthermore, there is no information regarding program expansion, potential sunset provisions beyond the stated 6/30/2027 date (Document 9), or assumptions about the program's long-term permanence.  To generate a six-year projection, additional data on projected caseloads, inflation adjustments, salary increases, and potential program extensions or modifications are needed.  Without this information, a comprehensive six-year fiscal outlook cannot be reliably produced.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "Insufficient information is available in the provided documents to determine the ongoing fiscal obligations after the initial six-year period (FY2025-2027) for the women's court pilot program.  The documents detail funding requests for FY2025-2026 and FY2026-2027, and indicate the program sunsets on June 30, 2027 (Document 8).  No information is provided regarding potential annual operating costs, the number of program sites or units beyond this date, or the source of funding for the program's continuation after the sunset date.  Therefore, a comprehensive analysis of fiscal implications after six years cannot be completed.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The provided documents do not contain information on anticipated impacts to operating revenues from the proposed program (HB727).  The documents focus on appropriations from the general revenues of the State of Hawaii to fund the program, specifically mentioning $514,900 for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027 for mental health, substance abuse treatment, and other services.  There is no mention of any changes to existing revenue streams or the generation of new revenue sources as a result of this program.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The provided documents focus on operational budget requests for the Women's Court pilot program, specifically staffing costs for clinical psychologists and social workers.  No information is available regarding capital expenditures for facilities, equipment, or technology infrastructure related to this program.  Therefore, the capital expenditure impact of this measure is unknown and requires further information from the Department of Health or relevant capital budget documents.",
