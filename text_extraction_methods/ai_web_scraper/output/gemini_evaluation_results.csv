- **Contradictory Methodology:** The gold standard states the costs are based on the ""First Circuit Court pilot program,"" while the candidate states they are from the ""Department of Health's proposed budget.""
- **Contradictory Cost Details:** The candidate text provides very specific, but completely different, cost breakdowns (e.g., Clinical Psychologist salary, specific training costs, total appropriations). The gold text mentions supplies, workstations, and contractor costs, none of which are in the candidate text.
- **Missing Critical Information:** The candidate text fails to mention that the cost approximations are being applied to the ""Kona Division,"" a key detail from the gold standard.
- **Incorrect Reference:** The gold standard refers to ""Table 1"" for the cost breakdown, whereas the candidate cites multiple ""Documents.""

In contrast, the candidate text states that there is insufficient information to create a six-year projection, cites completely different cost figures for a different program (Kona division), and claims information on long-term permanence and expansion is missing, when the gold standard explicitly makes assumptions about these very points to build its forecast."

- **Missing Information:** It completely omits the two most significant components from the gold standard: 1) the permanent establishment of the Women's Court Program in the First Circuit, and 2) the requirement for reports to the legislature on the need for courts in other circuits.
- **Factual Error:** It incorrectly states the pilot program is for three years, while the gold standard explicitly says it is a two-year program.

However, it incorrectly describes the purpose of the funds, listing different items (e.g., ""one full-time equivalent temporary probation supervisor position"") than the gold standard (e.g., ""training of program staff,"" ""contract vendors"").

- **Cost Components:** The gold standard identifies costs for ""supplies, technological devices and workstations, as well as contractor costs."" The candidate text invents completely different cost categories, including specific personnel positions (Clinical Psychologist, Social Worker) and large dollar amounts that are absent from the reference text.
- **Source of Information:** The gold standard refers to a ""Table 1"" for a cost breakdown, while the candidate refers to multiple different ""Documents.""
