  "overview": "HB727 establishes a three-year Women's Court Pilot Program in the Kona division of the Third Circuit,  appropriating $514,900 for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027.  This funding covers mental health and substance abuse services, other program needs, and one full-time equivalent temporary Kona drug court probation supervisor position; the program sunsets on June 30, 2027.",
  "policy_impact": "HB727, HD1, SD2 modifies existing programs by appropriating $514,900 for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027 for the Women's Court Pilot Program in Kona.  This appropriation, intended to expand services including staff support (specifically a Kona drug court probation supervisor position), aligns with broader legislative strategies to address mental health, substance abuse treatment, and related services.  The measure's impact on state governance is the establishment of a temporary position within the Judiciary, sunsetting on 6/30/2027, contingent on not supplanting requests in the Governor's executive budget.",
  "appropriations": "The provided documents offer fragmented information regarding appropriations, hindering a complete picture.  Document 13 mentions an appropriation of $514,900 for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027 for the Women's Court Pilot Program in Kona, specifically for mental health, substance abuse treatment, services, equipment, and one full-time equivalent temporary probation supervisor position.  Documents 2 and 3 detail a requested budget of $801,802 for the Women's Court pilot program in the First Circuit, allocating funds for 1.0 FTE Clinical Psychologist ($145,000) and 1.0 FTE Social Worker/Human Services Professional IV ($76,788).  However, the actual appropriated amounts for these positions and for the program overall across all fiscal years are not explicitly stated in the provided text.  Further,  the documents reference other appropriations (e.g., for law enforcement personnel in Document 1 and for partial public financing of elections in Documents 8-10, 15), but lack specific financial details.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The financial projections for the Women's Court pilot program are based on staffing requirements for the existing First Circuit pilot project,  extrapolated to encompass all circuits.  Cost estimates for personnel (e.g., Clinical Psychologist at $145,000 FTE, Social Worker/Human Services Professional IV at $76,788 FTE) are derived from departmental budget requests (Documents 3, 4) and  include additional appropriations to fully fund a three-year pilot program (Document 7), totaling just over $1.5 million.  Additional costs for training, technology, and program evaluation are estimated separately (Document 1), but lack detailed justification within the provided documents.",
  "agency_impact": "The Department of Health (DOH) requests funding to expand services and staff support, contingent on the measure not supplanting requests in the Governor's executive budget.  This would necessitate additional resource allocation within the DOH's Adult Mental Health Division, potentially requiring increased staffing and supervision.  Specific budgetary figures are not provided in the available documents, but the request is for funding to support service expansion.",
  "economic_impact": "The proposed Women's Court pilot program, with an allocated budget of $514,900 for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027, is expected to generate community benefits through expanded mental health, substance abuse treatment, and other support services.  This expansion includes the addition of 1.0 FTE Clinical Psychologist and 1.0 FTE Social Worker/Human Services Professional IV positions in each circuit,  aimed at improving outcomes for participants.  However,  a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis, including potential reductions in related expenditures (e.g., incarceration costs), is currently unavailable in the provided documents.",
  "revenue_sources": "The primary funding source for the Women's Court pilot program, as detailed in the provided documents (specifically documents 5, 7, 8, 13, and 14), is the general revenues of the State of Hawaii.  Documents 7 and 8 specify a requested budget of $801,802 for the program's expansion,  while document 13 appropriates $514,900 for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027.  The exact amounts appropriated are not fully specified in all documents, indicated by placeholders like \"$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\" in documents 5 and 14, requiring further clarification from the complete legislative bill text.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "Six-Year Fiscal Implications:  The provided documents offer insufficient data for a complete six-year fiscal projection for the Women's Court pilot program.  The available information focuses primarily on the 2025-2026 and 2026-2027 biennium.  Document 10 shows appropriations of $514,900 for FY2025-2026 and $557,000 for FY2026-2027 for the Kona division,  while Document 7 and 8 detail a requested budget of $801,802 for the First Circuit, encompassing 1.0 FTE Clinical Psychologist ($145,000) and 1.0 FTE Social Worker/Human Services Professional IV ($76,788).  Document 12 mentions an additional $221,788 for the Kona division.  These figures represent only a portion of the total program costs, and the exact breakdown of expenses (e.g., salaries, benefits, operating costs) is not provided.  Furthermore, there is no information on staffing beyond the specified FTE positions, potential program expansion beyond the First and Third Circuits, or assumptions regarding the program's long-term continuation past the June 30, 2027 sunset clause (Document 11).  To generate a six-year projection, additional data on recurring expenses, potential expansion to other circuits, and assumptions about the program's future beyond FY2026-2027 are needed.  Without this information, a comprehensive six-year fiscal outlook cannot be reliably produced.  The available data only allows for a partial projection limited to the initial two fiscal years.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "After June 30, 2027, the program established by HB727 will cease to exist due to its sunset provision.  Therefore, there will be no ongoing annual operating costs, program sites, or units after this date.  The sustainability of funding is irrelevant as the program is explicitly temporary and funding is not expected to continue beyond the specified timeframe.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "This measure is not anticipated to generate any increases in operating revenues for the State of Hawaii.  The documents detail appropriations for the Women's Court pilot program, focusing on expenditures for staffing (clinical psychologists, social workers) and other program services.  No provisions are included that would generate new revenue streams or increase existing ones.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The provided documents do not contain information on capital expenditures for the Women's Court pilot program.  The documents primarily focus on personnel costs (FTEs for clinical psychologists and social workers) and associated operational budget requests totaling approximately $801,802 (Documents 1, 2) and an additional $221,788 for a Kona division pilot project (Document 11).  A three-year total budget of just over $1.5 million is mentioned (Document 10), but this figure encompasses operational costs and does not specify any capital investments in facilities, equipment, or technology.  Therefore, a detailed breakdown of capital expenditure impact is unavailable based on the provided information.",
