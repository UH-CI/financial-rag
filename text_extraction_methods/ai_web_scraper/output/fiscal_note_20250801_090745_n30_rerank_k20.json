  "overview": "HB727, HD1 makes permanent the Women's Court pilot program in the First Circuit and establishes a three-year pilot program in the Kona division of the Third Circuit.  The measure appropriates funds for these programs, including  $514,900 for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027 for the Kona program,  and additional funding for staffing, including  full-time equivalent positions for a clinical psychologist and judicial clerks.  The bill includes a sunset clause of June 30, 2027, for at least some of the appropriated funds.",
  "policy_impact": "HB727 establishes a Women's Court pilot program, creating temporary positions and appropriating funds ($514,900 for FY2025-2026 and $557,000 for FY2026-2027) for mental health services, substance abuse treatment, and other support services.  This modifies existing judicial processes by introducing a specialized court focused on women, aligning with broader legislative strategies to address women's health and justice issues. The program is temporary, sunsetting on June 30, 2027, requiring a subsequent legislative review and potential extension based on the judiciary's report due in 2026, 2027, and 2028.",
  "appropriations": "Several bills mention appropriations, but specific amounts and intended uses are often incomplete or unspecified.  HB 1045, HD1 makes emergency appropriations for fiscal year 2024-2025 to the Department of Accounting and General Services and the Judiciary for law enforcement personnel payroll and fringe benefits; however, the exact amount is not provided.  Document 12 requests $801,802 for the Department of Health,  and mentions seven temporary positions in the Judiciary, but the Judiciary's appropriation amount is not specified.  Finally,  HB 727, in various versions (HD1, SD2, CD1), includes appropriations for staffing (e.g.,  a Clinical Psychologist and Social Worker in SD2), but the exact amounts are either unspecified or left for further discussion, as noted in Document 17.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal projections for the Women's Court Pilot Program are based on estimated staffing costs derived from the Department of Health's proposed budget of $801,802 for a similar program in the First Circuit (Documents 14, 15, 18).  This figure includes estimated costs for positions such as a Clinical Psychologist ($145,000), Social Worker ($76,788), and Social Services Assistant ($45,216) (Documents 12, 14, 15, 18).  Additional costs, including technology ($4,900) and training ($10,000), are also included, resulting in total appropriations of $514,900 for FY2025-2026 and $557,000 for FY2026-2027 (Document 8, 5).",
  "agency_impact": "The Department of Health (DOH) anticipates that the proposed measure will necessitate an increase in operational costs and staffing to expand services for the Women's Court pilot program.  This expansion requires an additional $801,802 in funding for fiscal year 2025-2026 and the same amount for 2026-2027, specifically allocating for three temporary positions: a clinical psychologist ($145,000), a social worker/human services professional IV ($76,788), and a social services assistant V ($45,216).  The DOH requests that this funding be considered supplemental to its existing budget request and not replace already planned expenditures.",
  "economic_impact": "This measure is expected to expand services for the Women's Court Pilot Program, including staff support for mental health, substance abuse treatment, and other services.  The Department of Health requests funding of $801,802 for the program's expansion, based on staffing requirements mirroring the existing First Circuit pilot project.  This expansion should lead to improved community well-being by providing enhanced support and treatment for participants, although specific performance or participation statistics are not provided in the available documents.",
  "revenue_sources": "The primary funding source for the program outlined in HB727, HD1 is the general revenues of the State of Hawaii.  Specific appropriations are mentioned for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027, with amounts to be determined, for equipment, mental health and substance abuse treatment services, and the establishment of temporary positions.  No other revenue streams, such as grants or fees, are identified in the provided documents.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The provided documents offer insufficient information to create a complete six-year fiscal outlook for the Women's Court Pilot Program.  The available data focuses primarily on the initial two years (FY2025-2026 and FY2026-2027).  Document 6 shows an appropriation of $514,900 for FY2025-2026 and $557,000 for FY2026-2027 for the Kona division,  covering mental health, substance abuse treatment, services, equipment, and one FTE temporary Kona drug court probation supervisor position.  Document 15 mentions a total three-year budget of just over $1.5 million for the Kona Women's Court (KWC) pilot project, implying additional funding beyond the initial two years.  However, the exact breakdown for FY2027-2028, FY2028-2029, FY2029-2030, and beyond is not specified.  Furthermore, the documents mention additional positions (e.g.,  a peer specialist, clinical psychologist, social worker) and associated costs for the Department of Health, but the exact figures and their allocation across the six-year period are missing.  The documents also lack information on recurring expenses beyond the initial two years, assumptions about program expansion (beyond the Kona division), and the program's long-term permanence.  To generate a complete six-year fiscal outlook, additional budgetary data and legislative intent regarding the program's continuation beyond FY2026-2027 are required.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "Insufficient information is provided to determine the ongoing fiscal obligations of the Women's Court Pilot Program after June 30, 2027.  The provided documents detail appropriations for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027, and specify that the program sunsets on June 30, 2027.  No information regarding annual operating costs beyond this date, the number of program sites after the pilot program concludes, or the potential for continued funding is available in the provided text.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "This measure is not anticipated to have any direct impact on state operating revenues.  The proposed appropriations of $514,900 for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027 are for expenditures related to the Women's Court Pilot Program, specifically for mental health services, substance abuse treatment, equipment, and personnel costs.  These funds are appropriated from the general revenues of the State of Hawaii and do not represent an increase or decrease in existing revenue streams.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The provided documents focus primarily on personnel costs (salaries for clinical psychologists, social workers, and probation supervisors) and operating expenses for the Women's Court pilot program.  No information is available regarding capital expenditures such as investments in facilities, equipment, or technology infrastructure.  Therefore, the capital expenditure impact of this measure is unknown based on the provided documentation.  Further information from the Department of Health's capital budget or relevant agency plans is needed to assess this aspect of the fiscal impact.",
