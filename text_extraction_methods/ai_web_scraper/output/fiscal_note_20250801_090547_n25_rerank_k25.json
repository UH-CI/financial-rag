  "overview": "HB727 establishes a three-year Women's Court Pilot Program in Kona, Third Circuit, appropriating $514,900 for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027.  This funding covers mental health and substance abuse services, along with the creation of at least one full-time equivalent temporary Kona drug court probation supervisor position. The program sunsets on June 30, 2027, with a requirement for the Judiciary to submit a report to the Legislature by forty days prior to the convening of the regular sessions of 2026, 2027, and 2028, detailing the program's status and recommendations for expansion to other circuits.",
  "policy_impact": "HB727, HD1 establishes a three-year Women's Court Pilot Program in Kona, appropriating $514,900 for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027.  This modifies existing judicial processes by creating a specialized court and  includes funding for a new full-time equivalent temporary Kona drug court probation supervisor position.  The program aims to address the needs of women involved in the justice system, aligning with broader legislative strategies focused on improving access to mental health, substance abuse treatment, and related services, and potentially influencing future statewide Women's Court expansion based on the pilot program's findings and recommendations due in 2026, 2027, and 2028.",
  "appropriations": "HB 727 proposes appropriations for a Women's Court pilot program.  For fiscal year 2025-2026 and 2026-2027, the bill allocates unspecified sums for the program's operation, including the establishment of temporary positions such as a clinical psychologist and social worker (with estimated costs of $145,000 and $76,788 respectively, based on the First Circuit pilot project).  Additional funding of $514,900 for FY 2025-2026 and $557,000 for FY 2026-2027 is appropriated for mental health, substance abuse treatment, other services, equipment, and a probation supervisor position within the Kona division of the Third Circuit.  The exact total appropriations for each fiscal year are not explicitly stated in the provided documents.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The financial projections for the Women's Court pilot program are based on staffing requirements derived from the existing First Circuit pilot project.  Cost estimates for positions, such as the Clinical Psychologist ($145,000 FTE) and Social Worker/Human Services Professional IV ($76,788 FTE), are drawn from departmental budget requests (Documents 3, 4, 17, 22, 24).  Additional costs include training ($5,000 - $47,000, Document 1), technology ($4,900, Document 1), and program evaluation ($10,000, Document 1), with total projected costs varying across documents from $801,802 (Documents 3, 4, 17) to over $1.5 million for a three-year pilot (Document 7).  The lack of detailed breakdown for some cost components limits the precision of the overall projection.",
  "agency_impact": "The Department of Health (DOH) anticipates that HB727, if funded, will allow for the expansion of services related to the Women's Court pilot program.  This expansion would necessitate additional staffing, including at least one full-time equivalent (FTE) clinical psychologist and one FTE social worker/human services professional per circuit, as outlined in DOH testimony requesting $801,802 in funding.  The additional resources would support increased service provision, but the DOH requests that this funding not supplant existing budget requests.",
  "economic_impact": "The proposed Women's Court pilot program anticipates cost savings through improved efficiency in addressing women's court cases and reducing recidivism.  The program, with a requested budget of $801,802 for initial staffing (Documents 8, 9) and further funding requests for additional services (Document 12, totaling $1,071,900 across two fiscal years), aims to expand services including mental health, substance abuse treatment, and housing support (Documents 14, 18, 21, 23).  This should lead to community benefits by reducing the strain on the justice system and improving the well-being of participants, although quantifiable performance or participation statistics are currently unavailable.",
  "revenue_sources": "The provided documents indicate that funding for the Women's Court pilot program will come from the general revenues of the State of Hawaii.  Specific appropriations are requested for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027, with amounts to be determined,  to cover personnel costs (including positions such as clinical psychologist and social worker), technology, training, and program evaluation.  The Department of Health requests that this funding be considered supplemental to, and not in place of, existing budget requests.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "Six-Year Fiscal Implications:  The provided documents offer incomplete data for a full six-year fiscal projection of the Women's Court Pilot Program.  The legislation (HB727) initially appropriates funds for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027.  Document 10 specifies $514,900 for FY2025-2026 and $557,000 for FY2026-2027 for specific program components in Kona.  Document 7 and 8 detail additional proposed funding of $801,802 for the First Circuit, encompassing 1.0 FTE Clinical Psychologist ($145,000) and 1.0 FTE Social Worker/Human Services Professional IV ($76,788) positions.  Document 12 mentions an additional $221,788 for the Kona division.  The program is temporary, sunsetting on 6/30/2027 (Document 11), thus limiting the projection beyond FY2026-2027.  The documents suggest potential expansion to other circuits (Document 22), but lack specific cost estimates for such expansion.  Further, recurring expenses beyond staffing costs (e.g., operational expenses, equipment) are not fully detailed.  Assumptions regarding program permanence beyond the sunset date are currently unavailable.  A comprehensive six-year projection requires additional information on projected workload, program expansion plans, and associated costs for all circuits, including operational and non-personnel expenses.  Without this data, a complete six-year fiscal outlook cannot be provided.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The provided documents detail a temporary program, the Women's Court pilot program, set to sunset on June 30, 2027.  Therefore, there are no ongoing fiscal obligations for the Hawaii state government after six years from the program's July 1, 2025 start date.  The program's funding, including annual operating costs and the number of program sites/units (implied to be limited to one pilot program), is explicitly temporary and not designed for long-term sustainability.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The provided documents do not contain information on anticipated impacts on operating revenues from the proposed program (Women's Court pilot program).  The documents focus on the appropriation of funds for the program's operation, including staffing and equipment costs (e.g., $514,900 for FY2025-2026 and $557,000 for FY2026-2027 are mentioned), but offer no analysis of how the program might increase or decrease existing revenue streams for the state government.  Therefore, no impact on operating revenues can be determined from the available information.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The provided documents primarily focus on personnel costs (salaries for psychologists, social workers, and other staff) associated with the Women's Court pilot program.  Specific capital expenditures for facilities, equipment, or technology infrastructure are not detailed.  Document 22 shows an appropriation of $4,900 for technology in fiscal year 2025-2026 for the Kona division pilot program, but this is a relatively small amount and doesn't represent a significant capital investment.  Further information is needed to fully assess the capital expenditure impact of the proposed program.",
