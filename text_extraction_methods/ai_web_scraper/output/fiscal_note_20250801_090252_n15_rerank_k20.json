  "overview": "HB727 establishes a three-year Women's Court Pilot Program in Kona, Third Circuit,  appropriating $514,900 for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027.  This funding covers mental health and substance abuse services, equipment, and one full-time equivalent temporary Kona drug court probation supervisor position. The program sunsets on June 30, 2027.",
  "policy_impact": "HB727, HD1, SD2 modifies existing programs by establishing a temporary, full-time equivalent Kona drug court probation supervisor position within the Women's Court Pilot Program in the Kona division of the Third Circuit, sunsetting on 6/30/2027.  This measure aligns with broader legislative strategies to expand mental health, substance abuse treatment, and related services, as evidenced by the Department of Health's support and request for funding ($514,900 for FY2025-2026 and $557,000 for FY2026-2027).  The bill's impact on state governance involves the allocation of funds and the temporary expansion of the Judiciary's capacity to address substance abuse within the Women's Court.",
  "appropriations": "The provided documents offer fragmented information regarding appropriations, hindering a complete picture.  Document 13 mentions an appropriation of $514,900 for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027 for the Women's Court Pilot Program in Kona, specifically for mental health, substance abuse treatment, services, equipment, and one full-time equivalent temporary probation supervisor position.  Documents 2 and 3 detail a requested budget of $801,802 for the Women's Court pilot project in the First Circuit, allocating funds for 1.0 FTE Clinical Psychologist ($145,000) and 1.0 FTE Social Worker/Human Services Professional IV ($76,788).  However, the final approved appropriations for these and other programs mentioned (e.g.,  HB 1045, HB 370, HB 395) are not explicitly stated in the provided text;  the exact amounts appropriated for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027 remain unspecified in most instances, with only placeholders like \"$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\" present in relevant bills (Document 11, 12).",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The financial projections for the Women's Court pilot program are based on staffing requirements for the existing First Circuit pilot project,  extrapolated to encompass all circuits.  Cost estimates for personnel include $145,000 for a Clinical Psychologist FTE and $76,788 for a Social Worker/Human Services Professional IV FTE (Documents 3 & 4).  Additional costs, including training and technology, are estimated at $514,900 for the first year and $557,000 for the second year (Document 1), with a three-year total exceeding $1.5 million (Document 7).  However,  specific details regarding the methodology for extrapolating costs across circuits and the basis for the additional costs are not fully detailed in the provided documents.",
  "agency_impact": "The Department of Health (DOH) requests funding to expand services and staff support, contingent on the measure not supplanting requests in the Governor's executive budget.  This would necessitate increased operational costs for the DOH, specifically within the Adult Mental Health Division, requiring allocation of resources for additional staffing and service provision.  The exact budgetary impact remains unspecified pending further details on the program's scope and the Governor's budget.",
  "economic_impact": "The proposed Women's Court pilot program, with an appropriation of $514,900 for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027, is expected to generate community benefits through expanded services including mental health, substance abuse treatment, and other support services.  This expansion will be facilitated by the addition of 1.0 FTE Clinical Psychologist and 1.0 FTE Social Worker/Human Services Professional IV positions in each participating circuit.  However,  the exact cost savings or reductions in related expenditures are not specified in the provided documents.",
  "revenue_sources": "The provided documents indicate that funding for the women's court pilot program will come from the general revenues of the State of Hawaii.  Specific appropriation amounts are not fully detailed in the available text,  with placeholder values like \"$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\" used in several instances. However, Document 13 shows an appropriation of $514,900 for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027 for related mental health, substance abuse treatment, and other services within the program.  Further, Document 7 and 8 mention a Department of Health request for $801,802 based on staffing requirements for the existing pilot project in the First Circuit.  The exact total appropriation remains unclear due to incomplete numerical data in the provided documents.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "Six-Year Fiscal Implications:  The provided documents offer insufficient data for a complete six-year fiscal projection for the Women's Court pilot program.  The available information focuses primarily on the 2025-2026 and 2026-2027 biennium.  Document 10 indicates appropriations of $514,900 for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027.  Document 7 and 8 detail staffing costs for the First Circuit, including $145,000 for a Clinical Psychologist and $76,788 for a Social Worker/Human Services Professional IV, totaling $221,788 per circuit.  Document 12 mentions an additional $221,788 for the Kona division pilot project in the Third Circuit.  However, these figures do not represent the entire program cost, and information regarding other expenses (e.g., operational costs, equipment, training) is missing.  Furthermore, the program's sunset provision on June 30, 2027 (Document 11) limits the projection to only the first three years.  To generate a six-year outlook, additional data is needed on projected program expansion beyond the initial two years, assumptions regarding its potential permanence (or extension beyond the sunset date), and a comprehensive breakdown of all recurring and non-recurring expenses.  Without this information, a reliable six-year fiscal projection cannot be produced.  The available data only allows for a partial projection covering the initial two years of the program's operation.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "After June 30, 2027, the program established by HB727 will cease to exist due to its sunset provision.  Therefore, there are no ongoing fiscal obligations for the Hawaii state government beyond this date.  No annual operating costs, program sites, or units will exist after the program's termination, rendering the question of funding sustainability moot.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The provided documents do not contain information regarding any anticipated impacts on operating revenues for the Hawaii state government resulting from HB727.  The documents focus solely on the budgetary appropriations required for the Women's Court pilot program, detailing personnel costs and equipment needs.  No analysis of increased or decreased revenue streams, or changes in existing revenue sources, is presented.  Therefore, no impact on operating revenues can be determined from the available information.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The provided documents focus on personnel costs (salaries for clinical psychologists and social workers) associated with the Women's Court pilot program and its expansion.  No information regarding capital expenditures for facilities, equipment, or technology infrastructure is included in any of the provided documents.  Therefore, the fiscal note's capital_expenditure_impact section should state that no capital expenditures are anticipated based on the available information.  Further analysis of capital budgets and agency plans is required to determine if any indirect capital costs are associated with this program.",
