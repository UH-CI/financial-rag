  "overview": "HB727 establishes a three-year Women's Court Pilot Program in Kona, Third Circuit,  appropriating $514,900 for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027.  This funding covers mental health and substance abuse services, equipment, and one full-time equivalent temporary Kona drug court probation supervisor position. The program sunsets on June 30, 2027, and  requires a report to the legislature assessing the need for expansion to other circuits.",
  "policy_impact": "HB727, HD1, establishes a temporary position and appropriates $514,900 for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027 for the Women's Court Pilot Program in Kona.  This measure modifies existing programs by expanding services and staff support within the Department of Health's Adult Mental Health Division, specifically for mental health, substance abuse treatment, and related services and equipment.  The bill aligns with broader legislative strategies to improve access to mental health and substance abuse treatment services, potentially impacting state governance by enhancing the effectiveness of the Women's Court.",
  "appropriations": "The provided documents offer fragmented information regarding appropriations, hindering a complete picture.  Document 13 mentions an appropriation of $514,900 for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027 for the Women's Court Pilot Program in Kona, specifically for mental health, substance abuse treatment, services, equipment, and one full-time equivalent temporary probation supervisor position.  Documents 2 and 3 detail a requested budget of $801,802 for the Women's Court pilot program in the First Circuit, allocating funds for 1.0 FTE Clinical Psychologist ($145,000) and 1.0 FTE Social Worker/Human Services Professional IV ($76,788).  However, the final approved appropriations for these and other programs mentioned (e.g.,  HB 1045, HB 370, HB 395) are not explicitly stated in the provided text.  Further, the intended use of funds beyond staffing is unclear for most programs.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The financial projections for the Women's Court pilot program are based on staffing requirements for the existing First Circuit pilot project,  extrapolated to encompass other circuits.  Cost estimates for personnel include $145,000 for a Clinical Psychologist FTE and $76,788 for a Social Worker/Human Services Professional IV FTE (Documents 3 & 4).  Additional costs, including training ($5,000-$10,000), technology ($4,900), and program evaluation ($10,000) are included, with total program costs estimated at over $1.5 million for a three-year pilot (Documents 1, 7, 14, 15).  However, specific details regarding the methodology for extrapolating costs to other circuits and the basis for the additional cost estimates are not fully detailed in the provided documents.",
  "agency_impact": "The Department of Health (DOH) anticipates this measure will allow for the expansion of services and staff support within the Adult Mental Health Division, provided it does not replace funding already requested in the Governor's executive budget.  The specific budgetary impact requires further clarification as no dollar amounts are specified in the provided documents.  Successful implementation depends on securing additional funding and may necessitate adjustments to resource allocation within the DOH.",
  "economic_impact": "The proposed Women's Court pilot program, with a requested budget of $801,802 for initial staffing (including a clinical psychologist and social worker for each circuit), aims to expand services and potentially reduce related expenditures in the long term by addressing the root causes of recidivism among women.  While specific cost savings or community benefit quantifications are absent from the provided documents, the program anticipates improved outcomes through enhanced mental health, substance abuse treatment, and other support services, leading to a potential reduction in future incarceration costs.  The success of the pilot program, as measured by recidivism rates and participant outcomes, will be crucial in determining its long-term economic impact and justifying further funding.",
  "revenue_sources": "The provided documents indicate that funding for the Women's Court pilot program will come from the general revenues of the State of Hawaii.  Specific appropriation amounts are not fully detailed in the available text,  with placeholder values like \"$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\" used in several instances. However, Document 13 shows an appropriation of $514,900 for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027 for related mental health, substance abuse treatment, and other services within the program.  Further, Document 7 and 8 mention a Department of Health request for $801,802 based on staffing requirements for the existing pilot project in the First Circuit, suggesting this figure may also be a component of the overall funding.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "Six-Year Fiscal Implications:  The provided documents offer insufficient data for a complete six-year fiscal projection for the Women's Court pilot program.  The available information focuses primarily on the 2025-2026 and 2026-2027 biennium.  Document 10 shows appropriations of $514,900 for FY2025-2026 and $557,000 for FY2026-2027.  Document 7 and 8 detail staffing costs for the First Circuit, including $145,000 for a Clinical Psychologist and $76,788 for a Social Worker/Human Services Professional IV, totaling $221,788 per circuit.  Document 12 indicates an additional $221,788 for the Kona division pilot project in the Third Circuit.  However, these figures do not represent the total program cost, as other expenses are not specified.  The program is temporary, sunsetting on 6/30/2027 (Document 11), thus limiting the projection beyond FY2026-2027.  To generate a six-year outlook, additional information is needed on recurring operational costs, potential expansion to other circuits beyond the initial two, and assumptions regarding the program's continuation beyond its current sunset date.  Without this information, a comprehensive six-year fiscal projection cannot be reliably produced.  The documents suggest a potential for expansion, contingent on the Governor's budget request (Documents 2, 3, 4, 5), but lack specific financial details for such expansion.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The provided documents detail a temporary program (HB727) sunsetting on June 30, 2027.  Therefore, there are no ongoing fiscal obligations for the Hawaii state government after six years from the program's July 1, 2025, effective date.  Annual operating costs, the number of program sites or units, and the sustainability of funding are all nonexistent beyond the program's explicitly defined two-year lifespan.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The provided documents do not contain information regarding anticipated impacts on operating revenues from the proposed program (Women's Court pilot program).  The documents focus on the program's budget requirements and funding requests, specifying appropriations for personnel (clinical psychologists, social workers, judicial clerks) and equipment, but offer no analysis of how the program might increase or decrease state operating revenues.  Therefore, no impact on operating revenues can be determined from the available information.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The provided documents do not contain information regarding capital expenditures for facilities, equipment, or technology infrastructure related to the Women's Court pilot program (HB727).  The documents primarily focus on personnel costs, specifically requesting funding for FTE clinical psychologist and social worker positions.  Therefore, no capital expenditure impact can be determined from the available information.  Further documentation detailing capital budget allocations or agency plans for this program is required to complete this section of the fiscal note.",
