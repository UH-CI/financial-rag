  "overview": "HB727 establishes a three-year Women's Court Pilot Program in Kona, Third Circuit,  appropriating $514,900 for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027.  This includes funding for four FTE judicial clerk positions, one FTE clinical psychologist position, and one FTE temporary Kona drug court probation supervisor position. The program sunsets on June 30, 2027.",
  "policy_impact": "HB727, as amended (HD1), establishes a temporary position and appropriates funds, specifically $514,900 for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027.  This measure modifies existing programs by adding a full-time equivalent temporary Kona drug court probation supervisor position to the Women's Court Pilot Program within the Third Circuit Court.  The policy aligns with broader legislative strategies to expand mental health, substance abuse treatment, and related services, but its long-term impact on state governance depends on whether funding is renewed beyond the June 30, 2027 sunset date.",
  "appropriations": "HB 1045, HD1 makes emergency appropriations for fiscal year 2024-2025 to the Department of Accounting and General Services and the Judiciary for payroll and fringe benefits of Department of Law Enforcement personnel.  Additionally, HB 727, HD1 proposes an appropriation of $801,802 to the Department of Health,  including funding for seven temporary positions within the Judiciary.  Specific appropriation amounts for other bills mentioned (HB 395, HB 370, HB 400, HB 401) are not provided in the supplied documents, though they reference appropriations related to elections, jury duty, and the judiciary.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The financial projections for this measure, primarily focused on expanding services for the Women's Court Pilot Program, are based on staffing requirements outlined in Department of Health testimony (Documents 11, 13, 14).  These requirements include specific FTE positions with associated salary costs (e.g., $145,000 for a Clinical Psychologist, $76,788 for a Social Worker),  as well as additional funding requests for training ($5,000-$10,000, Document 5), technology ($4,900, Document 5), and program evaluation ($10,000, Document 5).  While specific methodologies for calculating these costs are not explicitly detailed, the figures appear to be derived from existing salary scales and program needs within the Department of Health, referencing the existing Women's Court pilot project in the First Circuit as a comparable program (Documents 13, 14).",
  "agency_impact": "The Department of Health (DOH) anticipates that the measure will expand services and require additional staff support, contingent upon funding not supplanting the Governor's executive budget request.  The DOH requests $801,802 to fund the Women's Court pilot program, specifically for 1.0 FTE Clinical Psychologist ($145,000) and 1.0 FTE Social Worker/Human Services Professional IV ($76,788) positions per circuit.  This funding request is based on staffing needs for the existing First Circuit pilot project and would necessitate resource allocation for supervision and administrative support.",
  "economic_impact": "This measure is expected to generate positive economic effects through the expansion of mental health and substance abuse services in Hawaii.  The appropriation of $514,900 for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027 will fund these services, including the creation of one full-time equivalent temporary Kona drug court probation supervisor position.  Further economic benefits, such as cost savings from reduced recidivism and improved community well-being, are anticipated but require further analysis and data collection, as specific performance metrics are not provided in the available documents.",
  "revenue_sources": "The primary funding source for the program outlined in HB727, HD1 is the general revenues of the State of Hawaii.  Document 5 and Document 11 specifically state appropriations from general revenues for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027, though the exact amounts are not specified.  These funds are intended to cover equipment, mental health and substance abuse treatment services, and the establishment of temporary positions.  No other revenue streams, such as grants or fees, are identified in the provided documents.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "Six-Year Fiscal Implications:  The provided documents offer incomplete data for a full six-year fiscal projection.  The legislation focuses primarily on a three-year Women's Court Pilot Program (FY2025-2027), with appropriations specified for FY2025-2026 and FY2026-2027.  Document 5 indicates $514,900 for FY2025-2026 and $557,000 for FY2026-2027 for mental health, substance abuse treatment, and equipment, plus one temporary FTE position.  Documents 10, 14, and 15 suggest a Department of Health request of $801,802, encompassing 1.0 FTE Clinical Psychologist and 1.0 FTE Social Worker/Human Services Professional IV positions per circuit.  The exact number of circuits involved is not explicitly stated, hindering precise cost calculation.  Document 12 mentions a separate $221,788 budget request for the Kona division pilot project.  The documents lack information on staffing beyond FY2026-2027 and do not project costs or staffing changes beyond the initial three-year pilot program.  Assumptions regarding program expansion or permanence after FY2027 are unavailable.  Further information is needed to project costs and staffing for FY2027-2031.  The absence of a comprehensive budget proposal from the Department of Health prevents a complete six-year fiscal outlook.  The provided figures represent only partial costs for the initial three years of the program and do not account for potential ongoing operational expenses or inflation.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The provided documents detail funding for the Women's Court Pilot Program through June 30, 2027.  Information regarding ongoing fiscal obligations after this date is absent.  Therefore,  annual operating costs beyond FY 2026-2027, the expected number of program sites or units after this period, and the long-term sustainability of funding for the program are all unknown and require further legislative specification.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "This measure is not anticipated to have a direct impact on state operating revenues.  The proposed appropriations totaling $514,900 for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027 are for expanding mental health and substance abuse services and equipment, and establishing temporary positions.  These are expenditures, not revenue generating activities.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The provided documents focus primarily on personnel costs (staffing for clinical psychologists, social workers, and probation supervisors) and operating expenses for the Women's Court pilot program.  No information is available regarding capital expenditures for facilities, equipment, or technology infrastructure related to this program.  Therefore, the capital expenditure impact is undetermined based on the provided documentation.  Further information from the Department of Health's capital budget or relevant agency plans is needed to assess this component of the fiscal note.",
