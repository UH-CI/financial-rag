  "overview": "HB727 establishes a temporary Women's Court pilot program, appropriating $514,900 for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027.  This funding supports the creation of several temporary positions, including a clinical psychologist and a Kona drug court probation supervisor, to expand mental health, substance abuse treatment, and other services. The program is set to sunset on June 30, 2027.",
  "policy_impact": "HB727 establishes a temporary position, a Kona drug court probation supervisor, within the Women's Court Pilot Program in the Kona division of the Third Circuit, sunsetting on June 30, 2027.  This modifies existing programs by adding a dedicated probation supervisor to enhance services and potentially improve outcomes within the Women's Court.  The measure aligns with broader legislative strategies to address mental health, substance abuse, and improve the efficacy of the court system, specifically targeting women in Kona.",
  "appropriations": "The provided documents mention several appropriations but lack specific funding amounts.  HB 1045, HD1 makes emergency appropriations for fiscal year 2024-2025 to the Department of Accounting and General Services and the Judiciary for law enforcement personnel payroll and fringe benefits; however, the exact amount is not specified.  HB 395, HD1, SD1 and HB 370, HD2, SD1  relate to partial public financing of elections and electronic filing for nomination papers, respectively, and include references to appropriations, but no financial figures are provided.  Further, documents referencing the Department of Health requests for funding state that the requests are contingent upon not supplanting the Governor's executive budget request, but the details of those requests are absent from the provided text.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The financial projections for the Women's Court Pilot Program are based on estimated costs for personnel (including a clinical psychologist, judicial clerks, and a probation supervisor), training, technology, and program evaluation.  Specific figures are provided in various documents, totaling $514,900 for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027 (Document 5, Document 8).  These figures appear to be derived from departmental requests (Documents 1-4) and do not explicitly reference comparable programs or historical budget data for similar initiatives within the Hawaii state government.",
  "agency_impact": "The Department of Health (DOH) requests $801,802 in funding to expand services for the Women\u2019s Court pilot program.  This funding would support the addition of 1.0 FTE Clinical Psychologist ($145,000) and 1.0 FTE Social Worker/Human Services Professional IV ($76,788) per circuit,  with the total budget based on the existing First Circuit project's staffing needs.  The DOH emphasizes that this funding should not supplant existing requests within the Governor's executive budget.",
  "economic_impact": "This measure is expected to generate positive economic effects through the expansion of mental health and substance abuse services in Hawaii.  The appropriation of $514,900 for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027 will fund these services, including staff support and the establishment of a new probation supervisor position.  While specific performance metrics are not provided in the available documents, the expansion of services is anticipated to benefit the community by improving access to crucial mental health and substance abuse treatment, potentially leading to cost savings in related areas in the long term (though these savings are not quantified in the provided text).",
  "revenue_sources": "The primary funding source for the program outlined in HB727, HD1 is the general revenues of the State of Hawaii.  Document 5 explicitly states an appropriation \"out of the general revenues\" for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027, although the specific amount is not provided.  No other funding sources, such as grants or fees, are mentioned in the provided documents.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The provided documents offer insufficient information to create a complete six-year fiscal outlook for the program.  Documents 5, 6, 9, and 10 mention appropriations for the Women's Court Pilot Program, specifically $514,900 for FY2025-2026 and $557,000 for FY2026-2027 (Document 5).  These figures include funding for mental health, substance abuse treatment, other services, equipment, and at least one full-time equivalent (FTE) temporary position (Document 5).  Additional FTE positions are referenced (Documents 6 and 9), but the associated costs are not specified.  Document 10 suggests a potential additional appropriation of $801,802 to the Department of Health, but the timeframe is unclear.  The documents also indicate that funding requests are contingent on not supplanting the Governor's executive budget request (Documents 1-4), but the details of that request are absent.  Furthermore, there is no information on projected costs, staffing changes, recurring expenses, or assumptions about program expansion or permanence beyond the initial two fiscal years.  To generate a six-year projection, data on program sustainability, anticipated caseloads, inflation adjustments, and potential expansion plans are needed.  Without this information, a comprehensive six-year fiscal outlook cannot be produced.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The provided documents offer insufficient information to project ongoing fiscal obligations for the Women's Court Pilot Program beyond the initial two-year (FY2025-2026 and FY2026-2027) funding period.  The documents detail appropriations for temporary positions (e.g., clinical psychologist, judicial clerks, probation supervisor) and overall program costs for those two years, but do not specify whether these positions are intended to be permanent, nor do they project annual operating costs, the number of program sites or units after FY2027, or the long-term funding mechanism.  Therefore, a comprehensive analysis of fiscal implications after six years cannot be completed.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The provided documents do not offer information on anticipated impacts on operating revenues from the program described in HB727.  The documents detail appropriations for the program (e.g., $514,900 for FY2025-2026 and $557,000 for FY2026-2027 from the general revenues of the State of Hawaii), focusing on expenditures rather than revenue generation.  Therefore, no increases or decreases in revenue streams can be identified based on the available information.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The provided documents focus primarily on operational expenditures for the Women's Court pilot program, specifically staffing costs for positions such as clinical psychologists and social workers.  Documents 7 and 8 mention appropriations for \"services and equipment,\" but do not provide a breakdown of capital expenditures for facilities, technology, or other infrastructure investments.  Therefore, a precise quantification of capital expenditure impact is impossible based solely on the provided information.  Further details regarding capital budget allocations for this program are needed to complete this section of the fiscal note.",
