  "overview": "HB727 establishes a three-year Women's Court Pilot Program in Kona, Third Circuit, appropriating $514,900 for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027.

The program sunsets on June 30, 2027, and  the Judiciary is not required to submit a report on expanding the program to other circuits.",
  "policy_impact": "HB727, HD1, establishes a temporary position and appropriates $514,900 for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027 for the Women's Court Pilot Program in Kona.  This measure modifies existing programs by expanding services and staff support within the Department of Health's Adult Mental Health Division, specifically for mental health, substance abuse treatment, and related services and equipment.  The bill aligns with broader legislative strategies to improve access to mental health and substance abuse treatment services, potentially enhancing state governance by improving the effectiveness of the Women's Court.",
  "appropriations": "The provided documents offer fragmented information regarding appropriations, hindering a complete picture.  Document 13 shows an appropriation of $514,900 for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027 for the Women's Court Pilot Program in Kona.  This funding is designated for mental health, substance abuse treatment, other services, equipment, and one full-time equivalent temporary probation supervisor position.  Documents 2 and 3 mention a separate request of $801,802 for the Women's Court pilot project, detailing staffing costs for a clinical psychologist and social worker, but do not specify the fiscal year(s) for this appropriation.  Further, the exact amounts appropriated for other programs mentioned (e.g., law enforcement in Document 1, elections in Documents 8-10, and 15) are not specified in the provided text.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "Cost projections for the Women's Court pilot program are based on staffing requirements for the existing First Circuit pilot project.  These requirements, detailed in various testimony (e.g., Documents 3 and 4), include 1.0 FTE Clinical Psychologist ($145,000) and 1.0 FTE Social Worker/Human Services Professional IV ($76,788) per circuit.  Additional costs, including training ($5,000-$10,000, Document 1) and technology ($4,900, Document 1), are also included, with total program costs estimated at over $1.5 million for a three-year pilot (Document 7).  However, precise figures for FTEs beyond the psychologist and social worker, and the total budget breakdown across all circuits and years, remain unspecified in the provided documents.",
  "agency_impact": "The Department of Health (DOH) requests funding to expand services and staff support, contingent on the measure not supplanting requests in the Governor's executive budget.  This would necessitate increased operational costs for the DOH, specifically within the Adult Mental Health Division, requiring allocation of resources for additional staffing and service provision.  The exact budgetary impact remains unspecified pending further details on the program's scope and the Governor's budget.",
  "economic_impact": "The proposed Women's Court pilot program, with a requested budget of $801,802 for initial staffing (including a Clinical Psychologist and Social Worker/Human Services Professional IV per circuit), aims to expand mental health and related services.  This expansion is expected to generate community benefits by providing crucial support for participants, potentially reducing recidivism and associated costs in the long term.  However,  the provided documents lack quantitative data on projected cost savings, participation statistics, or broader economic impacts beyond the initial staffing costs.  Further analysis is needed to fully assess the program's overall economic effects.",
  "revenue_sources": "The provided documents indicate that funding for the women's court pilot program will come from the general revenues of the State of Hawaii.  Specific appropriation amounts are not fully detailed in the available text,  with placeholder values like \"$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\" used in several instances. However, Document 7 and Document 8 mention a Department of Health request for $801,802 based on staffing requirements for the existing pilot project in the First Circuit, suggesting this figure may inform the final appropriation.  Further, Document 13 shows an appropriation of $514,900 for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027 for related mental health, substance abuse treatment, and other services and equipment within the program.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "Six-Year Fiscal Implications:  Insufficient data is available to provide a complete six-year fiscal outlook for the Women's Court pilot program.  The provided documents detail appropriations only for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027.  For FY2025-2026,  $514,900 is appropriated, and for FY2026-2027, $557,000 is appropriated (Document 10).  These appropriations include funding for mental health, substance abuse treatment, other services, equipment, and one full-time equivalent (FTE) temporary Kona drug court probation supervisor position (Document 10).  Additionally,  $801,802 is requested to support the First Circuit's existing Women's Court pilot project, encompassing 1.0 FTE Clinical Psychologist ($145,000) and 1.0 FTE Social Worker/Human Services Professional IV ($76,788) positions (Documents 7, 8).  A further $221,788 is requested for the Kona division pilot project (Document 12).  The program is slated to sunset on June 30, 2027 (Document 11).  Without further information regarding potential program extension beyond FY2026-2027,  recurring expenses beyond this period,  and projected workload increases or decreases, a comprehensive six-year projection is impossible.  Assumptions regarding program expansion or permanence are also needed to complete this analysis.  The fiscal note requires additional data to project costs and staffing changes for FY2027-2031.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The provided documents detail a temporary program (HB727), sunsetting on June 30, 2027.  Therefore, there are no ongoing fiscal obligations for the Hawaii state government after six years from the program's July 1, 2025, effective date.  The program's annual operating costs, number of program sites or units, and funding sustainability are all irrelevant after the program's termination.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "This measure is not anticipated to generate any increases in operating revenues for the State of Hawaii.  The documents detail appropriations requests for funding to support the Women's Court pilot program, including staffing and operational costs.  These are expenditures, not revenue-generating activities; therefore, no changes in revenue streams are expected.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The provided documents do not contain information regarding capital expenditures for facilities, equipment, or technology infrastructure related to the Women's Court pilot program (HB727).  The documents primarily focus on personnel costs, specifically requesting funding for FTE clinical psychologist and social worker positions.  Therefore, no capital expenditure impact can be determined from the available information.  Further documentation detailing capital budget allocations or agency plans for this program is required for a complete fiscal note.",
