The candidate text is completely incorrect and appears to be describing a different fiscal measure or pulling from a different source entirely.

- **Contradictory Methodology:** The gold standard states the costs are based on the ""First Circuit Court pilot program,"" while the candidate states they are from the ""Department of Health's proposed budget.""
- **Contradictory Cost Details:** The candidate text provides very specific, but completely different, cost breakdowns (e.g., Clinical Psychologist salary, specific training costs, total appropriations). The gold text mentions supplies, workstations, and contractor costs, none of which are in the candidate text.
- **Missing Critical Information:** The candidate text fails to mention that the cost approximations are being applied to the ""Kona Division,"" a key detail from the gold standard.
- **Incorrect Reference:** The gold standard refers to ""Table 1"" for the cost breakdown, whereas the candidate cites multiple ""Documents.""

The only similarity is the reference to a program in the First Circuit, but all other crucial details are wrong."

The candidate text is completely incorrect and appears to be summarizing information from a different document or a different section of the same document. It shares no factual details with the gold standard text.

- The candidate misses the central economic impact point: the cost of incarceration ($277,035) and the program's goal of reducing these costs.
- The candidate introduces entirely new and unrelated information, such as a funding request of $801,802 and the Department of Health's involvement.
- Critically, the candidate text directly contradicts the gold standard by stating that ""specific performance or participation statistics are not provided,"" when the gold standard is almost entirely composed of such statistics (referrals, participant numbers, graduates)."

The candidate text is completely incorrect and contradicts the gold standard reference.

The primary policy impact described in the gold standard is that the measure makes the First Circuit Women's Court *permanent* and establishes a *new* pilot program in the Third Circuit. The candidate text directly contradicts this by stating ""The program is temporary, sunsetting on June 30, 2027."" It completely misses the core change from a pilot program to a permanent one.

Furthermore, the candidate text fails to mention the new pilot program in the Third Circuit and includes fiscal details (appropriation amounts) that are not present in the gold standard for this field."

The candidate text is completely incorrect and contradicts the gold standard. The gold standard provides a detailed six-year projection based on the assumption of a statewide rollout modeled after the First Circuit's program, including specific cost estimates for pilot and permanent programs ($695,236 and $705,416 respectively). In contrast, the candidate text states that there is insufficient information to create a six-year projection, cites completely different cost figures for a different program (Kona division), and claims information on long-term permanence and expansion is missing, when the gold standard explicitly makes assumptions about these very points to build its forecast."

The candidate text is fundamentally flawed and misses the most important aspects of the gold standard.

- **Critical Omission:** The candidate text completely omits the primary purpose of the measure, which is to **permanently establish the Women's Court Program in the First Circuit**.
- **Factual Contradiction:** The candidate states the Kona pilot program is for three years, directly contradicting the gold standard's statement that it is a **two-year** pilot program.
- **Inaccurate Details:** The purpose of the legislative reports is misrepresented. The gold standard requires reports on the need/cost for courts in Hilo, the Second, and Fifth Circuits, while the candidate describes reports on the Kona program's status and expansion."

The candidate text is highly inaccurate and misleading. While it does contain the correct appropriation figures for the correct fiscal years, it buries this information within a confusing narrative. Critically, it begins by incorrectly stating the sums are ""unspecified"" and ends by incorrectly concluding that the ""exact total appropriations... are not explicitly stated."" These statements directly contradict the gold standard and the primary purpose of an appropriations summary. The inclusion of extraneous details about a different pilot project further confuses the reader."

The candidate text is completely incorrect and appears to be describing a different fiscal analysis. It contradicts the gold standard by focusing on staffing costs (Psychologist, Social Worker) and citing numerous documents, whereas the gold standard's methodology is based on mirroring the ""Mohala Wahine"" program's costs for supplies, technology, and contractors, with a breakdown in ""Table 1"". The candidate text misses every key detail from the reference, including the program name (""Mohala Wahine""), the location (""Kona Division""), the specific cost categories, and the reference to Table 1."

The candidate text is completely incorrect and appears to describe the impact on a different agency (Department of Health) than the one specified in the gold standard (the Judiciary). It does not mention the Judiciary, the Big Island Drug Court, or any of the key details from the reference text. The two texts describe completely unrelated impacts."

The candidate text correctly identifies that a new pilot program is being established in Kona. However, it completely omits the other, more significant policy impact mentioned in the gold standard: making the existing First Circuit Women's Court permanent.

It fails to include any of the specific quantitative data provided in the reference, such as the $277,035 cost of incarceration, the program's goal of 20 participants per year, or the specific numbers for referrals, current participants, and graduates.

Most significantly, the candidate text directly contradicts the gold standard by stating that ""the provided documents lack quantitative data on projected cost savings, participation statistics, or broader economic impacts,"" when the gold standard is composed entirely of this exact information.

The candidate text is completely incorrect and fails to capture any of the key policy impacts described in the gold standard.

The gold standard clearly states the two primary policy changes:
1.  Making the First Circuit Women's Court permanent.
2.  Establishing a new pilot program for the Kona Division of the Third Circuit.

The candidate text misses both of these core points. Instead, it describes fiscal and administrative details (appropriations, temporary positions, Department of Health involvement), which are not mentioned in the gold standard for this field.

- **Inaccuracy:** The reporting requirement is misrepresented. The gold standard specifies reports on the *need and cost* for Hilo, the Second, and Fifth Circuits, whereas the candidate describes reports on *status and expansion recommendations* for ""other circuits"".

The candidate text is completely incorrect and appears to be describing a different aspect of the bill, likely the fiscal or administrative impact, rather than the policy impact. It misses all the critical information from the gold standard, such as:
- Making the First Circuit Women's Court permanent.
- The original pilot program being established by Act 243, SLH 2022.
- The intent to use this as a model for a phased, statewide rollout of Women's Courts.

Instead, the candidate focuses on appropriations, temporary positions, and the role of the Department of Health, none of which are mentioned in the gold standard's description of the policy impact. The two texts have virtually no overlap in content."

However, it includes a significant amount of additional, irrelevant information about specific appropriation amounts. This information about the *amount* of money is out of scope for the `revenue_sources` field and belongs in a field like `appropriations` or `expenditures`. The core information is correct, but the response is noisy and not well-scoped to the question."

- The candidate claims there is insufficient data for a six-year projection, while the gold standard provides a detailed, assumption-based projection for a statewide rollout over six years.
- The candidate cites specific fiscal figures ($514,900, $557,000) that are not mentioned in the gold standard text and directly conflict with the figures provided in the reference ($695,236 pilot cost, $705,416 permanent cost).
- It completely misses the central premise of the gold standard: modeling future pilot programs on the First Circuit's transition from a pilot to a permanent program.
- It fails to mention the planned rollout to the Second, Fifth, and Third Circuits, which is a core component of the gold standard's six-year outlook."
