  "overview": "HB727, HD1 makes the Women's Court pilot program in the First Circuit permanent and establishes a three-year pilot program in the Kona division of the Third Circuit.  The measure appropriates funds for both programs, including staffing for positions such as clinical psychologists and social workers,  and requires the Judiciary to submit reports on the programs' status to the Governor and Legislature by 40 days prior to the convening of the regular sessions of 2026, 2027, and 2028.  The bill includes a sunset clause of June 30, 2027, for at least one temporary position.",
  "policy_impact": "HB727 establishes a three-year Women's Court Pilot Program in Kona, Hawaii,  appropriating $514,900 for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027.  This modifies existing judicial processes by creating temporary positions, including a clinical psychologist and judicial clerks, to provide enhanced services such as medical services, health education, substance abuse treatment, mentoring, and housing support.  The program aims to improve outcomes for women involved in the justice system and is intended to inform future legislation based on a report due in 2026, 2027, and 2028.",
  "appropriations": "Several bills mention appropriations, but precise figures are often absent or presented as \"the sum of $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 or so much thereof as may be necessary.\"  HB 1045, HD1 makes emergency appropriations for fiscal year 2024-2025 to the Department of Accounting and General Services and the Judiciary for law enforcement personnel payroll and fringe benefits; however, the amount is unspecified.  HB 727, HD1 includes an appropriation of $801,802 to the Department of Health, and an unspecified amount for seven temporary positions in the Judiciary, intended for a women's court pilot program, encompassing staffing costs (clinical psychologist, social worker, judicial clerks) across fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027.  Other bills, such as HB 370 and HB 395, reference appropriations for elections and the Judiciary, respectively, but lack specific financial details.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The financial projections for the Women's Court Pilot Program are based on staffing requirements derived from the existing Women\u2019s Court pilot project in the First Circuit (Documents 14, 15, 18, 21).  These requirements, including FTE costs for positions such as Clinical Psychologist, Social Worker, and support staff (Documents 12, 14, 15, 18, 21),  are extrapolated to estimate costs for the Kona division of the Third Circuit (Documents 8, 20, 25).  Additional costs include technology and training (Document 5, 9, 13, 16), with total projected costs for the three-year pilot program exceeding $1.5 million (Document 25).",
  "agency_impact": "The Department of Health (DOH) anticipates that the measure will allow for the expansion of services related to the Women's Court pilot program, specifically requiring additional staff support.  This expansion necessitates an appropriation of $801,802 for fiscal year 2025-2026 and the same amount for 2026-2027,  covering three temporary positions: a clinical psychologist ($145,000), a social worker/human services professional IV ($76,788), and a social services assistant V ($45,216).  The DOH requests that this funding not supplant existing budget requests.",
  "economic_impact": "This measure allocates $514,900 for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027 for the Women's Court Pilot Program in Kona, including mental health and substance abuse treatment services and equipment, and one full-time equivalent temporary probation supervisor position.  The program aims to expand services in areas such as trauma and mental health treatment, family support, life-skills training, and domestic violence prevention,  potentially leading to cost savings in related expenditures through reduced recidivism and improved community well-being.  However,  precise cost savings and participation statistics are not available in the provided documents.",
  "revenue_sources": "The primary funding source for the Women's Court Pilot Program, as detailed in HB727, is the general revenues of the State of Hawaii.  Document 5 and Document 11 specifically state appropriations from general revenues for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027, though the exact amounts are not specified.  These appropriations will cover equipment, mental health and substance abuse treatment services, and the establishment of temporary positions.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The provided documents offer insufficient information to create a complete six-year fiscal outlook for the Women's Court Pilot Program.  The available data focuses primarily on the first two years (FY2025-2026 and FY2026-2027).  Document 6 shows appropriations of $514,900 for FY2025-2026 and $557,000 for FY2026-2027, covering mental health, substance abuse treatment, services, equipment, and one full-time equivalent (FTE) Kona drug court probation supervisor position.  Document 15 mentions a total three-year budget of just over $1.5 million for the Kona Women's Court (KWC) pilot project, implying additional funding beyond the initial two years. However, the exact breakdown for years three, four, five, and six is missing.  Documents 17 and 18 detail Department of Health requests for $801,802, specifying FTE positions (clinical psychologist and social worker) but again, this only covers a portion of the program's costs and lacks a multi-year projection.  The documents also mention the establishment of additional temporary positions (Document 1, Document 7, Document 10, Document 11), but the associated costs for these positions across the six-year period are not provided.  Furthermore, there is no information regarding assumptions about program expansion beyond the initial three-year pilot phase (as mentioned in Document 15) or its potential for permanence after the pilot period concludes.  Recurring expenses beyond salaries and benefits are also unspecified.  To generate a complete six-year fiscal outlook, additional budgetary data and information on the program's long-term goals and sustainability are required.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The provided documents detail a Women's Court Pilot Program with a sunset date of June 30, 2027.  Therefore, there are no ongoing fiscal obligations for the Hawaii state government *after* six years from the program's inception (July 1, 2025).  The program's funding is explicitly temporary, with appropriations specified for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027.  No information is available regarding potential extensions, continued operation, or annual operating costs beyond the initial two-year period.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "This measure is not anticipated to impact State operating revenues.  The proposed program is funded through an appropriation of $514,900 for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027 from the general revenues of the State of Hawaii (Documents 6, 9).  These appropriations represent new expenditures, not changes to existing revenue streams.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The provided documents primarily focus on personnel costs (salaries for clinical psychologists, social workers, and other staff) and program operating expenses (training, program evaluation) associated with the Women's Court pilot program.  Document 7 mentions an appropriation of funds for \"services and equipment,\" but does not specify the nature or cost of the equipment.  Therefore,  detailed information regarding capital expenditures for facilities, technology infrastructure, or other significant equipment investments is insufficient to provide a comprehensive analysis.  Further documentation outlining capital budget allocations for this program is needed.",
