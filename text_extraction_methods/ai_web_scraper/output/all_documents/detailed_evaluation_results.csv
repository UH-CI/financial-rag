The candidate text correctly identifies that the First Circuit program is to be made permanent and that a report is required for other circuits. However, it contains significant factual errors and omissions.

- **Incorrect Information:** It states the new pilot program is for three years, while the gold standard specifies a two-year program.
- **Direct Contradiction:** It claims ""No... sunset clauses are detailed,"" which directly contradicts the gold standard's specific sunset date of June 30, 2027.
- **Missing Information:** It fails to mention the establishment of a temporary position and the appropriation of funds.
- **Extraneous Information:** It includes details about the Department of Health's testimony, which are not present in the gold standard text."

The candidate text is completely incorrect. It appears to be from an entirely different fiscal document. It has the wrong fiscal years, the wrong purpose for the appropriation, and incorrectly states that the specific amounts are not detailed when they are clearly listed in the gold standard.

The candidate text is completely incorrect and contradicts the gold standard reference. The core methodology in the gold standard is explicitly stated as ""mirroring the cost of the First Circuit Court pilot program ('Mohala Wahine')"". The candidate text, in direct opposition, claims that ""No comparable programs or historical budget data are referenced"". Furthermore, the candidate text introduces a host of specific dollar amounts and cost categories (e.g., Peer Specialist, Moral Reconation Therapy) that are not present in the gold standard text.

The candidate text is completely incorrect and contradicts the gold standard. The gold standard provides specific, quantifiable data about the economic impact, including the cost of incarceration ($277,035 per person) and participant numbers, which form the basis for the program's cost-saving potential. The candidate text erroneously claims that ""Specific cost savings... are not quantified"" and that ""Further information is needed,"" which is the exact opposite of what the gold standard text conveys.
