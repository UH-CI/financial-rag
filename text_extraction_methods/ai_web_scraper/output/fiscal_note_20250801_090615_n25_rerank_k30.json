  "policy_impact": "HB727, HD1 establishes a three-year Women's Court Pilot Program in Kona, appropriating $514,900 for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027.  This modifies existing judicial processes by creating a specialized court and  includes funding for a new full-time equivalent temporary Kona drug court probation supervisor position.  The program aims to address the needs of women involved in the justice system, aligning with broader legislative strategies focused on improving mental health, substance abuse treatment, and overall community well-being;  a final report is due to the governor and legislature by 40 days prior to the convening of the regular sessions of 2026, 2027, and 2028.",
  "appropriations": "HB 727 proposes appropriations for a Women's Court pilot program.  Document 13 indicates $514,900 is appropriated for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027.  These funds are intended for mental health, substance abuse treatment, other services, equipment, and one full-time equivalent temporary Kona drug court probation supervisor position within the Kona division of the Third Circuit.  Additional appropriations are mentioned in Documents 11 and 12, but the specific amounts are redacted.  Further, Document 21 suggests an additional $801,802 appropriation to the Department of Health,  broken down in Documents 2 and 3 to include staffing costs for a clinical psychologist ($145,000) and a social worker ($76,788) per circuit.  The total number of circuits and therefore the total cost for these positions is not explicitly stated.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The financial projections for the Women's Court pilot program are based on staffing requirements for the existing First Circuit pilot project,  extrapolated to other circuits.  Cost estimates for positions, such as a Clinical Psychologist ($145,000 FTE) and Social Worker ($76,788 FTE), are derived from departmental budget requests (Documents 3, 4, 17, 22, 24).  Additional costs include training ($5,000 - $47,000, Document 1), technology ($4,900, Document 1), and program evaluation ($10,000, Document 1), with total projected costs varying across documents from $801,802 (Documents 3, 4, 17) to over $1.5 million for a three-year pilot (Document 7).  A lack of detailed breakdown for some cost components limits the precision of the overall projection.",
  "agency_impact": "The Department of Health (DOH) anticipates that the measure will expand services and require additional staff support, contingent upon not supplanting requests in the Governor's executive budget.  This expansion necessitates increased operational costs, including personnel and resource allocation for the Women's Court pilot program.  Specifically, the DOH requests $801,802 in funding,  allocating for positions such as a Clinical Psychologist (1.0 FTE, $145,000) and a Social Worker/Human Services Professional IV (1.0 FTE, $76,788) per circuit.",
  "economic_impact": "The proposed Women's Court pilot program anticipates expanding services and staff support within the Department of Health, contingent upon not supplanting the Governor's executive budget request.  The program, with a requested budget of $801,802 for the initial phase (based on the First Circuit model, requiring one FTE Clinical Psychologist at $145,000 and one FTE Social Worker/Human Services Professional IV at $76,788 per circuit), aims to provide mental health, substance abuse treatment, and other services.  Further economic impacts, including cost savings or reductions in related expenditures, are not specified in the provided documents.",
  "revenue_sources": "The primary funding source for the Women's Court pilot program, as detailed in the provided documents (primarily documents 5, 14, and 22), is the general revenues of the State of Hawaii.  Specific appropriations are requested for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027, with amounts to be determined.  The documents indicate that the funding will support the program's operational costs, including staff salaries (clinical psychologist, social worker, judicial clerks, probation supervisor), technology, training, and program evaluation.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "Six-Year Fiscal Implications:  The provided documents offer incomplete data for a full six-year fiscal projection of the Women's Court Pilot Program.  The legislation (HB727) initially appropriates funds for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027.  Document 10 specifies $514,900 for FY2025-2026 and $557,000 for FY2026-2027 for specific program components in Kona.  Document 7 and 8 detail proposed staffing costs for one circuit: $145,000 for a Clinical Psychologist and $76,788 for a Social Worker/Human Services Professional IV, totaling $221,788.  Document 12 indicates an additional $221,788 is requested for the Kona division.  The program is temporary, sunsetting on 6/30/2027 (Document 11), thus limiting the projection beyond FY2026-2027.  The documents mention the possibility of expansion to other circuits (Document 22), but lack specific cost estimates for such expansion.  Furthermore, recurring expenses beyond the initial two years and assumptions regarding program permanence are not explicitly detailed.  A comprehensive six-year projection requires additional information on potential expansion costs, ongoing operational expenses (beyond personnel costs), and a clear statement on whether the program will seek continued funding beyond its initial sunset date.  Without this information, a complete six-year fiscal outlook cannot be provided.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "Insufficient information is available to comprehensively address the long-term fiscal obligations after June 30, 2027.  The provided documents detail a temporary program (HB727) sunsetting on that date, with appropriations for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027.  No information is provided regarding annual operating costs, program continuation beyond the sunset date, or the existence of any plan for sustaining funding after the initial two-year period.  Therefore, a detailed analysis of fiscal implications after six years cannot be produced.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The provided documents do not contain information on anticipated impacts on operating revenues from the proposed program (Women's Court pilot program).  The documents focus on the program's *expenditures* and requested appropriations, specifying funding amounts for personnel (clinical psychologists, social workers) and other costs (equipment, training, program evaluation) for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027.  No information is given regarding any changes to existing revenue streams or the generation of new revenue sources as a result of this program.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The provided documents detail appropriations for the Women's Court pilot program, focusing primarily on personnel costs (e.g.,  $145,000 for a Clinical Psychologist FTE, $76,788 for a Social Worker FTE).  A total of $1,071,900 is appropriated for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027 for the Kona division pilot program, including funds for mental health, substance abuse treatment, and other services. However,  specific capital expenditures for facilities, equipment, or technology infrastructure are not outlined in these documents.  Further information is needed to determine the extent of any capital investment related to this program.",
