    "overview": "The purpose of this measure is to permanently establish the Women's Court Program in the First Circuit, as well as establish a temporary two-year Women's Court Pilot Program within the Kona division of the Third Circuit. The measure requires reports to the legislature relating to the need and associated costs for a Women's court in the Hilo division of the Third Circuit, as well as the Second and Fifth Circuits. The measure establishes a temporary position, and appropriates funds, with a sunset date of June 30, 2027.",
    "appropriations": "The bill includes and requires an appropriation of $514,900 for FY 2025-2026, and $557,000 for FY 2026-2027 to fund, recruit, and retain full-time mental health professionals, adequate training of program staff, and contract vendors and providers for program operations and technology for the establishment of the two-year Women's Court Pilot Program in the Kona Division of the Third Circuit (\"KWC\").",
    "assumptions_and_methodology": "The approximations for this measure are calculated by mirroring the cost of the First Circuit Court pilot program (\"Mohala Wahine\") and applied to the Kona Division. The KWC program approximations are for supplies, technological devices and workstations, as well as contractor costs, a breakdown of the cost approximations are demonstrated in Table 1.",
    "fiscal_table": "",
    "agency_impact": "The bill, as highlighted through the Senate Committee on Judiciary specifies that the Women's Court Pilot Program is under the supervision of the Big Island Drug Court (\"BIDC\"), specifically the Kona Division. The bill would appropriate funds directly to the Judiciary for the purposes of establishing the pilot program. The Judiciary's Chief Court Administrator, Robert D. S. Kim has set forth the proposed budget with the consultation with the sponsors of the bill.",
    "economic_impact": "The Judiciary has noted that, due to the cost of incarceration of just one individual being $277,035, with the mission and purpose of the Kona Women's Court to keep women out of prison, the program is intended to reduce costs for the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation while enhancing community safety by reducing recidivism. Mohala Wahine has had a goal of accepting twenty women into their program each year and had a total of 83 referrals into the program as of August 2024. In January of 2025, the program had 11 participants in phase one of the treatment, and 12 participants in phase two of the treatment. In June of 2025, the program has graduated 6 of their participants.",
    "policy_impact": "This measure follows Act 243, SLH 2022, which established a three-year Women's Court Pilot Program in the First Circuit, previously set to Sunset on June 30, 2025. The passage of this measure now makes the First Circuit Women's Court permanent and establishes a pilot program for the Kona Division for the Third Circuit. By making the First Circuit Court's Program permanent, the creation of any other pilot programs is intended to serve as a phased rollout for the creation of other Women's Courts throughout the state of Hawaii.",
    "revenue_sources": "Appropriations for this program will come from State General Funds.",
    "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The six-year fiscal implications for this measure will work under the assumption that the Judiciary and Legislature intend to make this a statewide program because the measure as introduced had initially established a Women's Court program within each Circuit Court. If the Women's Court Pilot Program follows the First Circuit Court and becomes permanent, the subsequent Second and Fifth Circuit courts, as well as the Hilo branch of the Third Circuit will also be transitioned through the mechanism of a pilot program into a permanent program as a part of a statewide, phased, rollout program. Under these assumptions, there are slight fiscal implications to the state budget. When the First Circuit Court was first established as a Pilot Program, there was a total of $695,236 appropriated. In making this program permanent, the appropriations for the program have increased with an operating budget of $705,416 appropriated each fiscal year. The program now has eight FTE positions instead of the initial seven temporary positions, with an increase in operating costs of 1.4%. This increase can be attributed to a difference in the start-up costs compared to the recurring costs for program operations; with the statistics from the First Circuit suggesting that costs will likely be higher on a recurring basis. To continue with the pattern of pilot programs to be created in the legislative session prior to the act being repealed, three new pilot programs will occur within the six-year period. Because these programs are to be modeled after the First Circuit Court, the approximations for the six year financial plan will be calculated off of the budget for the First Circuit. The base pilot program in annual appropriation is $695,236. The recurring costs for the program is $705,416. With the predicted pattern of one pilot program created in the legislative session prior to the act being repealed, three new pilot programs will occur within a six-year period, with each predecessor program being made permanent, serving as part of a larger, gradual implementation plan. The timeline for each program can be visualized in Table 2 below, with the programs represented as the following: Program A for the purposes of this table will be: The Second Circuit's Woman's Court. Program B for the purposes of this table will be: The Fifth Circuit's Woman's Court. Program C for the purposes of this table will be: The Third Circuit, Hilo District, Woman's Court",

    "capital_expenditure_impact": "",
    "fiscal_implications_afer_6_years": "After six years, assuming all programs have been funded and made permanent, the remaining fiscal obligations would be solely on the annual operations budget for each program. For these calculations, the assumption remains that the budget for each program will mirror that of the first circuit, so the calculations will be demonstrated as: Base Cost multiplied by number of Court Programs With the values of the base approximated cost and the estimated number of court programs after six years – five, one each in the First Circuit, Second Circuit, Kona division of the Third Circuit, Hilo division of the Third Circuit, and the Fifth Circuit court – the annual fiscal impact following a six year period can be calculated as such: 705,416 * 5 = 3,527,080. As then approximated, the fiscal impact after six years can be calculated annually as $3,527,080 for the permanent Woman's Court programs."
