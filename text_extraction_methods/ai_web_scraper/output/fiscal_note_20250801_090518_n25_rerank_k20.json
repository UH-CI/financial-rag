  "overview": "HB727 establishes a three-year Women's Court Pilot Program in Kona, Third Circuit, appropriating $514,900 for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027.  The program includes the creation of temporary positions, such as a probation supervisor and potentially others (specific numbers and titles for additional positions are not fully detailed in the provided documents),  and will provide services encompassing medical care, health education, substance abuse treatment, mentoring, and housing support.  The program sunsets on June 30, 2027, with a requirement for the Judiciary to submit reports on its status and recommendations for expansion to other circuits by specified dates prior to the 2026, 2027, and 2028 legislative sessions.",
  "policy_impact": "HB727 establishes a temporary Women's Court Pilot Program, creating one full-time equivalent Kona drug court probation supervisor position and appropriating $514,900 for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027.  This modifies existing judicial processes by introducing a specialized court focused on women, potentially aligning with broader legislative strategies aimed at improving mental health, substance abuse treatment, and related services.  The program's sunset provision on June 30, 2027, necessitates a future legislative review of its effectiveness and potential for continuation within the state's judicial system.",
  "appropriations": "HB 727, in its various forms (HD1, CD1), includes appropriations for several programs.  Document 12 requests $801,802 for the Department of Health, and an unspecified amount for seven temporary Judiciary positions.  Document 18 appropriates $514,900 for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027 for the Women's Court Pilot Program, covering mental health services, substance abuse treatment, and equipment, along with one temporary probation supervisor position.  Further appropriations are mentioned for the Judiciary in HB 400 and HB 401 (Documents 14, 15), and for the Office of Elections in HB 370 (Documents 9, 10, 11), but specific amounts are not provided in the given documents.  The intended use of funds varies across the bills, including staffing, services, and equipment.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal projections for this Women's Court Pilot Program are based on staffing requirements derived from the existing Women\u2019s Court pilot project in the First Circuit (Documents 13, 14, 16, 19).  These requirements, detailed in various testimonies (Documents 11, 13, 14, 16, 19), include estimated costs for specific positions such as Clinical Psychologists ($145,000), Social Workers ($76,788), and Social Services Assistants ($45,216) (Documents 11, 13, 14, 16).  Additional costs are projected for training ($5,000 - $10,000), technology ($4,900), and program evaluation ($10,000) (Document 5), resulting in total estimated costs of $514,900 for FY2025-2026 and $557,000 for FY2026-2027 (Document 8).  However,  the documents lack a clear explanation of how these figures were derived beyond referencing existing program costs and proposed staffing levels.",
  "agency_impact": "The Department of Health (DOH) anticipates that the measure will expand services and require additional staff support, contingent upon funding not supplanting existing requests in the Governor's executive budget.  The DOH requests $801,802 to support the Women's Court pilot program, specifically for staffing needs including a Clinical Psychologist (1.0 FTE, $145,000) and a Social Worker/Human Services Professional IV (1.0 FTE, $76,788) per circuit.  This funding request is based on the existing Women's Court pilot project in the First Circuit and would necessitate additional resource allocation for operational needs across multiple circuits.",
  "economic_impact": "This measure is expected to generate positive economic impacts for the State of Hawai'i through the expansion of mental health and substance abuse services.  The appropriation of $514,900 for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027 will fund these services, including the establishment of a full-time equivalent temporary Kona drug court probation supervisor position.  While specific cost savings or reductions in related expenditures are not detailed in the provided documents, the expansion of services is anticipated to benefit the community by improving access to crucial mental health and substance abuse treatment, potentially leading to reduced healthcare costs in the long term.",
  "revenue_sources": "The primary funding source for the program, as indicated in Document 5 and Document 12, is the general revenues of the State of Hawaii.  Specifically, $514,900 is appropriated for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027.  These appropriations are intended to cover mental health, substance abuse treatment, other services, equipment, and the establishment of temporary positions, including a full-time equivalent Kona drug court probation supervisor position (Document 12).  No other revenue streams are explicitly identified in the provided documents.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The provided documents offer insufficient data for a complete six-year fiscal outlook.  The available information focuses primarily on the 2025-2027 biennium for a Women's Court Pilot Program.  Document 5 appropriates $514,900 for FY2025-2026 and $557,000 for FY2026-2027.  Document 14 and 15 detail a Department of Health request for $801,802,  allocating funds for specific positions (1.0 FTE Clinical Psychologist and 1.0 FTE Social Worker/Human Services Professional IV) within the program.  Document 12 mentions an additional $221,788 budget request for the Kona division pilot project.  These figures represent only a portion of the total costs, and the documents do not specify recurring expenses beyond the initial two years.  Furthermore, there is no information regarding program expansion beyond the Kona division or the potential for the program's continuation after FY2026-2027.  No data is available for FY2027-2031.  To create a comprehensive six-year fiscal outlook, additional information is needed on staffing levels beyond the initial positions, projected caseloads,  equipment and operational costs, and assumptions regarding the program's long-term viability and potential expansion to other circuits.  Without this information, a reliable six-year projection cannot be produced.  The current data only allows for a partial two-year projection, with significant gaps in information for a complete six-year analysis.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The provided documents detail funding for the Women's Court Pilot Program through June 30, 2027.  Information regarding ongoing fiscal obligations beyond this date is absent.  Therefore,  annual operating costs after fiscal year 2026-2027, the expected number of program sites or units beyond the pilot program's initial two years, and the long-term sustainability of funding for this program are all unknown and require further legislative specification.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "This measure is not anticipated to have any direct impact on state operating revenues.  The proposed appropriations for mental health services, totaling $514,900 for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027 (as detailed in Document 6), are funded from the general revenues of the State of Hawaii.  There is no indication that the program will generate new revenue streams or reduce existing ones.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The provided documents primarily focus on personnel costs (salaries for clinical psychologists, social workers, and other staff) and program operating expenses (training, technology, and program evaluation) associated with the Women's Court pilot program.  Document 7 mentions an appropriation of funds for \"services and equipment,\" but does not specify the nature or cost of the equipment.  Therefore,  detailed information regarding specific capital expenditures, such as investments in facilities or technology infrastructure, is insufficient to provide a comprehensive analysis of capital expenditure impact.  Further information is needed to quantify any capital expenditure requirements related to this program.",
