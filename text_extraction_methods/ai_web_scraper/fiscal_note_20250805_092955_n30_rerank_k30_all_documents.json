The measure, as amended, includes increased funding for civil legal services and legal services for immigration-related proceedings, reflecting a legislative strategy to address potential impacts of federal policy changes on Hawaii residents.  This appropriation plays a crucial role in ensuring the Judiciary's ability to meet growing demands for its services, impacting state governance by supporting the fair and efficient administration of justice.",
  "appropriations": "HB400 appropriates funds for the Judiciary's operating and capital improvement costs for fiscal biennium 2025-2027.  Operating budget appropriations include $198,782,736 in general funds and $211,628,489 in all means of financing for FY 2025-2026, increasing to $198,855,327 and $211,701,080 respectively in FY 2026-2027.  Capital improvement appropriations include $9,900,000 in general obligation bonds for FY 2025-2026, with no allocation in FY 2026-2027.  Further amendments added $1,750,000 to Administration (JUD601), plus unspecified sums for civil legal services and legal services for immigration-related proceedings.  The intended uses encompass staffing (including 17.0 permanent and 1.0 temporary FTE positions requested), technology upgrades (including cybersecurity), and specific programs like the Criminal Justice Research Institute and expansion of Specialty Courts.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The fiscal projections for HB400, relating to the Judiciary's budget for fiscal biennium 2025-2027, utilize appropriations data from various legislative documents (HB400_HD1, HB400_SD1, HB400_SD2, HB400_CD1)  as the primary data source.  These documents provide varying figures for operating and capital improvement budgets, reflecting amendments throughout the legislative process.  Capital improvement project costs, totaling $12.9 million (as per HB400_CD1), are based on project-specific estimates provided by the Judiciary, with  $7 million allocated as lump sum funding to address unspecified building issues and a shortfall for the Children's Justice Center relocation (estimated to exceed $8 million total cost, based on testimony from the Judiciary).",
  "agency_impact": "HB400 appropriates funds for the Judiciary's operating and capital improvement costs for fiscal biennium 2025-2027.  The proposed budget includes $198,782,736 in general funds for FY 2025-2026 and $198,855,327 for FY 2026-2027,  with additional funding for civil legal services ($1,000,000 per year) and legal services for immigration-related proceedings ($750,000 per year).  This necessitates adjustments to resource allocation within the Judiciary, potentially requiring increased staffing and supervision to manage the expanded programs and increased caseload.",
  "economic_impact": "HB400 appropriates significant funds to the Hawaii State Judiciary for fiscal years 2025-2027.  Operating budget appropriations range from approximately $203 million to $216 million annually, depending on the version of the bill, with additional capital improvement funds of $9.9 million in FY 2025-2026.  While specific cost savings or expenditure reductions are not detailed, the increased funding aims to address growing demands for judicial services, supporting a fair and civil society and potentially reducing backlogs.  The allocation of $1,000,000 annually for civil legal services and $750,000 annually for immigration-related legal services suggests a direct community benefit through improved access to justice.",
  "revenue_sources": "The primary funding source for the Judiciary's budget in fiscal biennium 2025-2027, as detailed in HB400, is General Funds, with appropriations totaling $198,782,736 in FY 2025-2026 and $198,855,327 in FY 2026-2027.  Additionally, General Obligation Bonds contribute $9,900,000 in FY 2025-2026 for capital improvement projects.  The \"All Means of Financing\" figures, encompassing all funding sources, reach $211,628,489 and $211,701,080 for FY 2025-2026 and FY 2026-2027 respectively.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The provided documents offer insufficient data for a complete six-year fiscal outlook.  The available information focuses primarily on the 2025-2027 biennium for the Judiciary's budget.  Document 2 and Document 8 show projected operating expenditures of approximately $211.7 million and $216.2 million respectively for the 2026-2027 fiscal year.  Document 22 indicates an additional request of $6.17 million in FY 2026 and $6.25 million in FY 2027 for operating resources, along with $9.9 million in bond funds for capital improvements in FY 2026.  These figures represent increases of approximately 3% to the Judiciary's operating budget.  The documents also detail staffing changes, including requests for 17.0 permanent and 1.0 temporary FTE positions.  However, no information is provided beyond the 2025-2027 biennium, preventing projection of costs, recurring expenses, and program expansion for the subsequent four years (FY 2027-2031).  Assumptions regarding program permanence are also impossible to make without additional data on long-term funding commitments and legislative intent beyond the initial biennium.  To create a complete six-year fiscal outlook, further information on projected annual growth rates, inflation adjustments, and potential changes in program scope are needed.  The available data only allows for a two-year projection, with significant uncertainties beyond that period.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The provided documents detail funding for the Judiciary through fiscal year 2026-2027, with capital improvement projects' appropriations not lapsing until June 30, 2028.  However,  the documents lack information on annual operating costs, the number of program sites or units, and the funding mechanism beyond fiscal year 2026-2027.  Therefore, a comprehensive analysis of ongoing fiscal obligations after six years is impossible without additional data specifying post-2027 budgetary requirements for the Judiciary's operations and capital improvements.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The provided documents focus on appropriations and budget allocations for the Hawaii Judiciary, not on operating revenue impacts.  Therefore, no information is available to describe anticipated increases, decreases, or changes in revenue streams resulting from the program or measure (HB400).  The fiscal note's operating revenue impact section requires further information regarding revenue generation or impacts on existing revenue sources.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The proposed measure includes $12,900,000 in capital improvement appropriations for the judiciary, allocated across fiscal years 2025-2026 ($12,900,000) and 2026-2027 ($0).  These funds are designated for projects such as the Kauai Judiciary Complex chiller replacement and lump sum capital improvement projects for judiciary facilities statewide.  Funding will be provided through the issuance of general obligation bonds, not exceeding $9,900,000, as authorized in Part V of the Act.",
