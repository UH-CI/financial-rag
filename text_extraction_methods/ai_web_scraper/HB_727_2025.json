and\n(2)\nRequire the Third Circuit of the Judiciary and\nBig Island Drug Court to conduct an interim study to establish a blueprint for\na Women's Court Pilot Program in the Third Circuit.\nYour Committee\nreceived testimony in support of this measure from the Judiciary, Department of\nHealth, Office of the Public Defender, State Council on Mental Health,\nDepartment of the Prosecuting Attorney of the County of Maui, Office of the\nProsecuting Attorney of the County of Hawai\nʻ\ni,\nCounty of Hawai\nʻ\ni\nCommittee on the Status of Women, Hawaii Substance Abuse Coalition, West Hawaii\nBar Association, Community Alliance on Prisons, and nine individuals.\nYour Committee\nfinds that Mohala Wahine, or the State's Women's Court three-year pilot\nprogram, was established in the First Circuit by Act 243, Session Laws of\nHawaii 2022, and has been operational since January 2023.\nThe mission of Mohala Wahine is to assist and\nguide participants in meeting their legal and statutory responsibilities and to\nfacilitate change in the participants' well-being by providing\ngender-responsive services that uphold the mission of the State's Judiciary and\nthe Adult Client Services Branch.\nAdditionally, Mohala Wahine aims to enhance community safety by reducing\nrecidivism through evidence-based, trauma-informed care, and cultural\npractices.\nYour Committee further finds\nthat thus far, the Women's Court Pilot Program has been successful, with eleven\nparticipants in phase one of treatment and twelve participants in phase two of\ntreatment.\nGiven the success of the\nFirst District's Mohala Wahine, your Committee believes that the Mohala Wahine\nPilot Program should become permanent.\nYour Committee\nadditionally finds that the Third Circuit, specifically the Kona area, is at a\ndisadvantage to address crime motivators such as substance abuse, mental\nhealth, and homelessness, given its limited community resources and funding,\ngeographic restrictions, limitations of court supervision authorities,\novercrowded correctional facilities, understaffed law enforcement, and shortage\nof direct service providers.\nAdditionally, Hawaii County has the highest poverty rate in the State,\nhigh rates of domestic violence, and limited opportunities for employment, all\nof which disproportionately impact women, who are more likely to be victims of\nviolence and more likely to have dependent children in their care.\nYour Committee believes that, based on data\nand information provided by the Judiciary in testimony at the public hearing on\nthis measure, closing the service gap for the most at-risk women in the Kona\narea of the Third District is imperative.\nThis measure will support women in the State dealing with trauma, abuse,\nunhealthy relationships, and more by providing substance abuse treatment,\nmental health support, and assistance with navigating the criminal and social\nservices systems.\nAccordingly,\nyour Committee has amended this measure by:\n(1)\nInserting language making the Women's Court\nPilot Program in the First Circuit permanent;\n(2)\nEstablishing a three—year Women's Court Pilot Program\nin the circuit court of the Kona division of the Third Circuit, rather than the\nSecond and Fifth Circuits;\n(3)\nSpecifying that the Women's Court Pilot\nProgram is under the supervision of the Big Island Drug Court;\n(4)\nInserting an appropriation amount of $514,900\nfor fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027 for services\nand two temporary positions for the Women's Court Pilot Program in the Kona\ndivision of the Third Circuit;\n(5)\nDeleting language that would have appropriated\nan unspecified amount of funds to the Department of Health for an unspecified\nnumber of temporary positions;\n(6)\nDeleting language that would have required the\nThird Circuit of the Judiciary and Big Island Drug Court to conduct an interim\nstudy to establish a blueprint for a Women's Court Pilot Program in the Third Circuit;\n(7)\nRequiring the Judiciary to submit a report to\nthe Legislature no later than forty days prior to the Regular Session of 2026\nregarding the need for and the associated costs of a pilot program for Women's\nCourt in the Second and Firth Circuits and Hilo division of the Third Circuit;\n(8)\nAmending section 1 to reflect its amended\npurpose;\n(9)\nInserting an effective date of April 23, 2057,\nto encourage further discussion;

The \n8 \nintent of the program is to implement trauma informed and evidence-based practices, employ \n9 \ngender-responsive programming, collaborate with stakeholders, and provide services to \n10 \nwomen in the court system with the goal of diverting participants from incarceration, \n11 \nsupporting their success in the community, and reducing recidivism. \n12 \nMohala Wahine, which was established in the first circuit by Act 243, SLH 2022, has \n13 \nbeen operational since January 2023. In 2024, through our collaborative partnership with the \n14 \nJudiciary, the Department conducted 33 mental health screenings and 24 psychological \n15 \nassessments of participants for the program. The services offered by the program are \n16 \n\nHB727 \nPage 2 of 2 \n \n \n \ncomprehensive and provide an opportunity for participants to achieve meaningful and lasting \n1 \nrecovery.  \n2 \nOffered Amendments:  The Department requests a budget of $801,802, which is based on the \n3 \nDepartment’s staffing requirements for the operation of the existing Women’s Court pilot \n4 \nproject of the First Circuit.

Kim \nChief Court Administrator \nThird Circuit Court \n \n \nBill No. and Title: House Bill No. 727, Relating to Women’s Court. \n \nPurpose: Establishes a temporary three-year woman's court pilot program within the second, \nthird, and fifth circuits.  Establishes temporary positions.  Requires a report.  Appropriates funds.  \nSunsets 6/30/2028. \n \nJudiciary's Position:  \n \nThe Judiciary supports the intent of this measure and proposes amendments and \nmodifications based on unique circumstances found on the Big Island, and the structure of the \nstate courts in the Third Circuit. \n \nThe Judiciary looks forward to opportunities to build upon the successful Women’s Court \nPilot Program in the First Circuit that this measure represents. To be successful, Women’s Court \nrequires sufficient funding and positions, and a good prospect of recruiting qualified staff for \nthose positions. To be an effective use of resources, Women’s Court also requires a critical mass \nof female probationers who may be eligible for the program. Accordingly, the design of a \nprogram tailored to the unique needs of the population and with robust therapeutic rehabilitative \ncomponents for women will be different on the neighbor islands than it has been on O‘ahu. \n \nThe circuit courts in the Third Circuit are structured very differently than that of the First \nCircuit.  Circuit court judges are responsible for hearing all cases, such as criminal, civil, agency \n\nHouse Bill No. 727, Relating to Women’s Court \nHouse Committee Judiciary and Hawaiian Affairs \n \nThursday, January 30, 2025 \n \nPage 2  \n \n \nappeals, environmental cases and more.  The Big Island Drug Court (BIDC) is stationed in both \nHilo and Kona.  BIDC also oversees the Veteran’s Treatment Court and the Juvenile Treatment \nCourt. \n \nThe circuit courts on the Big Island are unable to manage another stand-alone specialty \ntreatment court as represented by the template of the successful First Circuit program.  However, \ncreating a Women’s Division of the Big Island Drug Court (BIDC) could accomplish the \npurpose. We could design a Women’s Division that incorporates focused rehabilitative mental \nhealth treatment in light of emotional and often physical traumas, includes a cultural component, \nincludes peer support, all in an atmosphere that holds women accountable while providing \ncomprehensive court-supervised treatment, opportunities, and resources. \n \nAccordingly, we respectfully request modifications to this measure to focus on launching \na pilot program in the Third Circuit. Similar to other specialty court programs, circumstances on \nthe neighbor islands may warrant different implementation and different resource requirements.   \n \nOne possible approach would be to pilot a Women’s Division attached to the current \nBIDC program, which currently includes twenty-five (25) women.  By leveraging the existing \nBIDC structure and staff at the outset, it would allow us to supplement the existing services with \nany additional resources provided by this bill.  This option would allow us to tailor to the distinct \nneeds of women in the criminal justice system and expand to include women who are currently \nexcluded from BIDC program participation. \n \nAs an example, we recognize that many women have histories of trauma and abuse, and \none of the hallmarks of the First Circuit Women’s Court Program is their trauma-informed \napproach.   This trauma requires extensive mental health counseling by trained psychologists, \npsychiatrists, and/or mental health counselors.  As such, our current BIDC staff are not equipped \nor sufficiently resourced to address these complex issues.  The addition of resources for a \nWomen’s Division could be used to contract with or hire these trained professionals.  \n \nIf the Legislature is supportive of the proposed approach, we welcome continued \ndiscussions this session, and the Third Circuit and BIDC could provide an outline that would be \nworkable as soon as possible as to put in place a mental health program that would meet the \ndesired goals of a Women’s Treatment Court program. \n  \nIn the alternative, the Legislature could direct the Third Circuit and the BIDC to conduct \nan interim study to establish a blueprint for the program and set forth the resource requirements, \nto be submitted for the next legislative session. The benefit of the study would be a more detailed \nproposal. \n  \n\nHouse Bill No. 727, Relating to Women’s Court \nHouse Committee Judiciary and Hawaiian Affairs \n \nThursday, January 30, 2025 \n \nPage 3  \n \n \nThe Third Circuit and BIDC stand ready to assist the legislature in whatever policy \ndecision is made, as long as we have the requested trained psychologists and psychiatrist on \ncontract or hired by the Judiciary, along with additional staff members to be hired by BIDC. \n \n \nThank you for the opportunity to offer testimony on this important bill. \n\n \n \n \n \nOFFICE OF THE PROSECUTING ATTORNEY \nCounty of Kaua‘i, State of Hawai‘i \n3990 Ka‘ana Street, Suite 210, Līhu‘e, Hawai‘i  96766 \n808-241-1888 ~ FAX 808-241-1758 \nVictim/Witness Program 808-241-1898 or 800-668-5734 \n \n \nAn Equal Opportunity Employer \nRebecca V.

I was moved by seeing how the women \nin Women’s Court supported each other. I appreciate that Women’s Court takes \ninto account the unique issues that women face. We see those unique issues in \nthe cases we prosecute. In addition to histories of abuse and trauma, women \nare often the primary caregivers in their families. It is critical that justice \ninvolved women have the support and tools they need to become productive \nmembers of society. Women’s court also helps stop intergenerational trauma.  \n \nI believe a similar program could be successful in the Fifth Circuit. \nShould such a program be established on Kauai, our Office offers our full \nsupport in making it a success. \n \nThe Kauai Office of the Prosecuting Attorney submits this testimony in \nSUPPORT of HB 727. \n \nThank you for the opportunity to testify. \n\n  RICHARD T.

This bill would \nestablish a three-year women’s court pilot program in the second, third and fifth circuits. \n \n \nThe Department of the Prosecuting Attorney, County of Maui supports this bill because it \nwould provide a needed alternative to incarceration for women within the second circuit, \nparticularly women with a high risk of recidivism and in need of services in addition to the \nsubstance abuse treatment already provided by the Maui Drug Court. We also support the \nprogram’s use of trauma-informed and evidence-based practices. \n \n \nFor these reasons, the Department of the Prosecuting Attorney, County of Maui supports \nH.B. 727.

This testimony is respectfully offered on behalf of the \n3,717 Hawai`i individuals living behind bars1 and under the “care and custody” \nof the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation on January 20, 2025.  We are \nalways mindful that 928 - 29% - of Hawai`i’s imprisoned male population are \nserving their sentences abroad -- thousands of miles away from their loved ones, \ntheir homes and, for the disproportionate number of incarcerated Kanaka Maoli, \nfar, far from their ancestral lands. \n \nCommunity Alliance on Prisons appreciates this opportunity to share our \nstrong support for HB 727 that establishes a temporary 3-year woman's court \npilot program within the second, third, and fifth circuits, establishes temporary \npositions, and requires a report. Appropriates funds.

Women are generally the main \ncaregivers to their families and especially their children. This important program \nuses trauma-informed and evidence-based practices through gender-responsive \nprogramming, collaboration with stakeholders, and providing services to women \nin the court system with the goal of diverting participants from incarceration, \nsupporting their success in the community, and reducing recidivism.  \n \nThis program is vital and we are happy to see this bill expand the \nWomen’s Court Program to women on our neighbor islands in the second, third, \nand fifth circuits. Supporting women and families is a crucial step in building a \nsafe, strong, healthy, and just Hawai`i. \n \nMahalo to the Judiciary for their support of this program and to the JHA \ncommittee for hearing this bill. We look forward to it crossing the finish line, \nespecially after the Chief Justice’s glowing report of the work accomplished by \nthe Women’s Court. \n \nMahalo nui for the chance to cheer on the Women’s Court Project! \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n\n \n \nHB727 Women’s Court \nCOMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY & HAWAIIAN AFFAIRS \nRep. David A. Tarnas, Chair \nRep. Mahina Poepoe, Vice Chair \nThursday, Jan 30, 2025: 2:00: Room 325 Videoconference \n \n \n \nHawaii Substance Abuse Coalition Supports HB727: \n \nALOHA CHAIR, VICE CHAIR, AND DISTINGUISHED COMMITTEE MEMBERS. My \nname is Alan Johnson. I am the current chair of the Hawaii Substance Abuse Coalition \n(HSAC), a statewide organization for substance use disorder and co-occurring mental \nhealth disorder treatment and prevention agencies and recovery-oriented services. \n \n \nHSAC supports a gender responsive approach to women who are justice-involved \nbecause recovery involves a multitude of issues such as trauma, substance use \ndisorder, mental illness, unhealthy relationships, domestic violence, sexual assault, \nand family law disputes. Courts can ensure a collaboration with multiple providers to \nimplement evidenced-based behavioral health practices to support their full recovery \nand not return to incarceration.   \nFormal substance abuse with mental illness treatment, \nsuch as residential and intensive outpatient, is still the \nmost effective approach to achieve functionality and \nlasting recovery for justice-involved women.  \n \nSubstance use disorder coupled with mental health treatment is essential for \noffenders because it addresses the underlying issues that often contribute to criminal \nbehavior and helps break the cycle of addiction and recidivism. Gender-responsive \nwomen’s courts are effective because they address the unique needs and challenges \nwomen face: \n \n1. Trauma-Informed Approach. Women’s courts often adopt trauma-\ninformed practices, ensuring that the court process is sensitive to the \nemotional, psychological, and physical impact of trauma on survivors. This \nfosters an environment where women feel safe, heard, and respected. \n  \n\n2. High Rates of Substance Abuse Among Offenders: Many offenders \nstruggle with substance use disorders. Studies show that a significant \nproportion of crimes, including theft, assault, and drug-related offenses, are \ncommitted under the influence of drugs or alcohol. \n \n3. Addresses Root Causes of Criminal Behavior: Substance abuse often \ncoexists with mental health issues, trauma, or socioeconomic challenges. \nTreatment programs can provide a comprehensive approach to addressing \nthese interconnected factors. Treating substance abuse can lower the \nlikelihood of reoffending. Offenders who receive effective treatment are more \nlikely to develop coping skills and lead crime-free lives after release. \n \n4. Specialized Training for Judges and Staff: Judges, attorneys, and court \nstaff in women’s courts typically receive specialized training in gender \ndynamics, domestic violence, and trauma. This equips them to make \ninformed, fair decisions and avoid perpetuating biases or re-traumatizing \nsurvivors. \n \n5. Integrated Social Services: Women’s courts often partner with social \nservices, offering survivors access to counseling, housing assistance, legal aid, \nchildcare, and job training. This holistic approach addresses the underlying \nissues that women face, helping them rebuild their lives. \n \n6. Empowering Women: By creating a supportive and understanding \nenvironment, women’s courts help survivors regain confidence, independence, \nand control over their lives, encouraging long-term recovery and stability \nwhile simultaneously holding perpetrators accountable while ensuring victim \nsafety. \n \nThis focused approach ensures that justice-involved women are given an opportunity \nto rebuild their lives, contributing positively to society rather than being trapped in \ncycles of crime and incarceration. \n \nWe appreciate the opportunity to provide testimony and are available for questions. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \nLEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS OF HAWAII \nP.O.

Such programs are also fiscally \nresponsible, as supportive services are far less costly than incarceration when a person \nreoffends.  \n \nSB 526 expands the pilot program begun in the first circuit in 2022 to three additional \ndistricts. When women get support dealing with addiction, abuse, and poverty through \nevidence-based programs, education, and training it benefits their children and families, \nneighbors, and the Hawai’i community at large. With this bill the lessons learned in the \nfirst district can be applied to bring successful outcomes to a  larger number of women, \nfor the good of all.  \n \nThank you for the opportunity to submit testimony.  \n\nHB-727 \nSubmitted on: 1/30/2025 12:49:43 AM \nTestimony for JHA on 1/30/2025 2:00:00 PM \nSubmitted By \nOrganization \nTestifier Position \nTestify \nCarrie Ann Shirota \nACLU of Hawai'i  \nSupport \nWritten Testimony \nOnly \n \n \nComments:  \nAloha Chair Tarnas, Vice Chair Poepoe and Committee Members: \nACLU of Hawai'i suppports H.B. 727 Relating to Women's Court that establishes a temporary \nthree-year woman's court pilot program within the second, third and fifth circuits.   \nThis pilot program will contribute to the mandate from the Governor, Legislature and community \nto divert people from our overcrowded jails, by providing the resources, health care, substance \nuse treatment and other holistic support necessary for healing  and transformation.  \nACLU of Hawai'i recommends that criteria for admission into the Women's Court Program is \nexpanded in order to divert more women from our carceral system.

The 3-year pilot program \nestablishes and funds temporary positions, as the 3-year pilot passed by Legislature for Oahu \n(Circuit 1) in 2022 has proven its advantages. \nMahalo for helping our state serve its women in this special way.   \n \n\n \n \n                                                                                   \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJanuary 29, 2025 \n \n \n \nH.B. No. 727: RELATING TO THE WOMEN’S COURT \n \nChair Tarnas, Vice-Chair Poepoe, and Members of the Committee on Judiciary \n& Hawaiian Affairs: \n \n \n \nThe Office of the Public Defender strongly supports HB 727.  This bill establishes  \na three-year women’s court pilot program in the second, third, and fifth circuits.  The \nOffice of the Public Defender regularly represents women in the criminal legal \nsystem and knows first-hand the unique needs and issues facing these clients.  Often \ntheir involvement in the criminal legal system is directly related to trauma, abuse, or \nunhealthy relationships, and they would greatly benefit from gender-responsive \nprogramming.   \n \nThe implementation of the women’s court program in the first circuit, known as \nMohala Wahine, has been thus far successful, with the Office of the Public Defender \nrepresenting most of the participants in the program.   The collaboration with the \ncourt, the prosecutor’s office, probation department, and service providers has \nallowed the women to receive focused services with the support and resources \nnecessary to obtain positive outcomes.  \n \nExpansion to the other circuits would allow the program to assist more women in \nneed and divert them away from incarceration.   \n \nThank you for the opportunity to comment on this measure. \n \n \n \nJON N.

Yamashita, Chair \nRepresentative Jenna Takenouchi, Vice Chair \n \nTuesday, February 25, 2025, 12:00 p.m. \nState Capitol, Conference Room 308 \n \nby \nRobert D. S. Kim \nChief Court Administrator \nThird Circuit Court \n \n \nBill No. and Title: House Bill No. 727, H.D. 1, Relating to the Women’s Court. \n \nPurpose: Establishes a temporary three-year women's court pilot program within the Second \nand Fifth Circuits. Requires the Third Circuit of the Judiciary and Big Island Drug Court to \nconduct an interim study to establish a blueprint for a women's court pilot program in the Third \nCircuit. Requires reports. Establishes temporary positions. Appropriates funds. Effective \n7/1/3000. Sunsets 6/30/2028. (HD1) \n \nJudiciary's Position:  \n \nThe Judiciary supports the intent of this measure to establish a Women’s Court pilot \nproject in the Third Circuit.  However, the Judiciary proposes amendments and modifications to \nthis bill so that the pilot project can be successful in light of the unique structure of the Circuit \nCourts in the Third Circuit and the lack of availability of community-based mental health \nservices on the Big Island. \n \nIn order to successfully implement a Big Island Women’s Court (BIWC) program, this \nbill would need to be modified to: (1) provide for sufficient funding and staff to operate the \nprogram in both the Hilo and Kona courthouses; (2) permit the program to operate as a separate \nprogram under the supervision of Big Island Drug Court (“BIDC”); and (3) establish direct-\nprovider positions and funding for direct services, which are otherwise unavailable on the Big \nIsland.     \n\nHouse Bill No. 727, H.D. 1, Relating to the Women’s Court \nHouse Committee on Finance \n \nTuesday, February 25, 2025 \n \nPage 2  \n \n \n \nThe Circuit Courts in the Third Circuit are structured very differently than those of the \nFirst Circuit.  Due to the large size of Hawaiʻi Island, the Third Circuit has two main courthouses \nhousing Circuit Courts—one in Hilo and one in Kona.  These courthouses are located 100 miles \napart.  The Circuit Courts in the Third Circuit are also dual-docket courts, meaning Circuit Court \njudges are responsible for hearing all case types, including criminal, civil, agency appeals, \nenvironmental cases, and more.  Due to this practical restriction on the courts’ docket and the \ngeography of the island, it has never been practical in the Third Circuit to have stand-alone \nspecialty courts, as has been done successfully in the First Circuit.  Nevertheless, the Third \nCircuit has a history of implementing successful treatment court programs, and the Judiciary now \nlooks forward to the opportunity to build upon this history and establish a successful Women’s \nCourt program on the Big Island. \n  \nOur proposal calls for the establishment of a Women’s Court program to operate in both \nHilo and Kona, and to be supervised by BIDC.  This structure is identical to the other successful \ntreatment court programs currently offered in the Third Circuit.  The drug court program \noperates out of both the Hilo and Kona courthouses to ensure that clients have access to the \nprogram regardless of where they reside on the island.  Due to the success of the BIDC program, \nVeteran’s Treatment Court and Juvenile Treatment Court programs have also been implemented \nin Hilo and Kona.  These programs are not stand-alone courts, but rather operate as separate \ndivisions of BIDC with their own programming, eligibility requirements, and procedures.  The \nproposed BIWC would be the latest addition to these successful specialty court programs. \n \nAccordingly, by situating BIWC under the supervision of BIDC with our other treatment \ncourt programs, the existing BIDC structure and staff can be leveraged at the outset, allowing us \nto supplement existing services with the additional resources to be provided by this bill.  This \nstructure will maximize existing resources and allow the program to focus its efforts on \ndeveloping the programming and services that are at the heart of this pilot project.  Additionally, \nto be an effective use of resources, the Women’s Court program will require a critical mass of \nfemale probationers who may be eligible for the program.  The highest-risk justice-involved \nwomen in the Third Circuit are already participating in the BIDC program.  Thus, our proposal \ncalls for all twenty-five (25) of the women currently participating in the BIDC program to be \nscreened for eligibility for the BIWC program.  This will allow the program to begin providing \nservices to the target population immediately, instead of waiting for individual referrals to trickle \nin for a standalone program.    \n \nTo be successful, the BIWC will require sufficient funding and positions, and a good \nprospect of recruiting qualified staff for those positions.  The Judiciary’s proposal contemplates a \ntrauma-informed and gender-responsive program tailored to the unique needs of high-risk \nwomen, with robust mental health, therapeutic, and rehabilitative components.  The proposal also \ncalls for a cultural competency component and staff in peer support roles, with all programing to \n\nHouse Bill No. 727, H.D. 1, Relating to the Women’s Court \nHouse Committee on Finance \n \nTuesday, February 25, 2025 \n \nPage 3  \n \n \nbe provided in an atmosphere that holds women accountable while providing court-supervised \ntreatment, opportunities, and resources.  \n \nA truly trauma-informed approach to this program will require extensive mental health \ncounseling by trained psychologists, psychiatrists, and/or mental health counselors.  These \nmental health services are severely deficient on Hawaiʻi Island, where a lack of community-\nbased mental health providers often proves to be an insurmountable barrier to treatment.  \nMoreover, our current BIDC staff are not equipped or sufficiently resourced to address these \ncomplex issues without comprehensive training.  Thus, our proposal for a BIWC has a strong \nfocus on the development of mental health services, with the hiring of full-time equivalent \nproviders, funding for the creation of new services, and training for program staff. \n \nSimilar to other specialty court programs, a one-size-fits-all approach is not always best.  \nCircumstances on the neighbor islands may warrant different implementation and different \nresource requirements.  Accordingly, we respectfully request modifications to this measure that \nwill allow the Judiciary’s BIWC proposal to be put into action. \n \nIf the Legislature is supportive of the Judiciary’s proposal for a BIWC program, we \nwelcome continued discussions during this session.  In the alternative, the Legislature could \ndirect the Third Circuit and the BIDC to conduct an interim study to establish an updated \nproposal for the program, setting forth additional information regarding the resource \nrequirements for the program, to be submitted for the next legislative session.  However, as the \nlargest challenges facing the implementation of a Women’s Court program in the Third Circuit is \nthe lack of community-based providers, a study may be of little benefit.  \n  \nThe Third Circuit and BIDC stand ready to assist the legislature in whatever policy \ndecision is made, as long as we have the requested mental health professionals on contract or \nhired by the Judiciary, along with additional staff members to be hired by BIDC. \n \nIn addition, given the Third Circuit’s willingness to pilot this modified Women’s Court \nmodel, we would respectfully request that the Second and Fifth Circuits be deleted from \nconsideration for this pilot project.   \n \n \nThank you for the opportunity to offer testimony on this important bill. \n\n \n \n                                                                                   \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFebruary 24, 2025 \n \n \n \nH.B. No. 727, HD1: RELATING TO THE WOMEN’S COURT \n \nChair Yamashita, Vice-Chair Takenouchi, and Members of the Committee: \n \n \nThe Office of the Public Defender supports HB 727, HD1.  This bill establishes a \nthree-year women’s court pilot program in the second and fifth circuits and requires \nthe third circuit to conduct an interim study to establish a blueprint for a women’s \ncourt pilot program.  The Office of the Public Defender represents countless women \nin the criminal legal system and knows first-hand the unique needs and issues facing \nthese clients.  Often their involvement in the criminal legal system is directly related \nto trauma, abuse, or unhealthy relationships, and they would greatly benefit from \ngender-responsive programming.   \n \nThe implementation of the women’s court program in the first circuit, known as \nMohala Wahine, has been thus far successful, with the Office of the Public Defender \nrepresenting most of the participants in the program.   The collaboration with the \ncourt, the prosecutor’s office, probation department, and service providers has \nallowed the women to receive focused services with the support and resources \nnecessary to obtain positive outcomes.  \n \nExpansion to the other circuits would allow the program to assist more women in \nneed and divert them away from incarceration.  We are mindful of the additional \nresources implementation of such programs will require and are supportive of any \nappropriations as deemed necessary.   \n \nThank you for the opportunity to comment on this measure. \n \n \n \nJON N.

The measure \n8 \nalso requires the third circuit of the Judiciary and Big Island Drug Court to conduct an interim \n9 \nstudy to establish a blueprint for a women's court pilot program in the third circuit. The intent \n10 \nof the project is to implement trauma informed and evidence-based practices, employ gender-\n11 \nresponsive programming, collaborate with stakeholders, and provide services to women in the \n12 \ncourt system with the goal of diverting participants from incarceration, supporting their success \n13 \nin the community, and reducing recidivism. \n14 \n LATE *Testimony submitted late may not be considered by the Committee for decision making purposes. \n\nHB727 HD1 \nPage 2 of 2 \n \n \n \nMohala Wahine, which was established in the first circuit by Act 243, SLH 2022, has \n1 \nbeen operational since January 2023. In 2024, through our collaborative partnership with the \n2 \nJudiciary, the Department conducted 33 mental health screenings and 24 psychological \n3 \nassessments of participants for the program.

Kyle T. Yamashita, Chair \nRep. Jenna Takenouchi, Vice Chair \nTuesday, Feb 25, 2025: 12:00: Room 308 Videoconference \n \n \n \nHawaii Substance Abuse Coalition Supports HB727 HD1: \n \nALOHA CHAIR, VICE CHAIR, AND DISTINGUISHED COMMITTEE MEMBERS. My \nname is Alan Johnson. I am the current chair of the Hawaii Substance Abuse Coalition \n(HSAC), a statewide organization for substance use disorder and co-occurring mental \nhealth disorder treatment and prevention agencies and recovery-oriented services. \n \n \nHSAC supports a 3 year pilot program and interim study for a gender responsive \napproach to women who are justice-involved. \n \nRecovery can be complex because recovery involves a multitude of issues such as \ntrauma, substance use disorder, mental illness, unhealthy relationships, domestic \nviolence, sexual assault, and family law disputes. Courts can ensure a collaboration \nwith multiple providers to implement evidenced-based behavioral health practices to \nsupport their full recovery and not return to incarceration.   \nFormal substance abuse with mental illness treatment, \nsuch as residential and intensive outpatient, is still the \nmost effective approach to achieve functionality and \nlasting recovery for justice-involved women.  \n \nSubstance use disorder coupled with mental health treatment is essential for \noffenders because it addresses the underlying issues that often contribute to criminal \nbehavior and helps break the cycle of addiction and recidivism. Gender-responsive \nwomen’s courts are effective because they address the unique needs and challenges \nwomen face: \n \n1. Trauma-Informed Approach. Women’s courts often adopt trauma-\ninformed practices, ensuring that the court process is sensitive to the \nemotional, psychological, and physical impact of trauma on survivors. This \nfosters an environment where women feel safe, heard, and respected. \n\n  \n2. High Rates of Substance Abuse Among Offenders: Many offenders \nstruggle with substance use disorders. Studies show that a significant \nproportion of crimes, including theft, assault, and drug-related offenses, are \ncommitted under the influence of drugs or alcohol. \n \n3. Addresses Root Causes of Criminal Behavior: Substance abuse often \ncoexists with mental health issues, trauma, or socioeconomic challenges. \nTreatment programs can provide a comprehensive approach to addressing \nthese interconnected factors. Treating substance abuse can lower the \nlikelihood of reoffending. Offenders who receive effective treatment are more \nlikely to develop coping skills and lead crime-free lives after release. \n \n4. Specialized Training for Judges and Staff: Judges, attorneys, and court \nstaff in women’s courts typically receive specialized training in gender \ndynamics, domestic violence, and trauma. This equips them to make \ninformed, fair decisions and avoid perpetuating biases or re-traumatizing \nsurvivors. \n \n5. Integrated Social Services: Women’s courts often partner with social \nservices, offering survivors access to counseling, housing assistance, legal aid, \nchildcare, and job training. This holistic approach addresses the underlying \nissues that women face, helping them rebuild their lives. \n \n6. Empowering Women: By creating a supportive and understanding \nenvironment, women’s courts help survivors regain confidence, independence, \nand control over their lives, encouraging long-term recovery and stability \nwhile simultaneously holding perpetrators accountable while ensuring victim \nsafety. \n \nThis focused approach ensures that justice-involved women are given an opportunity \nto rebuild their lives, contributing positively to society rather than being trapped in \ncycles of crime and incarceration. \n \nWe appreciate the opportunity to provide testimony and are available for questions. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCOMMUNITY ALLIANCE ON PRISONS \nP.O.

This testimony is respectfully offered on behalf of the \n3,700 Hawai`i individuals living behind bars1 and under the “care and custody” \nof the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation as of February 17. 2025.  We \nare always mindful that 936 – 49.6% of Hawai`i’s male prison population are \nserving their sentences abroad -- thousands of miles away from their loved ones, \ntheir homes and, for the disproportionate number of incarcerated Kanaka Maoli, \nfar, far from their ancestral lands. \n \nCommunity Alliance on Prisons appreciates the opportunity to strongly \nsupport HB 727 HD1 establishes a temporary three-year women's court pilot \nprogram within the Second and Fifth Circuits. Requires the Third Circuit of the \nJudiciary and Big Island Drug Court to conduct an interim study to establish a \nblueprint for a women's court pilot program in the Third Circuit. Requires reports. \nEstablishes temporary positions and funding. \n \n \n1 DCR Weekly Population Report, February 17, 2025 \nhttps://dcr.hawaii.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pop-Reports-Weekly-2025-02-17.pdf \n \n\nWe are so happy that Judge Kim from Hawai`i Island participated in the \nhearings on this proposal and educated the committees and policymakers on the \nneeds of our neighbor islands. We know that Hawai`i does not have all the services \nneeded to address the issues facing some of our most vulnerable people, especially \nthose living on neighbor islands, who have fewer resources than O`ahu. \n \nThe prior committee discussions has empowered the Third Circuit to \nconduct an interim study to develop a blueprint for the establishment of a \nWomen’s Court program there. This is a great start for a program praised by Chief \nJustice Recktenwald in his 2025 State of the Judiciary speech. \n \nCommunity Alliance on Prisons hopes that the committee sees the value in \nimproving the quality of justice in Hawai`i nei. \n \nMahalo nui! \n \n \n\nHB-727-HD-1 \nSubmitted on: 2/21/2025 10:26:53 PM \nTestimony for FIN on 2/25/2025 12:00:00 PM \nSubmitted By \nOrganization \nTestifier Position \nTestify \nJackson Roy Harrington \nIndividual \nSupport \nWritten Testimony \nOnly \n \n \nComments:  \nTestimony in Support of HB727 HD1 \nDear Chair and Members of the Committee, \nI am writing in strong support of HB727.

I am writing in support of HB 727, relating to the \nimportance of a Women’s Court, here on the island of Hawai’i. \n \nI am originally from the island of Kaua’I and moved to Hawaii island in 2002. I am the \noldest of 3 and as such the burden of taking care of my younger siblings fell to me at a \nyoung age. Having to “grow up” at a young age, I got caught up with experimentation during \nmiddle & high school.  \n \nFor most of my adult life I used off and on, until I couldn’t. I found myself being \narrested and having to navigate my way through the judicial system. I attempted to comply \nwith regular probationary rules but found I just couldn’t stay clean. During a revocation that \nhad me spend 30 days in jail, I heard about Drug Court. Of course, it was “don’t do it,” \n“you’ll never be able to get out of it,” and so on.  \n \nI was ready to be done and move on with my life so when my probation officer \nbrought up Drug Court, I jumped at the chance. I needed someone to hold me accountable \nand keep me on the right track. I graduated in May 2023 and have been able to remain \nclean. Drug Court helps to get you the tools you need to lead an honest & productive life. \nSince then, I have worked in a treatment center and currently work in the mental health \nfield.  \n \nHB 727 is important to bring awareness to individual needs and how to lower \nrecidivism. Women are hard wired to take on others’ problems, stress, feelings, you name \nit, we want to fix it for you. With that mentality, anyone would crack. Women require more \nsupport whether we know it or not. By creating a Women’s court, it would reduce the \nnumber of women in jail, keeping families together. Having Women’s Mental & Behavioral \nHealth available to help with SUD and mental health issues will help destigmatize getting \nhelp. There’s nothing wrong with needing help, having it available would make it easier to \nget. It would create a safe place to find help. \n \nThere is nothing better than being able to talk with someone you know has come \nfrom similar situations as you and made it through the dark tunnel, back into the sun. Peer \nsupport and getting back to your roots are by far some of the best therapy there can be. \nSomeone who can help you through those dark times by showing you the way. Recentering \nand getting back into cultural practices with a knowledgeable teacher can do more for \nmind, body, & spirit. For both women and men! \n \nPlease support HB 727, relating to Women’s Court. \n \nMahalo, \nGenesis L E Kepo’o \n\nHB-727-HD-1 \nSubmitted on: 2/24/2025 11:31:04 AM \nTestimony for FIN on 2/25/2025 12:00:00 PM \nSubmitted By \nOrganization \nTestifier Position \nTestify \nShelbie  \nIndividual \nSupport \nWritten Testimony \nOnly \n \n \nComments:  \nAloha and good afternoon. \n   My name is Shelbie Keka. I am writing a testimony in support of HB727. Relating to a \nwomen’s court, on the big island. \nGrowing up I was raised with 3 older brothers and with both parents that battled with the disease \nof addiction. My father was addicted to meth and my mother addicted to meth/herion. My \nbrothers and I never had a stable home but by the grace of god my aunty who was a single \nmother opened her home to us. We resided with her for about 5 years until my dad had called \nand wanted us back because he was clean.  \n   My mother left to Oahu during that time to regain control of her life again and entered \ntreatment there. Unfortunately the addiction is so strong that it ripped my dad away from us for \nthe second time but it also took my two brothers as well. Having no adult supervision or family \nto take us in again my brother and I  were forced to move to Oahu to live with my mom, who at \nthe time had just graduated treatment and had her own place. We were there for about a year and \na half before my brother decided to leave and go back to the big island.  \n   I was unhappy and began to go downhill with my life, I ditched school causing me to repeat the \n9th and 10th grade then I began to drink pop pills and smoke weed. My relationship with my \nmom at the time became rocky and she kicked me out. I was able to return to the big island and \nstay with my active using dad. When I returned home I started cruising the streets on Ali drive. I \nmet the wrong crowd and decided to take my first hit with them. I was only 17 years old.I battled \nthe disease of addiction for the next 4-5 years. A few months into smoking meth I began to steal \nfrom innocent people or even from my family. I sold drugs, stole people cars and mopeds. Lied \nand cheated. Even after being incarcerated many times, I came back out to the streets and did it \nall again!  \n   No one really understands until you’ve actually been there. Being homeless for so long and an \nactive user in the streets, I’ve seen so many things. It’s not easy for women to be  out there, I’ve \nseen many women get abused verbally physically and mentally. I’ve seen them get taken \nadvantage of as well as manipulated into doing things that they would have not done before. \nWhen I had my last arrest I was in regular probation and knew I wouldn’t get out for a while.  \n  Being incarcerated I had time to gain clarity on my life, I knew that I wanted better and to do \nbetter. I called my lawyer to submit an application to big island drug court. A few weeks go by \nand I got approved , I was released my very next court hearing. I met with my new po as well as \nmy old one and the deal was I had to go to Hilo BISAC the next day.  \n   Because I was blessed with that opportunity I graduated treatment. I came back to Kona got a \njob, got my license and my very first legal car. Then I moved out to our very first house with my \nsignificant other who is also a graduate of big island drug court. I obtained my GED and lastly, I \n\nsuccessfully completed the drug court program. All these things were possible because of the \nstaff that runs these programs and the rules that are placed to keep us sober. \n    That’s why this proposal is very important to me because not only does it come from people \nwho care about the suffering addicts but because it works! After graduation I still continued to \nstrive now I am a home owner and a co owner to a cleaning business. So it shows that it’s also a \nlong term success for the recovering addict. This program should be in high demand because \nwomen don’t have much, BISAC treatment only had one house for 8 girls and two houses for the \nmen  for double occupancy! Women also value their mental health and being on drugs damages \nthat for us. We loose who we are and who we are meant to become, it breaks us to the point \nwhere we loose value for life. That’s why this program should pass because we need to help our \nnative people to become positive members of society, to allow the kids to have their parents \npresent in their lives and to break these generational curses.  \n   I know this program will have the power to do all of that and save our native people! These \nwomen and men need our help, YOUR help. If not this vicious cycle will continue to degrade \nour culture and our people. So I ask to please support HB727 relating to women’s court just as I \ndo. Mahalo for your time.  \n  \n \n\n           In Support of HB 727 \n \n \n \n \n \nAloha Commitee, \n \nI am Jessicamae Caravalho, LSW and I am honored to submit this testimony in strong support of \nthe establishment of a Women’s Court in the Second and Fifth Circuits, which will provide a \nspecialized judicial process to address issues unique to women. \n \nAs a Big Island Drug Court graduate, I am familiar with the benefits of specialized courts. Drug \ncourts provide tailored interventions, and I have experienced how these courts create pathways to \nrehabilitation and recovery. Today, I am beyond grateful to hold a Master in Social Work degree \n– soon to sit for clinical examination, while being of service to my community. Similarly, a \nWomen’s Court would offer targeted solutions for gender-specific issues, ensuring that women \nreceive fair and equitable treatment within the justice system. \n \nHB 727 proposes to offer a safe space for women, ensuring that they are heard without bias or \nfear of intimidation. The legal process can be daunting, and many women hesitate to seek \nassistance due to societal pressures, stigma, or lack of proper legal support. Research indicates \nthat women’s involvement in criminal behavior is often influenced by histories of abuse, trauma, \npoverty, mental illness, substance use disorders, and unhealthy relationships. Traditional legal \nstructures often fail to adequately address complex trauma. A dedicated Women’s Court would \nensure that such cases receive the specialized attention they require, with trained staff who \nunderstand the nuances of gender-based issues.  \nHB 727 seeks to implement trauma-informed practices, offering legal, psychological, and social \nservices in a coordinated manner. These services include trauma and mental health treatment; \nfamily support, including parenting, education, and relationship improvement; life-skills training; \neducation and vocational training; domestic violence prevention; medical services and health \neducation; substance abuse detection, prevention, and treatment, mentoring and housing support. \nWomen’s Court is specifically designed to cater to complex needs by bridging the gap in the \njustice system and ensuring that women receive equitable treatment. \nI, respectfully, ask that you stand in support of this measure. \nMahalo, \nJessicamae Caravalho, LSW \nJessicamae Caravalho, LSW \n \n\nHB-727-HD-1 \nSubmitted on: 2/24/2025 1:47:25 PM \nTestimony for FIN on 2/25/2025 12:00:00 PM \nSubmitted By \nOrganization \nTestifier Position \nTestify \nFrank Schultz \nIndividual \nOppose \nWritten Testimony \nOnly \n \n \nComments:  \nLittle to no info on what is the purpose of this women's court. \n \n LATE *Testimony submitted late may not be considered by the Committee for decision making purposes. \n"

S. Kim \nChief Court Administrator \nThird Circuit Court \n \n \nBill No. and Title: House Bill No. 727, H.D. 1, Relating to the Women’s Court. \n \nPurpose: Establishes a temporary three-year women's court pilot program within the Second \nand Fifth Circuits. Requires the Third Circuit of the Judiciary and Big Island Drug Court to \nconduct an interim study to establish a blueprint for a women's court pilot program in the Third \nCircuit. Requires reports. Establishes temporary positions. Appropriates funds. Effective \n7/1/3000. Sunsets 6/30/2028. (HD1) \n \nThird Circuit's Position:  \n \nThe Third Circuit supports the intent of this measure to expand the women’s court pilot \nproject.  However, the Third Circuit proposes amendments and modifications to this bill so that \nthe pilot project can be implemented in the Third Circuit and can be successful in light of the \nlack of availability of community-based mental health services on the neighbor islands. \n \nThe Third Circuit respectfully requests the bill to be amended to reflect a two-year \nprogram for the Big Island.  Attached to this testimony is a detailed proposal for the \nestablishment of a two-year Women’s Court pilot project in the Kona Division of the Third \nCircuit Court.  In order to successfully implement this Kona Women’s Court (“KWC”) program, \nthis bill would need to be modified to: (1) establish a two-year women’s court pilot project in the \nCircuit Court of the Third Circuit; (2) provide for sufficient funding and staff to operate the \nprogram in Kona for the duration of the two-year pilot project; (3) permit the program to operate \n\nHouse Bill No. 727, H.D. 1, Relating to the Women’s Court \nSenate Committee on Judiciary \n \nWednesday, March 19, 2025 \n \nPage 2  \n \n \nas a separate program under the supervision of Big Island Drug Court (“BIDC”); (4) establish \ndirect-provider positions and funding for direct services, which are otherwise unavailable on the \nBig Island; and (5) delete the provisions of the bill requiring the Second and Fifth Circuits to \nestablish a three-year women’s court pilot project.     \n \nThe Circuit Courts in the Third Circuit are structured very differently than those of the \nFirst Circuit.  Due to the large size of Hawaiʻi Island, the Third Circuit has two main courthouses \nhousing Circuit Courts—one in Hilo and one in Kona.  These courthouses are located 100 miles \napart.  The Circuit Courts in the Third Circuit are also dual-docket courts, meaning Circuit Court \njudges are responsible for hearing all case types, including criminal, civil, agency appeals, \nenvironmental cases, and more.  Due to these practical restrictions on the courts’ calendar and \nthe geography of the island, it has never been practical in the Third Circuit to have standalone \nspecialty courts, as has been done successfully in the First Circuit.  Nevertheless, the Third \nCircuit has a history of implementing successful treatment court programs, and the Judiciary now \nlooks forward to the opportunity to build upon this history and establish a successful women’s \ncourt program in Kona. \n  \nOur proposal calls for the KWC program to be supervised by the Kona Division of BIDC.  \nThis administrative structure is similar to the other successful treatment court programs currently \noffered in the Third Circuit.  Due to the success of the BIDC program, Veterans’ Treatment \nCourt and Juvenile Treatment Court programs have also been implemented in the Third Circuit.  \nThese programs are not standalone courts, but rather operate as separate divisions of BIDC with \ntheir own programming, eligibility requirements, and procedures.  The proposed KWC program \nwould be the latest addition to these successful specialty court programs. \n \nAccordingly, by situating KWC under the supervision of BIDC with our other treatment \ncourt programs, the existing BIDC structure and staff can be leveraged at the outset of the \nprogram, allowing us to supplement existing services with the additional resources to be \nprovided by this bill.  This structure will maximize existing resources and allow the program to \nfocus its efforts on developing the programming and services that are at the heart of this pilot \nproject.  Additionally, to be an effective use of resources, the KWC program will require a \ncritical mass of female probationers in West Hawaiʻi who may be eligible for the program.  The \nhighest-risk justice-involved women in the Third Circuit (“Priority 1 participants”) are already \nparticipating in the BIDC program.  Thus, our proposal calls for all fourteen (14) of the women \ncurrently participating in the Kona BIDC program to be screened for eligibility for the KWC \nprogram.  During the course of the proposed two (2) year program, BIDC has approximately \nthirty (30) women designated as Priority 2 participants, which can be assessed for inclusion into \nthe KWC program.  This will allow the program to begin providing services to the target \npopulation immediately, instead of waiting for individual referrals to trickle in for a standalone \nprogram.  If the pilot program is successful, the ultimate goal would be to expand the women’s \ncourt program to Hilo and make the program permanent after the end of the 2-year project \nperiod.    \n\nHouse Bill No. 727, H.D. 1, Relating to the Women’s Court \nSenate Committee on Judiciary \n \nWednesday, March 19, 2025 \n \nPage 3  \n \n \n \nTo be successful, the BIWC will require sufficient funding and positions, and a good \nprospect of recruiting qualified staff for those positions.  The Judiciary’s proposal contemplates a \ntrauma-informed and gender-responsive program tailored to the unique needs of high-risk \nwomen, with robust mental health, therapeutic, and rehabilitative components.  The proposal also \ncalls for a cultural competency component and staff in peer support roles, with all programing to \nbe provided in an atmosphere that holds women accountable while providing court-supervised \ntreatment, opportunities, and resources.  \n \nA truly trauma-informed approach to this program will require extensive mental health \ncounseling by trained psychologists, psychiatrists, and/or mental health counselors.  These \nmental health services are severely deficient on Hawaiʻi Island, where a lack of community-\nbased mental health providers often proves to be an insurmountable barrier to treatment.  \nMoreover, our current BIDC staff are not equipped or sufficiently resourced to address these \ncomplex issues without comprehensive training.  Thus, our proposal for a KWC has a strong \nfocus on the development of mental health services, with the hiring of full-time equivalent \nproviders, funding for the creation of new services, and training for program staff. \n \nSimilar to other specialty court programs, a one-size-fits-all approach is not always best.  \nCircumstances on the neighbor islands may warrant different implementation and different \nresource requirements.  Accordingly, we respectfully request modifications to this measure that \nwill allow the attached KWC proposal to be put into action. \n \nThe Judiciary has consulted with the sponsors of this bill—Representative Linda \nIchiyama and Representative Mahina Poepoe—in the development of the attached proposal.  If \nthe Legislature is supportive of this proposal, we welcome continued discussions during this \nsession.  \n \nThe Third Circuit and BIDC stand ready to assist the legislature in whatever policy \ndecision is made, as long as we have the requested mental health professionals on contract or \nhired by the Judiciary, along with additional staff members to be hired by BIDC. \n \nIn addition, given the Third Circuit’s willingness to pilot this modified Women’s Court \nmodel, we would respectfully request that the Second and Fifth Circuits be deleted from \nconsideration for this pilot project, at this time.  \n \n \nThank you for the opportunity to offer testimony on this important bill.\n\n \n \n \n1 \n \n2025 Legislative Session                                                         Kona Women’s Court Proposal – Third Circuit \nKONA WOMEN’S COURT:  \nA Proposal for a Women’s Justice and Treatment Program in West Hawaiʻi \nPilot Program: 2 Years \n \n \nI. \nSUMMARY \nThis proposal for the formation of a Kona Women’s Court (“KWC”) program as a \n2-year pilot project. The effective implementation of this proposal would require \namendments to the current bills that would permit the Third Circuit to implement its \nWomen’s Court program under the umbrella of the well-established Big Island Drug Court \n(“BIDC”). By developing KWC under the pre-existing drug court program, the KWC pilot \nproject will use the established structures of drug court as its “backbone”, thereby \nenabling the development of a successful program, notwithstanding the practical \nlimitations of the Third Circuit’s dual-docket courts. Positioning the KWC program under \nthe supervision of drug court will also guarantee the most effective use of resources and \nmaximum benefit to the target population of women that the Women’s Court model aims \nto serve. The KWC program requires a critical mass of women participants, and all of the \nfourteen (14) women already participating in Kona BIDC are at high risk for recidivism, \nhave high rates of substance abuse, and have high mental health needs. This proposal \ntherefore envisions KWC as a division of Kona drug court with distinct eligibility \nrequirements, gender-responsive programming, and mental health services and \ntreatment options that are specially designed to address the needs of justice-involved \nwomen in Hawaiʻi Island’s rural community.  \nII. \nPURPOSE \nA. Due to Resource Requirements and the Structure of the Circuit Courts in the \nThird Circuit, There Is a Need to Develop the Women’s Court Program under \nthe Auspices of Big Island Drug Court. \nThe Circuit Courts of the Third Circuit are structured very differently from those in \nthe First Circuit. There are only four (4) Circuit Court judges in the Third Circuit, and all of \nthem, including the two (2) judges assigned to drug court, are responsible for hearing all \ncase types, including all criminal and civil cases, agency appeals, environmental court \ncases, special proceedings, and more. Moreover, due to Hawaiʻi Island’s size, the Third \nCircuit is the only circuit with two courthouses housing Circuit Courts. These courthouses \nare situated nearly 100 miles apart, and each courthouse services distinct geographic \nareas of the island—the Hilo Circuit Court hears cases from East Hawaiʻi, including the \ndistricts of North and South Hilo, Puna, and Hāmākua, and the Kona Circuit Court hears \ncases from West Hawaiʻi, including the districts of North and South Kona, North and South \nKohala, and Kaʻū.  \nBecause of the Circuit Court’s dual-docket calendars and the geography of the \nisland, it has never been feasible in the Third Circuit to have single, standalone specialty \ncourts dedicated exclusively to the treatment court model, as has been done successfully \nin the First Circuit.  Nevertheless, the Third Circuit has a long history of the successful \n\n \n \n \n2 \n \n2025 Legislative Session                                                         Kona Women’s Court Proposal – Third Circuit \nimplementation of the treatment court model in spite of these limitations, beginning with \nthe BIDC program. \nBig Island Drug Court is a specialty treatment court first established in the Third \nCircuit over twenty (20) years ago, in 2002. The BIDC program is dedicated to reducing \nrecidivism and supporting individuals with substance use disorders and co-occurring \nmental health issues, through a structured, evidence-based approach that integrates \njudicial oversight with intensive treatment, supervision, and accountability measures. \nBIDC operates programs in both Hilo and Kona, and it currently has over 100 participants, \nincluding twenty-five (25) women, engaged in substance use treatment, frequent drug \ntesting, judicial monitoring, group activities, and supportive services designed to promote \nrecovery and long-term stability. \nDue to the success of the BIDC program over the years, the Third Circuit also \nimplemented a Veterans’ Treatment Court program in 2014, as well as a Juvenile \nTreatment Court program. These programs are not standalone courts, but rather distinct \nprograms operated by drug court staff and stationed under the supervision of BIDC. This \nproposal seeks to add a Women’s Court program to the quiver of specialty programming \noffered to probationers in West Hawaiʻi, under the auspices of Kona BIDC. If the pilot \nprogram is successful, the ultimate goal would be to expand the Women’s Court program \nto Hilo and make the program permanent after the end of the 2-year project period.  \nAs is so often the case in Hawaiʻi, a one-size-fits-all approach is not always best; \ncircumstances on the neighbor islands are unique and differ from those on O‘ahu. But \nwith appropriate modifications to the proposed legislation and sufficient funding for \nservices and positions, the Third Circuit will nevertheless be able to successfully carry out \nthe purposes and intent of the proposed pilot project. By leveraging the existing BIDC \nstructure and staff at the outset, the Third Circuit will be able to supplement existing drug \ncourt services in Kona with the additional services to be provided through this measure—\nservices that justice-involved women on Hawaiʻi Island desperately need. Through a \nWomen’s Court program that is well-tailored to the Third Circuit’s unique court structure, \nand, most importantly, that is responsive to the individual needs of justice-involved \nwomen, the Judiciary looks forward to the opportunity to participate in this revolutionary \npilot project.     \nB. There Is a Need to Develop Critical Resources and Services in West Hawaiʻi. \nDue to the severe shortage of community-based treatment options on Hawaiʻi \nIsland, developing, creating, and sustaining community-wide resources and treatment \ncapacity is critical to ensuring the success of the KWC pilot project. The lack of \ncommunity-based mental health services on the island is particularly severe. In 2023, the \nfinal report of the Adult Mental Health Summit1, held by the Hawaiʻi County Mayor’s Office, \nconcluded that there are serious barriers to accessing mental health services island-wide, \n \n1 The Adult Mental Health Summit included participants from a wide-range of community stakeholders, \nincluding government agencies such as the Department of Health.  \n\n \n \n \n3 \n \n2025 Legislative Session                                                         Kona Women’s Court Proposal – Third Circuit \nand that there is a “lack of a comprehensive continuum of care”.2 The group found that in \nHawaiʻi County, there is a “lack of alternatives to hospitalization or encounters with law \nenforcement when someone is experiencing a [mental health] crisis”, with the shortage \nof mental health providers in the community standing as a significant barrier to accessing \ntreatment.3 The group underscored the pressing need for funding to attract mental health \nprofessionals to Hawaiʻi County and ensure retention.4 \nThis shortage of community-based providers is particularly acute for justice-\ninvolved women, as the few existing providers are often reluctant to take on patients with \njustice-system involvement. The providers who do take on justice-involved clients already \nhave overwhelming caseloads, which hinders their ability to provide timely and consistent \ntreatment. The community-based providers available are also located off-site, creating \npractical challenges for patients who may not have access to reliable transportation or \naccess to the technology needed for telehealth appointments. These providers also have \nestablished practices, and their ability to cater to the specific needs of women may be \nlimited. \nOnly with funding to develop community resources and provide direct services in \nWest Hawaiʻi, will KWC be able to address the individualized needs of women with a \ntrauma-informed and gender-responsive approach. Accordingly, KWC seeks funding to \ndevelop services in the following areas through contracted direct services and training for \nKWC staff:  \n• Timely Screening of At-Risk Women \n• Mental and Behavioral Health Services, Including Psychiatric Care and \nMedication Management \n• Access to Trauma-Informed Therapies that Meet Individual Needs \n• Substance Use Disorder Treatment \n• Peer Support \n• Housing \n• Cultural Activities and Practices \n• Case Management Services \n• Increased Testing and Laboratory Confirmation  \nIn addition to the development of these critical services and treatment options for \nKWC clients, program participants would also have access to established Kona drug court \nresources through available community-based services. These existing services can \nprovide classes, treatment, and support in the areas of domestic violence, including \nsurvivor counseling; education and vocational training; life-skill training, such as financial \nliteracy classes; and family support resources, including parenting classes and \n \n2 Hawaiʻi County Office of the Mayor (2023).

The Pilot Program Will Focus on West Hawaii’s Most At-Risk Women, While \nOffering Services to Priority 2 Women When Possible.  \nCurrently there are fourteen (14) women participating in the BIDC program in \nKona. These women are considered “Priority 1” clients, meaning they have been \nassessed as having a high risk for recidivism, high rates of substance abuse, and high \nmental health needs. These high-risk women nearly universally have histories of abuse, \ntrauma, poverty, and other risk factors that intersect with their involvement in the criminal \njustice system. Women who have been incarcerated are more likely to report extensive \nhistories of emotional, physical, and sexual abuse, with between 70% and 90% of \nincarcerated women reporting past abuse.5 To illustrate this reality, of the fourteen (14) \nwomen currently in Kona drug court, all have a history of trauma, and (13) thirteen have \na mental health diagnosis. These mental health diagnoses include serious conditions, \nsuch as major depressive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (“PTSD”), bipolar \ndisorder, and borderline personality disorder, which require extensive and careful \ntreatment and management.    \nOn Hawaiʻi Island, women confronted with these challenges face unique barriers \nto treatment and recovery—and not only in the area of mental health services. Hawaiʻi \nCounty is a large, rural county spanning over 4,000 square miles6; many areas of the \nisland are remote and have poor or nonexistent access to critical services, such as public \ntransportation and medical care. Hawaiʻi County also has the highest poverty rate in the \nState at 13.8%, with an average household income of only $68,3997—with the poorest \nareas of the County having a median household income of only $50,313 per year.8  \nHawaiʻi Island also has high rates of domestic violence. Between 2021 and 2023, \nthere was over a 60% increase in the number of participants in programs aimed at the \n \n5 Childhood Trauma and Women’s Health Outcomes in a California Prison Population, PubMed Central \n(Oct. 2006).

In consideration of these social realities, closing the \nservice gap for the most at-risk women in West Hawaiʻi is imperative.   \nDue to their risk-factors, all Priority 1 women currently in Kona drug court would be \nassessed and considered for the expanded, gender-responsive and individualized \nservices and programming to be offered through KWC. For the duration of the pilot \nproject, any women referred to BIDC or Veteran’s Treatment Court in Kona would also \nbe assessed for the Women’s Court program. However, due to the acute lack of \ncommunity-based services on the Big Island, especially in the areas of mental health, the \nKWC staff would also seek to provide services to Priority 2 justice-involved women, who \nhave lower risk factors, whenever possible.     \n \nPriority 2 women who would be considered for assistance would be women on \nsupervision with Hawaiʻi Intake Service Center (“HISC”) and women on regular probation \nin Kona who are not high enough risk or otherwise do not meet the eligibility criteria for \nreferral to a treatment court program. These women also experience barriers to treatment \nand lack access to mental health services, including crisis stabilization, which can \ninterfere with successful completion of probation. Currently, there are forty-five (45) \nwomen on supervision with HISC and thirty-seven (37) who are on regular probation \nsupervision in Kona, for a total of eighty-two (82) Priority 2 women who could be assessed \nfor mental health needs. The actual number of Priority 2 women who would be provided \nwith treatment, services, or other interventions, such as trauma treatment, psychiatric \nmedication, housing stabilization, case management, and linkages with other community-\nbased services would be based on the results of individual assessments.  \nWhile the focus of the pilot project is to help the most at-risk women in West \nHawaiʻi, it is anticipated that KWC staff will be able to provide critical services to many of \nthese Priority 2 women, and possibly even to some men, on a case-by-case basis. This \nwill ensure that the program’s investments in direct services are utilized to their maximum \npotential and contribute to positive outcomes for the largest number of women.  \nD. The Program \na. Eligibility Criteria & Disqualifications \nThe Third Circuit’s vision for Women’s Court aims to utilize best practice standards \nfrom the treatment court model to address the needs of Priority 1 women in a gender-\nresponsive format. Because KWC would be built on the foundation of BIDC, there is \n \n9 Domestic violence program enrollments spike on Big Island. West Hawaiʻi Today (Oct. 10, 2023). \nRetrieved on Feb. 11, 2025 from < https://www.westhawaiitoday.com/2023/10/18/hawaii-news/domestic-\nviolence-program-enrollments-spike-on-big-island/>. \n10 Id.  \n\n \n \n \n6 \n \n2025 Legislative Session                                                         Kona Women’s Court Proposal – Third Circuit \nsubstantial overlap between the proposed eligibility criteria and exclusion factors for KWC \nand those of the drug court program.  \nThe current, proposed eligibility criteria and disqualification factors for the KWC \npilot project are as follows: \n1. Proposed Eligibility Criteria: \n• Must be at least eighteen (18) years old; \n• Must reside in area supervised by Kona probation; \n• Must have a history of or evidence of current substance abuse and/or \nmental health issues; \n• Must be convicted of or on status for a felony offense; \n• Must voluntarily agree to participate in Konaa Women’s Court; and  \n• Must fully participate in the Kona Women’s Court screening process, \nincluding the LSI-R and be assessed as high risk for recidivism and as \nhaving high treatment needs. \n2. Proposed Disqualifications: \n• Convicted of any sex offense that requires or may trigger registration; \n• Convicted of an offense that carries a mandatory prison sentence; \n• Pending charges that would interfere with treatment court participation; \n• Convicted of any previous or pending Class A felony; \n• Convicted of a drug trafficking offense within the last ten (10) years; \n• Is working as a confidential informant; \n• Has been determined by the Kona Women’s Court team to suffer from \na mental illness or developmental disability that will not allow the \ndefendant to complete the program requirements, but only when it is \nalso determined that the defendant cannot be stabilized with the \nresources and services available; or \n• Is presently on status for any violent offense, defined as: \ni. Offenses that involve the discharge of a firearm or threat of harm \nwith firearm; \nii. Any offense that involves death or that results in great bodily \nharm to the victim; \niii. Class B felony violent offenses (other than sexual offenses \ncovered above).  \n\n \n \n \n7 \n \n2025 Legislative Session                                                         Kona Women’s Court Proposal – Third Circuit \nConsistent with treatment court best practices, the eligibility criteria of BIDC is \nrevised periodically to ensure that criteria are in line with current evidence and best \npractices. The eligibility criteria for KWC will also be subject to this periodic revision, to \nensure that the program is meeting the needs of the target population. As such, the \nforegoing proposed eligibility criteria and exclusion factors are likely to change over time, \nespecially if the pilot project is extended beyond the current 2-year proposal.  \nb. Referral & Screening Process \nThe KWC will accept referrals of women to the program in the same way that \nreferrals are currently made to Kona’s BIDC and Veteran’s Treatment Court programs. \nThese referrals are made by judges after defendants have been convicted of a crime, and \nwhile they are pending sentencing. The screening process will utilize best practices, \nincluding the Level of Service Inventory-Revised (“LSI-R”) assessment tool, which is a \nstandardized, evidence-based assessment tool widely used to identify an offender’s risk \nof reoffending and to inform treatment and supervision plans. Because the Third Circuit’s \nWomen’s Court structure would situate KWC under the supervision of BIDC, all women \nreferred to Kona BIDC or Veteran’s Treatment Court would also be automatically \nscreened for eligibility for the KWC program. This allows for maximum flexibility and \ntreatment options for high-risk women.  \nFor example, if a woman is a veteran who would benefit from Veteran’s Court \nprogramming, upon referral to Kona Veteran’s Court, she would also be assessed for \nKWC eligibility automatically, without the need for an additional referral. If her risk-needs \nassessment shows she would also benefit from the services and programming of KWC, \nthe proposed structure of KWC would allow such a woman to take full advantage of both \nprograms simultaneously and seamlessly, without needing to choose one or the other.   \nc. Court Sessions & Program Activities \nAs with other treatment courts, and consistent with treatment court best practices, \nKWC would hold court sessions with the judge and other members of the Women’s Court \nteam, where all women admitted to the program would participate approximately twice \nper month. Along with group court hearings, KWC would provide group activities, \nincluding group therapy, cultural activities, and peer mentorship and support on a regular \nbasis. Group sessions with the judge, as well as group programming, are essential to \nbuilding trust in the program and in the justice system. Group programming also builds \ncamaraderie and prosocial bonds between participants. These activities are also integral \nto fostering a safe, women-only environment where women can feel secure and \ncomfortable sharing openly with their peers and program staff.  \nd. Cultural Component \nBest practices dictate that culturally responsive evaluation and treatment planning \nare essential to successful treatment and recovery.11 It is vital that the programming \n \n11 See Improving Cultural Competence. Treatment Improvement Protocol (TIP) Series, No. 59. Center for \nSubstance Abuse Treatment (US). Rockville (MD): Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \n\n \n \n \n8 \n \n2025 Legislative Session                                                         Kona Women’s Court Proposal – Third Circuit \noffered by KWC is culturally sensitive and relevant to the needs of the women in the \nprogram. Over 44% of incarcerated women in Hawaiʻi are Native Hawaiian, despite \nmaking up only 19.8% of the state’s total female population.12 Therefore, the KWC \nenvisions working with Cultural Advisors to make sure that goals and program content \nare culturally relevant to maximize the benefit of the program to Native Hawaiian women \nand women from other marginalized groups.  \n   The Cultural Advisors selected will be well versed in dealing with multicultural \ngroups of women who come from a variety of backgrounds. They will employ values \nuniversal to most (if not all) cultures, presented in a Hawaiian way. No particular religion \nwill be forced, and the Cultural Advisors and KWC team will be as sensitive to as possible \nto all cultural groups.  \nE. Program Evaluation \nBesides Hawaiʻi, there are only a few other jurisdictions in the country that have \nbegun Women’s Court programs. As such, there are no established best practices for \nWomen’s Court programs. The KWC team will therefore need to thoughtfully implement \ncurrent treatment court best practices in the development of the program, such as the use \nof treatment interventions specific to women’s issues, including treatment for PTSD and \ntrauma. Because of the relatively novel nature of this trailblazing project, the program \nevaluation component will be extremely important and will involve careful study.  \nIt is anticipated that an outside researcher may be invited to do a study on the \nKWC and assist with program evaluation, due to the impacts this program may have on \nnational best practice standards. As such, the proposed budget included herein includes \nan amount for program evaluation.   \nF. Other Services \nWhile the focus of the KWC pilot project will be on developing a comprehensive \nWomen’s Court Program for Priority 1 women in West Hawaiʻi, the hope is that the \ninjection of funding and development of community-based resources through this \nprogram will benefit other justice-involved individuals, such as Priority 2 women—\nespecially those needing critical mental health services. These “extracurricular” services \nwould be offered on a case-by-case basis when determined appropriate by the KWC \nteam, and only when doing so would not detract from the services needed for Priority 1 \nwomen in the KWC program.  \nAllowing the flexibility of providing services to individuals outside the KWC program \nwill ensure that the resources furnished through this pilot project are being utilized to their \n \nAdministration (US); 2014.

The Team \nBecause the KWC pilot project will use the pre-existing staff and structures of the \nBIDC program to address the needs of women already participating in drug court, the \nKWC team will consist of the dedicated team of BIDC probation officers and staff, as well \nas specially trained professionals in direct service provider positions. Due to the lack of \ncommunity-based service providers on the Big Island, discussed in detail above, funding \nsufficient to recruit and retain full-time mental health professionals, as well as funding for \nadequate training of program staff, are absolutely imperative to the success of the pilot \nproject. Only through the development of new services will the KWC be able to guarantee \nthat women in the program will have both access to necessary services and consistency \nof treatment.  \nTherefore, this proposal seeks funding for the following service provider positions \nand services: \n1. Women’s Mental Health Professional (1FTE) (POS Contractor(s)): KWC \nwould seek to hire a Women’s Mental Health Professional. This mental health \nprofessional would have a full-time equivalent (“FTE”) position and would be \nassigned to the Keahuolū courthouse, to enable them to provide consistent and \ntimely mental and behavioral health services. This mental health professional \nwould ensure timely screening of at-risk women, including at the jail, at the \ncourthouse, or in the community, and they would be able to provide treatment \ndirectly, including treatment for trauma, substance use disorder, and mental \nhealth issues specific to women. They would also be available to help stabilize \njustice-involved women, so that the legal process can take place and \ncommunity-based treatments can begin. Additionally, this professional would \nbe able to offer medication assisted treatment and a variety of therapies, \nincluding behavioral therapies, group therapy, and more. Having a dedicated, \nfull-time Women’s Mental Health Professional to provide direct services and \nassist clients with referrals and connections with longer-term treatment, crisis \nstabilization, case management, Department of Health services, and other \ncommunity mental health resources is critical to ensuring continuity of care for \nwomen in the program.  \n2. Women’s Behavioral Health Beds (POS Contractor(s)): To facilitate \neffective treatment, recovery, and case management, it is essential to have \nbeds available in facilities that will provide support staff to address substance \nuse issues and facilitate mental health treatment, including crisis stabilization \nand medication compliance. Currently there are no dual-diagnosis beds \navailable to probationers in the Third Circuit. Funding for behavioral health beds \nwould ensure that the highest-risk women have access to secure, women-only \nhousing where they can receive support for all of their needs. With the funds \n\n \n \n \n10 \n \n2025 Legislative Session                                                         Kona Women’s Court Proposal – Third Circuit \nrequested in the proposed budget outlined below, it is anticipated that one of \nthe service providers already contracted to provide bedspaces to Kona drug \ncourt clients will be able to dedicate a house specifically for women in KWC—\nwith anywhere from three (3) to six (6) bedspaces being reserved for KWC’s \nexclusive use at any given time.  \n3. Cultural Practitioner(s) & Advisor(s) (POS Contractor(s)): Best practices \nhave long dictated that culturally responsive and culturally relevant evaluation, \nobjectives, and treatment result in better outcomes for individuals receiving \nsubstance abuse and mental health treatment. KWC would utilize Cultural \nAdvisors to run cultural activities and group sessions. Cultural Advisors would \nalso assist the KWC team to ensure treatment goals and methods are culturally \nrelevant, and that individual treatment plans and the services provided by the \nprogram are sensitive to participants’ backgrounds, beliefs, and practices, to \nthe extent possible.  \n4. Drug Court Peer Specialist(s) (1FTE) (POS Contractor(s)): Mentorship \nplays a vital role in substance abuse treatment, because it provides a crucial \nlayer of support, accountability, and shared experience for individuals in \naddiction recovery. While mentorship is considered a best practice in \nsubstance abuse treatment, it is particularly critical for women to have access \nto effective mentorship, as studies have shown that women are less \ncomfortable talking about substance use than their male counterparts, and less \nlikely to seek help or treatment.13 KWC would hire former female drug court \ngraduates in peer support roles to ensure that participants in the program \nreceive mentorship that is responsive to the unique needs of women.  \nIn addition to these essential positions, KWC will also seek funding for a Probation \nSupervisor position, as well as for funding for training of KWC staff. \n5. Kona Probation Supervisor (1FTE) (Judiciary Staff): Additional staffing \nwithin the probation division will be necessary to manage and implement KWC \ndeliverables for program participants. There is already an existing gap in Kona \nprobation, where the BIDC probation officers currently lack a supervisor. In all \nother probation divisions there is supervisor position for every 3-4 probation \nofficers. The added supervision and administrative burdens of an additional \ntreatment court program will necessitate that this gap in staffing be addressed.  \n6. KWC Staff Training: Within the first year of the pilot project, KWC would seek \nto have its team members participate in available local and online trainings. In \nyear two (2) of the program, the Kona team, consisting of up to fifteen (15) team \n \n13 See Women’s barriers to specialty substance abuse treatment: A qualitative exploration of racial/ethnic \ndifferences.

All Rise is the \nnational organization for training in the treatment court model15, and it is the \nauthor of the Adult Treatment Court Best Practice Standards—considered the \ngold standard for treatment courts nationally. Training and conference \nattendance is essential to ensure that the KWC program is implementing \ntreatment court best practices, based on the most current evidence available. \nAdditionally, as Hawaiʻi is one of the first states in the nation to implement a \nWomen’s Court program, conference attendance will provide significant \nopportunities to spread the Women’s Court model to other jurisdictions.    \nFinally, the KWC program would seek to contract with vendors and providers to \nprovide access to Moral Reconation Therapy (“MRT”) and increased drug testing and \ngreater laboratory confirmation capacities. KWC is also seeking funding for technology to \nsupport program operations, including computer workstations, so that program \nparticipants can have reliable internet access. \n7. Moral Reconation Therapy & Training (Contracted): KWC will seek to \ncontract with therapists who can provide MRT group sessions to program \nparticipants and train KWC staff in the MRT methodology. MRT is a cognitive \nbehavioral therapy designed to address severe criminal thinking. It is effective \nin treating substance abuse, trauma, patterns of domestic violence, and other \nissues that intersect with women’s involvement in criminal behavior. Studies \nhave shown that offenders who receive MRT are far less likely to be re-arrested \nor re-incarcerated. One study that tracked nearly 1,400 participants over 20 \nyears found that the use of MRT reduced the likelihood of an offender being re-\nincarcerated by nearly 30%.16  By training the KWC staff in MRT, the program \ncan build the capacity to sustainably provide justice-involved women with the \ntools needed to change their thought processes, make better decisions, and \nultimately reduce recidivism.  \n8. Increased Drug Testing & Greater Laboratory Confirmation Capabilities \n(Vendors): Funding for increased capacity and effectiveness of drug testing \nand laboratory confirmation will be essential to monitoring the compliance of \n \n14 Teams would include the KWC probation officers, probation supervisor, assigned judge, service \nproviders, and, funding permitted, the assigned Deputy Public Defender, Deputy Prosecuting Attorney, \nand Hawaiʻi Police Department Officer.   \n15 All Rise began 30 years ago as the National Association of Drug Court Professionals. In 2023, the \norganization rebranded as “All Rise” to reflect the organization’s focus on all treatment courts, including \nFamily Treatment Court, DUI Court, Juvenile Treatment Court, and others.  \n16 20-year study finds MRT Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy reduces re-arrests and re-incarceration.

With the \nintegration of critical mental health services and treatment through the pilot \nproject, program staff will need the ability to confirm compliance with psychiatric \nand other prescribed medication through laboratory testing. The use of sweat \npatches and Smartstart technology for KWC will also ensure that participants \ncan be adequately monitored for compliance with drug and alcohol conditions \nwhile in the community, when standard urine testing is not practical. For \nexample, if a client needs to travel the mainland for medical treatment, currently \nthere is no way to monitor her compliance during the travel period. With a sweat \npatch, the client’s probation officer would be able to verify compliance. \n9. Technology: As set forth in the proposed program budget below, funding is \nbeing sought for technology to support program operations, including \ncomputers for additional staff, as well as a computer workstation in the Kona \nprobation waiting area. This workstation would be available for clients to use \nfor job applications and searches, applications to educational and training \nprograms, housing applications, and similar, essential administrative tasks. \nMany justice-involved women in our rural community lack reliable access to the \ninternet at home. Internet access is required to do the most basic of tasks in \nour modern, digital world. Having computers available so that program \nparticipants have guaranteed access to the internet every time they come to \ncourt would be a significant step to closing this digital divide.   \nB. 2-Year Pilot Program Budget \n \nTwo-Year Pilot Program Budget: \n \n \n \n \nYear 1\nYear 2\nServices\nAnnual Cost\nAnnual Cost\nn\nTotal Cost\nWomen's Mental Health Professional (1FTE)\n175,000.00\n$                \n175,000.00\n$               \n350,000.00\n$                 \nWomens Behavioral  Health Beds\n100,000.00\n$                \n100,000.00\n$               \n200,000.00\n$                 \nKona Drug Court  Probation Supervisor (1FTE)\n85,000.00\n$                  \n85,000.00\n$                 \n170,000.00\n$                 \nCultural Practitioner and Advisor\n30,000.00\n$                  \n30,000.00\n$                 \n60,000.00\n$                   \nPeer Specialist (1FTE)\n80,000.00\n$                  \n80,000.00\n$                 \n160,000.00\n$                 \nMoral Reconation Therapy\n25,000.00\n$                  \n25,000.00\n$                 \n50,000.00\n$                   \nIncreased Drug Testing/Lab confirmation\n10,000.00\n$                  \n10,000.00\n$                 \n20,000.00\n$                   \nTraining\n5,000.00\n$                    \n42,000.00\n$                 \n47,000.00\n$                   \nTechnology\n4,900.00\n$                    \n-\n$                              \n4,900.00\n$                      \nProgram Evaluation\n-\n$                               \n10,000.00\n$                 \n10,000.00\n$                   \nTotal\n514,900.00\n$                \n557,000.00\n$               \n1,071,900.00\n$             \n\n \n \n \n13 \n \n2025 Legislative Session                                                         Kona Women’s Court Proposal – Third Circuit \nBreakdown of Estimated Training Costs: \n \n \nBreakdown of Estimated Technology Costs: \n \n \nTraining:\nCost\nYear 1:  Local and Other Trainings\n$5,000\nYear 2:  Kona Team : All Rise National Conference \n(Washington DC)\n42,000.00\n$          \nTotal Training Cost:\n$47,000\nTechnology:\nKona Cost\nComputer Workstation (in Probation Waiting A\n1,200.00\n$           \nComputer for Kona Probation Supervisor\n1,000.00\n$           \nPrinter for Kona Probation Supervisor\n1,000.00\n$           \nCellphone for Field Work Kona Prob .

No. 727, HD 1: RELATING TO THE WOMEN’S COURT \n \nChair Rhoads, Vice-Chair Gabbard, and Members of the Committee: \n \nThe Office of the Public Defender strongly supports HB 727, HD1.  This bill \nestablishes a three-year women’s court pilot program in the Second and Fifth \ncircuits, and requires the Third to conduct an interim study to establish a blueprint \nfor a women’s court pilot program.  The Office of the Public Defender regularly \nrepresents women in the criminal legal system and knows first-hand the unique \nneeds and issues facing these clients.  Often their involvement in the criminal legal \nsystem is directly related to trauma, abuse, or unhealthy relationships, and they \nwould greatly benefit from gender-responsive programming.   \n \nThe implementation of the women’s court program in the first circuit, known as \nMohala Wahine, has been thus far successful, with the Office of the Public Defender \nrepresenting most of the participants in the program.   The collaboration with the \ncourt, the prosecutor’s office, probation department, and service providers has \nallowed the women to receive focused services with the support and resources \nnecessary to obtain positive outcomes.  \n \nExpansion to the other circuits would allow the program to assist more women in \nneed and divert them away from incarceration.   \n \nThank you for the opportunity to comment on this measure. \n \n \n \n \nJON N.

This measure would establish a temporary three-year women's court \npilot program within the Second and Fifth Circuits, require the Third Circuit of the \nJudiciary and Big Island Drug Court to conduct an interim study to establish a blueprint \nfor a women's court pilot program in the Third Circuit, require reports, establish temporary \npositions, and appropriate funds. \nEstablished by HRS§367-4, the Hawai‘i County Committee on the Status of Women \n(HCCSW) is charged with the duty and responsibility of developing information as the \nstate commission on the status of women requires or as the committee deems advisable \nconcerning the status of women within Hawai‘i County; and other appropriate duties and \nresponsibilities as may be deemed necessary. To this end, the HCCSW defers to the \nJudiciary as the subject matter expert on the details of this measure and provides this \ntestimony in support for the following reasons.  \n \nThe HCCSW, in advocacy for Hawai‘i Island women who could benefit from this \nmeasure, sees this program as an alternative to incarceration for women and as \nimportantly, supporting Hawai‘i Island mothers, daughters, sisters, and friends. As a \nresult of different life situations due to trauma, abuse, unhealthy relationships and more, \nmany women on Hawai‘i Island are in need of substance abuse treatment, mental health \nsupport, and assistance with navigating the criminal and social services systems.  \n \nWith this measure, we ask that the vastness of Hawai‘i Island, also known as the Big \nIsland, be kept in mind. We encourage adequate support and funding for proper \nimplementation to ensure access across the entire island. \n \nThank you for this opportunity to provide testimony on this measure that has great \npotential for assisting Hawai‘i Island women in need. \n \n\n \n \n \nHawai’i County is an Equal Opportunity Provider and Employer \n \n \n \nKELDEN B.A. WALTJEN \nPROSECUTING ATTORNEY \n \nSHANNON M.

By \nsupporting funding and staffing, for programs like Mohala Wahine which incorporates intensive \ncase management and supervision, psychoeducational group work, community engagement, and \naftercare and commencement, we hope to address jail overcrowding concerns, assist incarcerated \npersons reintegrating back into society, and reduce recidivism. \n \n\n \n2\nFor the foregoing reasons, the County of Hawai‘i, Office of the Prosecuting Attorney \nsupports the passage of House Bill No. 727, H.D. 1. Thank you for the opportunity to testify on \nthis matter.  \n \n\n \n \nHB727 HD1 Women’s Court \nCOMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY \nSenator Karl Rhoads, Chair \nSenator Mike Gabbard, Vice Chair \nWednesday, Mar 19, 2025: 9:45: Room 016 Videoconference \n \n \n \nHawaii Substance Abuse Coalition Supports HB727 HD1: \n \nALOHA CHAIR, VICE CHAIR, AND DISTINGUISHED COMMITTEE MEMBERS. My \nname is Alan Johnson. I am the current chair of the Hawaii Substance Abuse Coalition \n(HSAC), a statewide organization for substance use disorder and co-occurring mental \nhealth disorder treatment and prevention agencies and recovery-oriented services. \n \n \nHSAC supports a 3-year pilot program and interim study for a gender responsive \napproach to women who are justice-involved. \n \nRecovery can be complex because recovery involves a multitude of issues such as \ntrauma, substance use disorder, mental illness, unhealthy relationships, domestic \nviolence, sexual assault, and family law disputes. Courts can ensure a collaboration \nwith multiple providers to implement evidenced-based behavioral health practices to \nsupport their full recovery and not return to incarceration.   \nFormal substance abuse with mental illness treatment, \nsuch as residential and intensive outpatient, is still the \nmost effective approach to achieve functionality and \nlasting recovery for justice-involved women.  \n \nSubstance use disorder coupled with mental health treatment is essential for \noffenders because it addresses the underlying issues that often contribute to criminal \nbehavior and helps break the cycle of addiction and recidivism. Gender-responsive \nwomen’s courts are effective because they address the unique needs and challenges \nwomen face: \n \n1. Trauma-Informed Approach. Women’s courts often adopt trauma-\ninformed practices, ensuring that the court process is sensitive to the \nemotional, psychological, and physical impact of trauma on survivors. This \nfosters an environment where women feel safe, heard, and respected. \n\n  \n2. High Rates of Substance Abuse Among Offenders: Many offenders \nstruggle with substance use disorders. Studies show that a significant \nproportion of crimes, including theft, assault, and drug-related offenses, are \ncommitted under the influence of drugs or alcohol. \n \n3. Addresses Root Causes of Criminal Behavior: Substance abuse often \ncoexists with mental health issues, trauma, or socioeconomic challenges. \nTreatment programs can provide a comprehensive approach to addressing \nthese interconnected factors. Treating substance abuse can lower the \nlikelihood of reoffending. Offenders who receive effective treatment are more \nlikely to develop coping skills and lead crime-free lives after release. \n \n4. Specialized Training for Judges and Staff: Judges, attorneys, and court \nstaff in women’s courts typically receive specialized training in gender \ndynamics, domestic violence, and trauma. This equips them to make \ninformed, fair decisions and avoid perpetuating biases or re-traumatizing \nsurvivors. \n \n5. Integrated Social Services: Women’s courts often partner with social \nservices, offering survivors access to counseling, housing assistance, legal aid, \nchildcare, and job training. This holistic approach addresses the underlying \nissues that women face, helping them rebuild their lives. \n \n6. Empowering Women: By creating a supportive and understanding \nenvironment, women’s courts help survivors regain confidence, independence, \nand control over their lives, encouraging long-term recovery and stability \nwhile simultaneously holding perpetrators accountable while ensuring victim \nsafety. \n \nThis focused approach ensures that justice-involved women are given an opportunity \nto rebuild their lives, contributing positively to society rather than being trapped in \ncycles of crime and incarceration. \n \nWe appreciate the opportunity to provide testimony and are available for questions. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nHB-727-HD-1 \nSubmitted on: 3/18/2025 9:25:14 AM \nTestimony for JDC on 3/19/2025 9:45:00 AM \nSubmitted By \nOrganization \nTestifier Position \nTestify \nKori Weinberger \nTestifying for West \nHawaii Bar Association \nSupport \nRemotely Via \nZoom \n \n \nComments:  \nDear Chair Rhoads, Vice Chair Gabbard, and Members of this Honorable Committee,  \nAs the Vice-President of the West Hawaii Bar Association and a former Drug Court prosecutor, I \nfully support the Third Circuit's proposal for the creation of a women's court program in Kona. \nThe Big Island does not have a functioning mental health system. The lack of providers here \nmeans that even people like myself, with a good salary and benefits, struggle to find care locally. \nThis lack of providers means that people who are struggling financially or who find themselves \nin a mental health crisis often have nowhere to go. These challenges can be insurmountable for \nmany criminal defendants with mental health needs, and the impact on justice-involved women, \nwho are often the sole caregivers to dependent children, can be catastrophic.   \nThe proposal for a women's court in Kona would mean that new mental health providers \ncould be attracted to the community, and these providers would be able to provide care to many \nwomen through the treatment court model. As a former drug court prosecutor, I have seen \nfirsthand how effective the treatment court model can be.  \nI fully support the Third Circuit's proposal for a women's court pilot project in Kona, and would \nhumbly ask this committee to allow this program to move forward and provide the funding for \nthe mental health providers that this community so desperately needs. \nThank you for your time and for the opportunity to testify on this bill.  \n/s/ Kori Weinberger \n \n\nCOMMUNITY ALLIANCE ON PRISONS \nP.O.

This \ntestimony is respectfully offered on behalf of the 3,720 Hawai`i individuals living behind bars1 \nand under the “care and custody” of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation as of \nMarch 10, 2025. We are always mindful that 936 – 49.3% - of Hawai`i’s male prison population \n(1,895) are serving their sentences abroad -- thousands of miles away from their loved ones, their \nhomes and, for the disproportionate number of incarcerated Kanaka Maoli, far, far from their \nancestral lands. \n \nMahalo for the opportunity to show our strong support for HB 727 HD1 that establishes a \n3-year women’s court project pilot program within the 2nd and 5th Circuit.  It requires the 3rd \nCircuit and the Hawai`i Island Drug Court to conduct the an interim study to establish a blueprint \nfor a women’s court pilot program in the 3rd Circuit. \n \nThis bill acknowledges that women’s pathways to incarceration are different and we are, \ntherefore, happy to see trauma-informed and gender-responsivity being the focus for this court. \n \nJudge Kim from Hawai`i Island has been at hearings helping O`ahu legislators understand \nthe resource challenges of our neighbor islands. We know we don’t have enough programs and \nservices on O`ahu; this is magnified on our outer islands.  \n \nCommunity Alliance on Prisons commends Judge Kim for his belief that we can do more \nand his willingness to find ways to serve the people on our neighbor islands!  Imua, Judge Kim! \n \nWe hope that WAM funds this important effort and that Hawai`i will reduce our current \npopulation of incarcerated women - 402 (10.8% of Hawai`i’s incarcerated population) \nsubstantially!    \n \nMahalo nui! \n \n1 DCR Weekly Population Report, March 10, 2025 \nhttps://dcr.hawaii.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Pop-Reports-Weekly-2025-03-10.pdf \n \n \u0010\u0005\u0018\t\n\nHB-727-HD-1 \nSubmitted on: 3/16/2025 12:09:45 PM \nTestimony for JDC on 3/19/2025 9:45:00 AM \nSubmitted By \nOrganization \nTestifier Position \nTestify \nColleen Rost-Banik \nIndividual \nSupport \nWritten Testimony \nOnly \n \n \nComments:  \nDear Committee on the Judiciary, \nMy name is Colleen Rost-Banik. I am a Sociology instructor at University of Hawaii, Manoa, \nand I facilitate a creative writing class at the Women's Community Correctional Center. I \nstrongly support HB727, which establishes a pilot program of the Women's Court, with the \nexpansion to neighbor islands. Having worked with numerous women at WCCC, I have heard \ncountless stories about the challenging situations that they have had to navigate as \nvictims/survivors of abuse while also trying to care for their children. Sometimes all of this is on \ntop of substance addiction, often used as a coping strategy for the trauma they've experienced. \nSuffice it to say that many of the women who are incarcerated have lives that are extremely \ncomplicated. Women's Court is designed to take these complexities into consideration. Please \nsupport HB727. It will be a step toward ensuring the betterment of Hawaii's women and their \nfamilies. \nMahalo for your consideration. \nColleen Rost-Banik, Ph.D. \n \n\nHB-727-HD-1 \nSubmitted on: 3/16/2025 3:10:56 PM \nTestimony for JDC on 3/19/2025 9:45:00 AM \nSubmitted By \nOrganization \nTestifier Position \nTestify \nCarla Allison \nIndividual \nSupport \nWritten Testimony \nOnly \n \n \nComments:  \nI strongly support HB727 HD1. \n \n\n \nAloha my name is Genesis Kepo’o. I am writing in support of HB 727, relating to the \nimportance of a Women’s Court, here on the island of Hawai’i. \n \nI am originally from the island of Kaua’I and moved to Hawaii island in 2002. I am the \noldest of 3 and as such the burden of taking care of my younger siblings fell to me at a \nyoung age. Having to “grow up” at a young age, I got caught up with experimentation during \nmiddle & high school.  \n \nFor most of my adult life I used off and on, until I couldn’t. I found myself being \narrested and having to navigate my way through the judicial system. I attempted to comply \nwith regular probationary rules but found I just couldn’t stay clean. During a revocation that \nhad me spend 30 days in jail, I heard about Drug Court. Of course, it was “don’t do it,” \n“you’ll never be able to get out of it,” and so on.  \n \nI was ready to be done and move on with my life so when my probation officer \nbrought up Drug Court, I jumped at the chance. I needed someone to hold me accountable \nand keep me on the right track. I graduated in May 2023 and have been able to remain \nclean. Drug Court helps to get you the tools you need to lead an honest & productive life. \nSince then, I have worked in a treatment center and currently work in the mental health \nfield.  \n \nHB 727 is important to bring awareness to individual needs and how to lower \nrecidivism. Women are hard wired to take on others’ problems, stress, feelings, you name \nit, we want to fix it for you. With that mentality, anyone would crack. Women require more \nsupport whether we know it or not. By creating a Women’s court, it would reduce the \nnumber of women in jail, keeping families together. Having Women’s Mental & Behavioral \nHealth available to help with SUD and mental health issues will help destigmatize getting \nhelp. There’s nothing wrong with needing help, having it available would make it easier to \nget. It would create a safe place to find help. \n \nThere is nothing better than being able to talk with someone you know has come \nfrom similar situations as you and made it through the dark tunnel, back into the sun. Peer \nsupport and getting back to your roots are by far some of the best therapy there can be. \nSomeone who can help you through those dark times by showing you the way. Recentering \nand getting back into cultural practices with a knowledgeable teacher can do more for \nmind, body, & spirit. For both women and men! \n \nPlease support HB 727, relating to Women’s Court. \n \nMahalo, \nGenesis L E Kepo’o \n\nHB-727-HD-1 \nSubmitted on: 3/18/2025 8:54:45 AM \nTestimony for JDC on 3/19/2025 9:45:00 AM \nSubmitted By \nOrganization \nTestifier Position \nTestify \nRachel Thompson \nIndividual \nSupport \nWritten Testimony \nOnly \n \n \nComments:  \nDear Chair Rhoads, Vice Chair Gabbard, and Committee Members: \nI write in strong support of HB 727, which seeks to establish a Women’s Court pilot program in \nKona within the Third Circuit Judiciary.  \nAs a Deputy Public Defender serving justice-involved individuals on the Big Island, I have \nwitnessed firsthand the challenges that women face in the criminal justice system—challenges \nthat this bill seeks to address. \nWomen involved in the justice system, particularly those struggling with substance use, trauma, \nand economic hardship, have vastly different needs than their male counterparts. Yet, our system \nis not designed to provide the gender-specific support necessary to break cycles of incarceration.  \nThe proposed Women’s Court would create much needed programs,  focused on treatment, \nrehabilitation, and alternatives to incarceration, ensuring that justice-involved women receive \ntrauma-informed, culturally appropriate, and community-based interventions.

Yet, our system \nis not designed to provide the gender-specific support necessary to break cycles of incarceration. \nThe proposed Women’s Court would create much needed programs, focused on treatment, \nrehabilitation, and alternatives to incarceration, ensuring that justice-involved women receive \ntrauma-informed, culturally appropriate, and community-based interventions.

I have seen the positive impact that focused court systems \ncan offer, but also the need for an increased focus on trauma informed systems within the justice \nsystem. This is particularly important for women who are justice involved, who often have \nexperienced a disproportionate amount of trauma in their lives.  \nHB 727 would help establish a space where women can engage with the justice system in a more \nsupportive environment, resuling in improved outcomes for the community in addition to making \na difference to the lives of women in the justice system. \nI ask lawmakers to approve this pilot program with HB 727.  \n  \nMahalo for your consideration, \nKatherine Knezek May \nClinical Psychologist \n \n\nHB-727-HD-1 \nSubmitted on: 3/18/2025 9:39:56 AM \nTestimony for JDC on 3/19/2025 9:45:00 AM \nSubmitted By \nOrganization \nTestifier Position \nTestify \nAndi Pawasarat-Losalio \nIndividual \nSupport \nWritten Testimony \nOnly \n \n \nComments:  \nChairperson and Members of the Committee, \n \nI am submitting testimony in strong support of House Bill 727 HD1, which seeks to expand the \nWomen’s Court pilot program. As a professional that provides services for substance use \ndisorder treatment continuum of care services,  I have witnessed firsthand the unique challenges \nthat justice-involved women face, particularly those with histories of trauma, substance use \ndisorders, and economic instability. \n \nWomen in the criminal justice system often arrive there due to a confluence of systemic issues, \nincluding untreated mental health conditions, lack of stable housing, and experiences of abuse \nand exploitation. Traditional judicial approaches frequently fail to address these underlying \nfactors, leading to higher rates of recidivism and continued involvement in the justice system. \nThe Women’s Court model, offers a holistic and trauma-informed alternative that provides the \nnecessary support for long-term success and reintegration into the community. \n \nThrough my work, I have seen that when women receive the necessary support—such as \nsubstance use disorder treatment, housing assistance, skill-building opportunities, and \ncommunity support—they are significantly more likely to achieve stability and become \ncontributing members of their communities. The expansion of this program, along with a study \non implementation in the Third Circuit, would provide essential resources and alternative \npathways for women struggling with the cyclical nature of incarceration. \nFurthermore, the proposed appropriations for mental health, substance use disorder treatment, \nand other rehabilitative services are crucial investments in breaking the cycle of incarceration, \nespecially for women. Without stable housing and recovery-focused services, many women are \nreleased back into environments that do not support their rehabilitation, ultimately leading to \nreoffending.  \n \nI urge you to pass HB 727 HD1 to continue the critical work of providing solutions that address \nthe unique challenges faced by women in the justice system. Expanding the Women’s Court \nmodel is a necessary step toward reducing recidivism, promoting stability, and fostering healthier \ncommunities across Hawaii. \n\n \nThank you for your time and consideration. \n \nRespectfully submitted, \nAndi Pawasarat-Losalio \n \n\nHB-727-HD-1 \nSubmitted on: 3/18/2025 6:42:59 PM \nTestimony for JDC on 3/19/2025 9:45:00 AM \nSubmitted By \nOrganization \nTestifier Position \nTestify \nBarbara J.

Kim \nChief Court Administrator \nThird Circuit Court \n \n \nBill No. and Title: House Bill No. 727, H.D. 1, S.D. 1, Relating to the Women’s Court. \n \nPurpose: Makes the Women's Court Pilot Program in the First Circuit permanent.  Establishes \na temporary three-year Women's Court Pilot Program within the Kona division of the Third \nCircuit.  Requires reports.  Establishes temporary positions.  Appropriates funds.  Sunsets \n6/30/2028.  Effective 4/23/2057.  (SD1) \n \nJudiciary's Position:  \n \nThe Judiciary supports this bill that would establish a three-year Women’s Court Pilot \nProject in the Third Circuit.  However, the Judiciary respectfully requests modifications to the \nappropriations under this bill that would allow the pilot project to be fully funded through fiscal \nyear 2027-2028.  Attached to this testimony is a detailed proposal for the establishment of a \nKona Women’s Court (“KWC”) pilot project in the Third Circuit.  This proposal—originally \nsubmitted as a proposal for a two-year pilot project—has been updated to reflect the current \nversion of the bill, which calls for a three-year pilot project.  As set forth in the proposed budget, \nthe cost for a three-year pilot project would be $514,000 for fiscal year 2025-2026; $547,000 for \nfiscal year 2026-2027; and $515,000 for fiscal year 2027-2028.    \n \nThe Judiciary supports the current version of this bill, which would situate this pilot \nproject under the supervision of Big Island Drug Court (“BIDC”).  Our proposal calls for the \nKWC program to be supervised by the Kona Division of BIDC.  This administrative structure is \n \u0010\u0005\u0018\t\n\nHouse Bill No. 727, H.D. 1, S.D. 1, Relating to the Women’s Court \nSenate Committee on Ways and Means \n \nMonday, March 31, 2025 \n \nPage 2  \n \n \nsimilar to the other successful treatment court programs currently offered in the Third Circuit.  \nBy situating KWC under the supervision of BIDC with our other treatment court programs, the \nexisting BIDC structure and staff can be leveraged at the outset of the program, allowing us to \nsupplement existing services with the additional resources to be provided by this bill.  This \nstructure will maximize existing resources and allow the program to focus its efforts on \ndeveloping the programming and services that are at the heart of this project.  \n \nAdditionally, to be an effective use of resources, the KWC program will require a critical \nmass of female probationers in West Hawaiʻi who may be eligible for the program.  The highest-\nrisk justice-involved women in the Third Circuit are already participating in the BIDC program.  \nThus, our proposal calls for all fourteen (14) of the women currently participating in the Kona \nBIDC program to be screened for eligibility for the KWC program. This will allow the program \nto begin providing services to the target population immediately, instead of waiting for \nindividual referrals to trickle in for a standalone program.  If the pilot program is successful, the \nultimate goal would be to expand the women’s court program to Hilo and make the program \npermanent after the end of the 3-year project period.    \n \nTo be successful, the BIWC will require sufficient funding and positions, and a good \nprospect of recruiting qualified staff for those positions.  The Judiciary’s proposal contemplates a \ntrauma-informed and gender-responsive program tailored to the unique needs of high-risk \nwomen, with robust mental health, therapeutic, and rehabilitative components.  The proposal also \ncalls for a cultural competency component and staff in peer support roles, with all programing to \nbe provided in an atmosphere that holds women accountable while providing court-supervised \ntreatment, opportunities, and resources.  \n \nA truly trauma-informed approach to this program will require extensive mental health \ncounseling by trained psychologists, psychiatrists, and/or mental health counselors.  These \nmental health services are severely deficient on Hawaiʻi Island, where a lack of community-\nbased mental health providers often proves to be an insurmountable barrier to treatment.  \nMoreover, our current BIDC staff are not equipped or sufficiently resourced to address these \ncomplex issues without comprehensive training.  Thus, our proposal for a KWC has a strong \nfocus on the development of mental health services, with the hiring of full-time equivalent \nproviders, funding for the creation of new services, and training for program staff. \n \nThe Judiciary has consulted with the sponsors of this bill—Representative Linda \nIchiyama and Representative Mahina Poepoe—in the development of the attached proposal.  \nGiven that this HD1, SD1 contemplates a three-year pilot, the only modification to the current \nbill that is being requested is additional appropriations to ensure that the pilot project is fully \nfunded for the duration of the project period.  The proposed budget for KWC is just over $1.5 \nmillion in total for the three-year pilot project.  This investment in KWC will ultimately result in \n\nHouse Bill No. 727, H.D. 1, S.D. 1, Relating to the Women’s Court \nSenate Committee on Ways and Means \n \nMonday, March 31, 2025 \n \nPage 3  \n \n \ncost savings.  The cost of incarceration of just one person for three years is $277,035.1  This \nmeans that if KWC helps keep just six (6) women out of prison, the program will have already \npaid for itself, and it is anticipated that this program will help many more women than that.     \n \nIf the Legislature is supportive of the Judiciary’s proposal, we welcome continued \ndiscussions during this session.  The Third Circuit and BIDC stand ready to assist the legislature \nin whatever policy decision is made, as long as we have the requested mental health \nprofessionals on contract or hired by the Judiciary, along with additional staff members to be \nhired by BIDC. \n \n \nThank you for the opportunity to offer testimony on this important bill. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1 The average cost of housing an inmate in Hawaiʻi is $253 dollars per day, which totals $92,945 per year. \nSee Hawaiʻi Prison Chief Wants Department Changes To Bring ‘Paradigm Shift’, Civil Beat, Retrieved \non 03-29-25 from <https://www.civilbeat.org/2023/12/hawaii-prison-chief-wants-department-changes-to-\nbring-paradigm-shift/>. \n\n \n \n \n1 \n \n2025 Legislative Session                                                         Kona Women’s Court Proposal – Third Circuit \nKONA WOMEN’S COURT:  \nA Proposal for a Women’s Justice and Treatment Program in West Hawaiʻi \nPilot Program: 3 Years \n \n \nI. \nSUMMARY \nThis proposal for the formation of a Kona Women’s Court (“KWC”) program as a \n3-year pilot project under the umbrella of the well-established Big Island Drug Court \n(“BIDC”). By developing KWC under the pre-existing drug court program, the KWC pilot \nproject will use the established structures of drug court as its “backbone”, thereby \nenabling the development of a successful program, notwithstanding the practical \nlimitations of the Third Circuit’s dual-docket courts. Positioning the KWC program under \nthe supervision of drug court will also guarantee the most effective use of resources and \nmaximum benefit to the target population of women that the Women’s Court model aims \nto serve. The KWC program requires a critical mass of women participants, and all of the \nfourteen (14) women already participating in Kona BIDC are at high risk for recidivism, \nhave high rates of substance abuse, and have high mental health needs. This proposal \ntherefore envisions KWC as a division of Kona drug court with distinct eligibility \nrequirements, gender-responsive programming, and mental health services and \ntreatment options that are specially designed to address the needs of justice-involved \nwomen in Hawaiʻi Island’s rural community.  \nII. \nPURPOSE \nA. Due to Resource Requirements and the Structure of the Circuit Courts in the \nThird Circuit, There Is a Need to Develop the Women’s Court Program under \nthe Auspices of Big Island Drug Court. \n The Circuit Courts of the Third Circuit are structured very differently from those in \nthe First Circuit. There are only four (4) Circuit Court judges in the Third Circuit, and all of \nthem, including the two (2) judges assigned to drug court, are responsible for hearing all \ncase types, including all criminal and civil cases, agency appeals, environmental court \ncases, special proceedings, and more. Moreover, due to Hawaiʻi Island’s size, the Third \nCircuit is the only circuit with two courthouses housing Circuit Courts. These courthouses \nare situated nearly 100 miles apart, and each courthouse services distinct geographic \nareas of the island—the Hilo Circuit Court hears cases from East Hawaiʻi, including the \ndistricts of North and South Hilo, Puna, and Hāmākua, and the Kona Circuit Court hears \ncases from West Hawaiʻi, including the districts of North and South Kona, North and South \nKohala, and Kaʻū.  \nBecause of the Circuit Court’s dual-docket calendars and the geography of the \nisland, it has never been feasible in the Third Circuit to have single, standalone specialty \ncourts dedicated exclusively to the treatment court model, as has been done successfully \nin the First Circuit.  Nevertheless, the Third Circuit has a long history of the successful \nimplementation of the treatment court model in spite of these limitations, beginning with \nthe BIDC program. \n\n \n \n \n2 \n \n2025 Legislative Session                                                         Kona Women’s Court Proposal – Third Circuit \nBig Island Drug Court is a specialty treatment court first established in the Third \nCircuit over twenty (20) years ago, in 2002. The BIDC program is dedicated to reducing \nrecidivism and supporting individuals with substance use disorders and co-occurring \nmental health issues, through a structured, evidence-based approach that integrates \njudicial oversight with intensive treatment, supervision, and accountability measures. \nBIDC operates programs in both Hilo and Kona, and it currently has over 100 participants, \nincluding twenty-five (25) women, engaged in substance use treatment, frequent drug \ntesting, judicial monitoring, group activities, and supportive services designed to promote \nrecovery and long-term stability. \nDue to the success of the BIDC program over the years, the Third Circuit also \nimplemented a Veterans’ Treatment Court program in 2014, as well as a Juvenile \nTreatment Court program. These programs are not standalone courts, but rather distinct \nprograms operated by drug court staff and stationed under the supervision of BIDC. This \nproposal seeks to add a Women’s Court program to the quiver of specialty programming \noffered to probationers in West Hawaiʻi, under the auspices of Kona BIDC. If the pilot \nprogram is successful, the ultimate goal would be to expand the Women’s Court program \nto Hilo and make the program permanent after the end of the 3-year project period.  \nBy leveraging the existing BIDC structure and staff at the outset, the Third Circuit \nwill be able to supplement existing drug court services in Kona with the additional services \nto be provided through this measure—services that justice-involved women on Hawaiʻi \nIsland desperately need. Through a Women’s Court program that is well-tailored to the \nThird Circuit’s unique court structure, and, most importantly, that is responsive to the \nindividual needs of justice-involved women, the Judiciary looks forward to the opportunity \nto participate in this revolutionary pilot project.     \nB. There Is a Need to Develop Critical Resources and Services in West Hawaiʻi. \nDue to the severe shortage of community-based treatment options on Hawaiʻi \nIsland, developing, creating, and sustaining community-wide resources and treatment \ncapacity is critical to ensuring the success of the KWC pilot project. The lack of \ncommunity-based mental health services on the island is particularly severe. In 2023, the \nfinal report of the Adult Mental Health Summit2, held by the Hawaiʻi County Mayor’s Office, \nconcluded that there are serious barriers to accessing mental health services island-wide, \nand that there is a “lack of a comprehensive continuum of care”.3 The group found that in \nHawaiʻi County, there is a “lack of alternatives to hospitalization or encounters with law \nenforcement when someone is experiencing a [mental health] crisis”, with the shortage \nof mental health providers in the community standing as a significant barrier to accessing \n                                                 \n2 The Adult Mental Health Summit included participants from a wide-range of community stakeholders, \nincluding government agencies such as the Department of Health.  \n3 Hawaiʻi County Office of the Mayor (2023). Adult Mental Health Summit August 2023 – Summary \nReport. Retrieved Feb. 11, 2025 from \n<https://www.hawaiicounty.gov/home/showdocument?id=307444&t=638453177631770000>. \n\n \n \n \n3 \n \n2025 Legislative Session                                                         Kona Women’s Court Proposal – Third Circuit \ntreatment.4 The group underscored the pressing need for funding to attract mental health \nprofessionals to Hawaiʻi County and ensure retention.5 \nThis shortage of community-based providers is particularly acute for justice-\ninvolved women, as the few existing providers are often reluctant to take on patients with \njustice-system involvement. The providers who do take on justice-involved clients already \nhave overwhelming caseloads, which hinders their ability to provide timely and consistent \ntreatment. The community-based providers available are also located off-site, creating \npractical challenges for patients who may not have access to reliable transportation or \naccess to the technology needed for telehealth appointments. These providers also have \nestablished practices, and their ability to cater to the specific needs of women may be \nlimited. \nOnly with funding to develop community resources and provide direct services in \nWest Hawaiʻi, will KWC be able to address the individualized needs of women with a \ntrauma-informed and gender-responsive approach. Accordingly, KWC seeks funding to \ndevelop services in the following areas through contracted direct services and training for \nKWC staff:  \n• Timely Screening of At-Risk Women \n• Mental and Behavioral Health Services, Including Psychiatric Care and \nMedication Management \n• Access to Trauma-Informed Therapies that Meet Individual Needs \n• Substance Use Disorder Treatment \n• Peer Support \n• Housing \n• Cultural Activities and Practices \n• Case Management Services \n• Increased Testing and Laboratory Confirmation  \nIn addition to the development of these critical services and treatment options for \nKWC clients, program participants would also have access to established Kona drug court \nresources through available community-based services. These existing services can \nprovide classes, treatment, and support in the areas of domestic violence, including \nsurvivor counseling; education and vocational training; life-skill training, such as financial \nliteracy classes; and family support resources, including parenting classes and \nrelationship improvement resources. KWC probation officers would coordinate referrals \nto these community-based providers based on a risk-needs assessment.  \nThe combination of these existing services with the new, direct services proposed \nherein will ensure that Women’s Court clients are receiving the support they truly require \nin light of their particular backgrounds and needs.     \n                                                 \n4 Id. \n5 Id. \n\n \n \n \n4 \n \n2025 Legislative Session                                                         Kona Women’s Court Proposal – Third Circuit \nC. The Pilot Program Will Focus on West Hawaii’s Most At-Risk Women, While \nOffering Services to Priority 2 Women When Possible.  \nCurrently there are fourteen (14) women participating in the BIDC program in \nKona. These women are considered “Priority 1” clients, meaning they have been \nassessed as having a high risk for recidivism, high rates of substance abuse, and high \nmental health needs. These high-risk women nearly universally have histories of abuse, \ntrauma, poverty, and other risk factors that intersect with their involvement in the criminal \njustice system. Women who have been incarcerated are more likely to report extensive \nhistories of emotional, physical, and sexual abuse, with between 70% and 90% of \nincarcerated women reporting past abuse.6 To illustrate this reality, of the fourteen (14) \nwomen currently in Kona drug court, all have a history of trauma, and (13) thirteen have \na mental health diagnosis. These mental health diagnoses include serious conditions, \nsuch as major depressive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (“PTSD”), bipolar \ndisorder, and borderline personality disorder, which require extensive and careful \ntreatment and management.    \nOn Hawaiʻi Island, women confronted with these challenges face unique barriers \nto treatment and recovery—and not only in the area of mental health services. Hawaiʻi \nCounty is a large, rural county spanning over 4,000 square miles7; many areas of the \nisland are remote and have poor or nonexistent access to critical services, such as public \ntransportation and medical care. Hawaiʻi County also has the highest poverty rate in the \nState at 13.8%, with an average household income of only $68,3998—with the poorest \nareas of the County having a median household income of only $50,313 per year.9  \nHawaiʻi Island also has high rates of domestic violence. Between 2021 and 2023, \nthere was over a 60% increase in the number of participants in programs aimed at the \nprevention of domestic violence.10 Child and Family Services (“CFS”) has reported that \nbetween 2018 and 2020, one domestic violence shelter in Hawaiʻi County served more \nsurvivors than any other CFS shelter in the State.11  \n                                                 \n6 Childhood Trauma and Women’s Health Outcomes in a California Prison Population, PubMed Central \n(Oct. 2006).

West Hawaiʻi Today (Oct. 10, 2023). \nRetrieved on Feb. 11, 2025 from < https://www.westhawaiitoday.com/2023/10/18/hawaii-news/domestic-\nviolence-program-enrollments-spike-on-big-island/>. \n11 Id.  \n\n \n \n \n5 \n \n2025 Legislative Session                                                         Kona Women’s Court Proposal – Third Circuit \nThe problems of domestic violence, poverty, and a lack of access to employment \nopportunities, transportation, and mental health care are issues that disproportionately \nimpact women, who are more likely to be victims of violence and are more likely to have \ndependent children in their care. In consideration of these social realities, closing the \nservice gap for the most at-risk women in West Hawaiʻi is imperative.   \nDue to their risk-factors, all Priority 1 women currently in Kona drug court would be \nassessed and considered for the expanded, gender-responsive and individualized \nservices and programming to be offered through KWC. For the duration of the pilot \nproject, any women referred to BIDC or Veteran’s Treatment Court in Kona would also \nbe assessed for the Women’s Court program. However, due to the acute lack of \ncommunity-based services on the Big Island, especially in the areas of mental health, the \nKWC staff would also seek to provide services to Priority 2 justice-involved women, who \nhave lower risk factors, whenever possible.     \n \nPriority 2 women who would be considered for assistance would be women on \nsupervision with Hawaiʻi Intake Service Center (“HISC”) and women on regular probation \nin Kona who are not high enough risk or otherwise do not meet the eligibility criteria for \nreferral to a treatment court program. These women also experience barriers to treatment \nand lack access to mental health services, including crisis stabilization, which can \ninterfere with successful completion of probation. Currently, there are forty-five (45) \nwomen on supervision with HISC and thirty-seven (37) who are on regular probation \nsupervision in Kona, for a total of eighty-two (82) Priority 2 women who could be assessed \nfor mental health needs. The actual number of Priority 2 women who would be provided \nwith treatment, services, or other interventions, such as trauma treatment, psychiatric \nmedication, housing stabilization, case management, and linkages with other community-\nbased services would be based on the results of individual assessments.  \nWhile the focus of the pilot project is to help the most at-risk women in West \nHawaiʻi, it is anticipated that KWC staff will be able to provide critical services to many of \nthese Priority 2 women, and possibly even to some men, on a case-by-case basis. This \nwill ensure that the program’s investments in direct services are utilized to their maximum \npotential and contribute to positive outcomes for the largest number of women.  \nD. The Program \na. Eligibility Criteria & Disqualifications \nThe Third Circuit’s vision for Women’s Court aims to utilize best practice standards \nfrom the treatment court model to address the needs of Priority 1 women in a gender-\nresponsive format. Because KWC would be built on the foundation of BIDC, there is \nsubstantial overlap between the proposed eligibility criteria and exclusion factors for KWC \nand those of the drug court program.  \nThe current, proposed eligibility criteria and disqualification factors for the KWC \npilot project are as follows: \n1. Proposed Eligibility Criteria: \n• Must be at least eighteen (18) years old; \n\n \n \n \n6 \n \n2025 Legislative Session                                                         Kona Women’s Court Proposal – Third Circuit \n• Must reside in area supervised by Kona probation; \n• Must have a history of or evidence of current substance abuse and/or \nmental health issues; \n• Must be convicted of or on status for a felony offense; \n• Must voluntarily agree to participate in Konaa Women’s Court; and  \n• Must fully participate in the Kona Women’s Court screening process, \nincluding the LSI-R and be assessed as high risk for recidivism and as \nhaving high treatment needs. \n2. Proposed Disqualifications: \n• Convicted of any sex offense that requires or may trigger registration; \n• Convicted of an offense that carries a mandatory prison sentence; \n• Pending charges that would interfere with treatment court participation; \n• Convicted of any previous or pending Class A felony; \n• Convicted of a drug trafficking offense within the last ten (10) years; \n• Is working as a confidential informant; \n• Has been determined by the Kona Women’s Court team to suffer from \na mental illness or developmental disability that will not allow the \ndefendant to complete the program requirements, but only when it is \nalso determined that the defendant cannot be stabilized with the \nresources and services available; or \n• Is presently on status for any violent offense, defined as: \ni. Offenses that involve the discharge of a firearm or threat of harm \nwith firearm; \nii. Any offense that involves death or that results in great bodily \nharm to the victim; \niii. Class B felony violent offenses (other than sexual offenses \ncovered above).  \nConsistent with treatment court best practices, the eligibility criteria of BIDC is \nrevised periodically to ensure that criteria are in line with current evidence and best \npractices. The eligibility criteria for KWC will also be subject to this periodic revision, to \nensure that the program is meeting the needs of the target population. As such, the \nforegoing proposed eligibility criteria and exclusion factors are likely to change over time, \nespecially if the pilot project is extended beyond the current 3-year proposal.  \nb. Referral & Screening Process \n\n \n \n \n7 \n \n2025 Legislative Session                                                         Kona Women’s Court Proposal – Third Circuit \nThe KWC will accept referrals of women to the program in the same way that \nreferrals are currently made to Kona’s BIDC and Veteran’s Treatment Court programs. \nThese referrals are made by judges after defendants have been convicted of a crime, and \nwhile they are pending sentencing. The screening process will utilize best practices, \nincluding the Level of Service Inventory-Revised (“LSI-R”) assessment tool, which is a \nstandardized, evidence-based assessment tool widely used to identify an offender’s risk \nof reoffending and to inform treatment and supervision plans. Because the Third Circuit’s \nWomen’s Court structure would situate KWC under the supervision of BIDC, all women \nreferred to Kona BIDC or Veteran’s Treatment Court would also be automatically \nscreened for eligibility for the KWC program. This allows for maximum flexibility and \ntreatment options for high-risk women.  \nFor example, if a woman is a veteran who would benefit from Veteran’s Court \nprogramming, upon referral to Kona Veteran’s Court, she would also be assessed for \nKWC eligibility automatically, without the need for an additional referral. If her risk-needs \nassessment shows she would also benefit from the services and programming of KWC, \nthe proposed structure of KWC would allow such a woman to take full advantage of both \nprograms simultaneously and seamlessly, without needing to choose one or the other.   \nc. Court Sessions & Program Activities \nAs with other treatment courts, and consistent with treatment court best practices, \nKWC would hold court sessions with the judge and other members of the Women’s Court \nteam, where all women admitted to the program would participate approximately twice \nper month. Along with group court hearings, KWC would provide group activities, \nincluding group therapy, cultural activities, and peer mentorship and support on a regular \nbasis. Group sessions with the judge, as well as group programming, are essential to \nbuilding trust in the program and in the justice system. Group programming also builds \ncamaraderie and prosocial bonds between participants. These activities are also integral \nto fostering a safe, women-only environment where women can feel secure and \ncomfortable sharing openly with their peers and program staff.  \nd. Cultural Component \nBest practices dictate that culturally responsive evaluation and treatment planning \nare essential to successful treatment and recovery.12 It is vital that the programming \noffered by KWC is culturally sensitive and relevant to the needs of the women in the \nprogram. Over 44% of incarcerated women in Hawaiʻi are Native Hawaiian, despite \nmaking up only 19.8% of the state’s total female population.13 Therefore, the KWC \n                                                 \n12 See Improving Cultural Competence.

OHA Fact Sheet. Retrieved on Feb. 11, \n2025 from <https://www.oha.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/factsheets_final_web_0.pdf>. \n\n \n \n \n8 \n \n2025 Legislative Session                                                         Kona Women’s Court Proposal – Third Circuit \nenvisions working with Cultural Advisors to make sure that goals and program content \nare culturally relevant to maximize the benefit of the program to Native Hawaiian women \nand women from other marginalized groups.  \n   The Cultural Advisors selected will be well versed in dealing with multicultural \ngroups of women who come from a variety of backgrounds. They will employ values \nuniversal to most (if not all) cultures, presented in a Hawaiian way. No particular religion \nwill be forced, and the Cultural Advisors and KWC team will be as sensitive to as possible \nto all cultural groups.  \nE. Program Evaluation \nBesides Hawaiʻi, there are only a few other jurisdictions in the country that have \nbegun Women’s Court programs. As such, there are no established best practices for \nWomen’s Court programs. The KWC team will therefore need to thoughtfully implement \ncurrent treatment court best practices in the development of the program, such as the use \nof treatment interventions specific to women’s issues, including treatment for PTSD and \ntrauma. Because of the relatively novel nature of this trailblazing project, the program \nevaluation component will be extremely important and will involve careful study.  \nIt is anticipated that an outside researcher may be invited to do a study on the \nKWC and assist with program evaluation, due to the impacts this program may have on \nnational best practice standards. As such, the proposed budget included herein includes \nan amount for program evaluation.   \nF. Other Services \nWhile the focus of the KWC pilot project will be on developing a comprehensive \nWomen’s Court Program for Priority 1 women in West Hawaiʻi, the hope is that the \ninjection of funding and development of community-based resources through this \nprogram will benefit other justice-involved individuals, such as Priority 2 women—\nespecially those needing critical mental health services. These “extracurricular” services \nwould be offered on a case-by-case basis when determined appropriate by the KWC \nteam, and only when doing so would not detract from the services needed for Priority 1 \nwomen in the KWC program.  \nAllowing the flexibility of providing services to individuals outside the KWC program \nwill ensure that the resources furnished through this pilot project are being utilized to their \nmaximum potential and can be adapted for a variety of individual cases and \ncircumstances.    \nIII. \nThe Court’s Structure & Proposed Budget \nA. The Team \nBecause the KWC pilot project will use the pre-existing staff and structures of the \nBIDC program to address the needs of women already participating in drug court, the \nKWC team will consist of the dedicated team of BIDC probation officers and staff, as well \nas specially trained professionals in direct service provider positions. Due to the lack of \n\n \n \n \n9 \n \n2025 Legislative Session                                                         Kona Women’s Court Proposal – Third Circuit \ncommunity-based service providers on the Big Island, discussed in detail above, funding \nsufficient to recruit and retain full-time mental health professionals, as well as funding for \nadequate training of program staff, are absolutely imperative to the success of the pilot \nproject. Only through the development of new services will the KWC be able to guarantee \nthat women in the program will have both access to necessary services and consistency \nof treatment.  \nTherefore, this proposal seeks funding for the following service provider positions \nand services: \n1. Women’s Mental Health Professional (1FTE) (POS Contractor(s)): KWC \nwould seek to hire a Women’s Mental Health Professional. This mental health \nprofessional would have a full-time equivalent (“FTE”) position and would be \nassigned to the Keahuolū courthouse, to enable them to provide consistent and \ntimely mental and behavioral health services. This mental health professional \nwould ensure timely screening of at-risk women, including at the jail, at the \ncourthouse, or in the community, and they would be able to provide treatment \ndirectly, including treatment for trauma, substance use disorder, and mental \nhealth issues specific to women. They would also be available to help stabilize \njustice-involved women, so that the legal process can take place and \ncommunity-based treatments can begin. Additionally, this professional would \nbe able to offer medication assisted treatment and a variety of therapies, \nincluding behavioral therapies, group therapy, and more. Having a dedicated, \nfull-time Women’s Mental Health Professional to provide direct services and \nassist clients with referrals and connections with longer-term treatment, crisis \nstabilization, case management, Department of Health services, and other \ncommunity mental health resources is critical to ensuring continuity of care for \nwomen in the program.  \n2. Women’s Behavioral Health Beds (POS Contractor(s)): To facilitate \neffective treatment, recovery, and case management, it is essential to have \nbeds available in facilities that will provide support staff to address substance \nuse issues and facilitate mental health treatment, including crisis stabilization \nand medication compliance. Currently there are no dual-diagnosis beds \navailable to probationers in the Third Circuit. Funding for behavioral health beds \nwould ensure that the highest-risk women have access to secure, women-only \nhousing where they can receive support for all of their needs. With the funds \nrequested in the proposed budget outlined below, it is anticipated that one of \nthe service providers already contracted to provide bedspaces to Kona drug \ncourt clients will be able to dedicate a house specifically for women in KWC—\nwith anywhere from three (3) to six (6) bedspaces being reserved for KWC’s \nexclusive use at any given time.  \n3. Cultural Practitioner(s) & Advisor(s) (POS Contractor(s)): Best practices \nhave long dictated that culturally responsive and culturally relevant evaluation, \nobjectives, and treatment result in better outcomes for individuals receiving \nsubstance abuse and mental health treatment. KWC would utilize Cultural \n\n \n \n \n10 \n \n2025 Legislative Session                                                         Kona Women’s Court Proposal – Third Circuit \nAdvisors to run cultural activities and group sessions. Cultural Advisors would \nalso assist the KWC team to ensure treatment goals and methods are culturally \nrelevant, and that individual treatment plans and the services provided by the \nprogram are sensitive to participants’ backgrounds, beliefs, and practices, to \nthe extent possible.  \n4. Drug Court Peer Specialist(s) (1FTE) (POS Contractor(s)): Mentorship \nplays a vital role in substance abuse treatment, because it provides a crucial \nlayer of support, accountability, and shared experience for individuals in \naddiction recovery. While mentorship is considered a best practice in \nsubstance abuse treatment, it is particularly critical for women to have access \nto effective mentorship, as studies have shown that women are less \ncomfortable talking about substance use than their male counterparts, and less \nlikely to seek help or treatment.14 KWC would hire former female drug court \ngraduates in peer support roles to ensure that participants in the program \nreceive mentorship that is responsive to the unique needs of women.  \nIn addition to these essential positions, KWC will also seek funding for a Probation \nSupervisor position, as well as for funding for training of KWC staff. \n5. Kona Probation Supervisor (1FTE) (Judiciary Staff): Additional staffing \nwithin the probation division will be necessary to manage and implement KWC \ndeliverables for program participants. There is already an existing gap in Kona \nprobation, where the BIDC probation officers currently lack a supervisor. In all \nother probation divisions there is supervisor position for every 3-4 probation \nofficers. The added supervision and administrative burdens of an additional \ntreatment court program will necessitate that this gap in staffing be addressed.  \n6. KWC Staff Training: Within the first year of the pilot project, KWC would seek \nto have its team members participate in available local and online trainings. In \nyear two (2) of the program, the Kona team, consisting of up to fifteen (15) team \nmembers15, would travel to the national All Rise conference. All Rise is the \nnational organization for training in the treatment court model16, and it is the \nauthor of the Adult Treatment Court Best Practice Standards—considered the \ngold standard for treatment courts nationally. Training and conference \n                                                 \n14 See Women’s barriers to specialty substance abuse treatment: A qualitative exploration of racial/ethnic \ndifferences. PubMed Central (Aug. 2021). Retrieved on Feb. 13, 2025 from \n<https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7075735/>. \n15 Teams would include the KWC probation officers, probation supervisor, assigned judge, service \nproviders, and, funding permitted, the assigned Deputy Public Defender, Deputy Prosecuting Attorney, \nand Hawaiʻi Police Department Officer.   \n16 All Rise began 30 years ago as the National Association of Drug Court Professionals. In 2023, the \norganization rebranded as “All Rise” to reflect the organization’s focus on all treatment courts, including \nFamily Treatment Court, DUI Court, Juvenile Treatment Court, and others.  \n\n \n \n \n11 \n \n2025 Legislative Session                                                         Kona Women’s Court Proposal – Third Circuit \nattendance is essential to ensure that the KWC program is implementing \ntreatment court best practices, based on the most current evidence available. \nAdditionally, as Hawaiʻi is one of the first states in the nation to implement a \nWomen’s Court program, conference attendance will provide significant \nopportunities to spread the Women’s Court model to other jurisdictions.    \nFinally, the KWC program would seek to contract with vendors and providers to \nprovide access to Moral Reconation Therapy (“MRT”) and increased drug testing and \ngreater laboratory confirmation capacities. KWC is also seeking funding for technology to \nsupport program operations, including computer workstations, so that program \nparticipants can have reliable internet access. \n7. Moral Reconation Therapy & Training (Contracted): KWC will seek to \ncontract with therapists who can provide MRT group sessions to program \nparticipants and train KWC staff in the MRT methodology. MRT is a cognitive \nbehavioral therapy designed to address severe criminal thinking. It is effective \nin treating substance abuse, trauma, patterns of domestic violence, and other \nissues that intersect with women’s involvement in criminal behavior. Studies \nhave shown that offenders who receive MRT are far less likely to be re-arrested \nor re-incarcerated. One study that tracked nearly 1,400 participants over 20 \nyears found that the use of MRT reduced the likelihood of an offender being re-\nincarcerated by nearly 30%.17  By training the KWC staff in MRT, the program \ncan build the capacity to sustainably provide justice-involved women with the \ntools needed to change their thought processes, make better decisions, and \nultimately reduce recidivism.  \n8. Increased Drug Testing & Greater Laboratory Confirmation Capabilities \n(Vendors): Funding for increased capacity and effectiveness of drug testing \nand laboratory confirmation will be essential to monitoring the compliance of \nwomen in the KWC program and ensuring effectiveness of treatment. With the \nintegration of critical mental health services and treatment through the pilot \nproject, program staff will need the ability to confirm compliance with psychiatric \nand other prescribed medication through laboratory testing. The use of sweat \npatches and Smartstart technology for KWC will also ensure that participants \ncan be adequately monitored for compliance with drug and alcohol conditions \nwhile in the community, when standard urine testing is not practical. For \nexample, if a client needs to travel the mainland for medical treatment, currently \n                                                 \n17 20-year study finds MRT Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy reduces re-arrests and re-incarceration.

With a sweat \npatch, the client’s probation officer would be able to verify compliance. \n9. Technology: As set forth in the proposed program budget below, funding is \nbeing sought for technology to support program operations, including \ncomputers for additional staff, as well as a computer workstation in the Kona \nprobation waiting area. This workstation would be available for clients to use \nfor job applications and searches, applications to educational and training \nprograms, housing applications, and similar, essential administrative tasks. \nMany justice-involved women in our rural community lack reliable access to the \ninternet at home. Internet access is required to do the most basic of tasks in \nour modern, digital world. Having computers available so that program \nparticipants have guaranteed access to the internet every time they come to \ncourt would be a significant step to closing this digital divide.   \nB. 3-Year Pilot Program Budget \n \nThree-Year Pilot Program Budget: \n \n \nBreakdown of Estimated Training Costs: \n \n \nYear 1\nYear 2\nYear 3\nServices\nAnnual Cost\nAnnual Cost\nAnnual Cost\nn\nTotal Cost\nWomen's Mental Health Professional (1FTE)\n175,000.00\n$           \n175,000.00\n$           \n175,000.00\n$           \n525,000.00\n$           \nWomens Behavioral  Health Beds\n100,000.00\n$           \n100,000.00\n$           \n100,000.00\n$           \n300,000.00\n$           \nKona Drug Court  Probation Supervisor (1FTE)\n85,000.00\n$             \n85,000.00\n$             \n85,000.00\n$             \n255,000.00\n$           \nCultural Practitioner and Advisor\n30,000.00\n$             \n30,000.00\n$             \n30,000.00\n$             \n90,000.00\n$             \nPeer Specialist (1FTE)\n80,000.00\n$             \n80,000.00\n$             \n80,000.00\n$             \n240,000.00\n$           \nMoral Reconation Therapy\n25,000.00\n$             \n25,000.00\n$             \n25,000.00\n$             \n75,000.00\n$             \nIncreased Drug Testing/Lab confirmation\n10,000.00\n$             \n10,000.00\n$             \n10,000.00\n$             \n30,000.00\n$             \nTraining\n5,000.00\n$                \n42,000.00\n$             \n-\n$                          \n47,000.00\n$             \nTechnology\n4,900.00\n$                \n-\n$                          \n-\n$                          \n4,900.00\n$                \nProgram Evaluation\n-\n$                          \n-\n$                          \n10,000.00\n$             \n10,000.00\n$             \nTotal\n514,900.00\n$           \n547,000.00\n$           \n515,000.00\n$           \n1,576,900.00\n$       \nTraining:\nCost\nYear 1:  Local and Other Trainings\n$5,000\nYear 2:  Kona Team : All Rise National Conference \n(Washington DC)\n42,000.00\n$          \nTotal Training Cost:\n$47,000\n\n \n \n \n13 \n \n2025 Legislative Session                                                         Kona Women’s Court Proposal – Third Circuit \n \nBreakdown of Estimated Technology Costs: \n \n \nTechnology:\nKona Cost\nComputer Workstation (in Probation Waiting A\n1,200.00\n$           \nComputer for Kona Probation Supervisor\n1,000.00\n$           \nPrinter for Kona Probation Supervisor\n1,000.00\n$           \nCellphone for Field Work Kona Prob .

This \nbill would, inter alia, make the Mohala Wahine program in the First Circuit permanent, establish \na three-year women’s court pilot program in the Third Circuit Kona division, and require the \nJudiciary to submit a report to the legislature regarding the need for and associated costs of a \npilot program for women’s court in the Second and Fifth Circuits as well as the Hilo division of \nthe Third Circuit. \n \n \nThe Department of the Prosecuting Attorney, County of Maui supports this bill because \nin addition to making the Mohala Wahine program permanent, it would provide a needed \nalternative to incarceration for women within the Third Circuit, particularly women with a high \nrisk of recidivism and in need of services in addition to existing substance abuse and mental \nhealth treatment programs. We also support the program’s use of trauma-informed and evidence-\nbased practices. Finally, we support exploring the possibility that a similar program to the \nMohala Wahine program in the First Circuit could be established in the Second and Fifth \nCircuits, as well as the Hilo division of the Third Circuit. \n \n \nFor these reasons, the Department of the Prosecuting Attorney, County of Maui supports \nH.B. 727 HD1 SD1.

The League believes that \nevidence-based programs can reduce recidivism and provide a path to stable, \nsuccessful reintegration in the community for women who have suffered a criminal \nconviction. Such programs are also fiscally responsible, as supportive services are far \nless costly than incarceration when a person reoffends.  \n \nWhen women get support dealing with addiction, abuse, and poverty through evidence-\nbased programs, education, and training it benefits their children and families, \nneighbors, and the Hawai’i community at large. With this bill the lessons learned in the \nfirst district can be applied to bring successful outcomes to a larger number of women, \nfor the good of all.  \n \nThank you for the opportunity to submit testimony in support of HB 727 SD1 \n\n \n \nHB727 HD1 SD1 Women’s Court \nCOMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS \nSenator Donovan M. Dela Cruz, Chair \nSenator Sharon Y. Moriwaki, Vice Chair \nWednesday, Mar 31, 2025: 10:02: Room 211 Videoconference \n \n \n \nHawaii Substance Abuse Coalition Supports HB727 HD1 SD1: \n \nALOHA CHAIR, VICE CHAIR, AND DISTINGUISHED COMMITTEE MEMBERS. My \nname is Alan Johnson. I am the current chair of the Hawaii Substance Abuse Coalition \n(HSAC), a statewide organization for substance use disorder and co-occurring mental \nhealth disorder treatment and prevention agencies and recovery-oriented services. \n \n \nHSAC supports a 3-year pilot program the Kona division of the Third under the Big \nIsland Drug Court for a gender responsive approach to women who are justice-\ninvolved. \n \nRecovery can be complex because recovery involves a multitude of issues such as \ntrauma, substance use disorder, mental illness, unhealthy relationships, domestic \nviolence, sexual assault, and family law disputes. Courts can ensure a collaboration \nwith multiple providers to implement evidenced-based behavioral health practices to \nsupport their full recovery and not return to incarceration.   \nFormal substance abuse with mental illness treatment, \nsuch as residential and intensive outpatient, is still the \nmost effective approach to achieve functionality and \nlasting recovery for justice-involved women.  \n \nSubstance use disorder coupled with mental health treatment is essential for \noffenders because it addresses the underlying issues that often contribute to criminal \nbehavior and helps break the cycle of addiction and recidivism. Gender-responsive \nwomen’s courts are effective because they address the unique needs and challenges \nwomen face: \n \n1. Trauma-Informed Approach. Women’s courts often adopt trauma-\ninformed practices, ensuring that the court process is sensitive to the \n\nemotional, psychological, and physical impact of trauma on survivors. This \nfosters an environment where women feel safe, heard, and respected. \n  \n2. High Rates of Substance Abuse Among Offenders: Many offenders \nstruggle with substance use disorders. Studies show that a significant \nproportion of crimes, including theft, assault, and drug-related offenses, are \ncommitted under the influence of drugs or alcohol. \n \n3. Addresses Root Causes of Criminal Behavior: Substance abuse often \ncoexists with mental health issues, trauma, or socioeconomic challenges. \nTreatment programs can provide a comprehensive approach to addressing \nthese interconnected factors. Treating substance abuse can lower the \nlikelihood of reoffending. Offenders who receive effective treatment are more \nlikely to develop coping skills and lead crime-free lives after release. \n \n4. Specialized Training for Judges and Staff: Judges, attorneys, and court \nstaff in women’s courts typically receive specialized training in gender \ndynamics, domestic violence, and trauma. This equips them to make \ninformed, fair decisions and avoid perpetuating biases or re-traumatizing \nsurvivors. \n \n5. Integrated Social Services: Women’s courts often partner with social \nservices, offering survivors access to counseling, housing assistance, legal aid, \nchildcare, and job training. This holistic approach addresses the underlying \nissues that women face, helping them rebuild their lives. \n \n6. Empowering Women: By creating a supportive and understanding \nenvironment, women’s courts help survivors regain confidence, independence, \nand control over their lives, encouraging long-term recovery and stability \nwhile simultaneously holding perpetrators accountable while ensuring victim \nsafety. \n \nThis focused approach ensures that justice-involved women are given an opportunity \nto rebuild their lives, contributing positively to society rather than being trapped in \ncycles of crime and incarceration. \n \nWe appreciate the opportunity to provide testimony and are available for questions. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCOMMUNITY ALLIANCE ON PRISONS \nP.O.

This testimony is respectfully offered on behalf of the 3,767 Hawai`i \nindividuals living behind bars1 and under the “care and custody” of the Department of \nCorrections and Rehabilitation as of March 24, 2025. We are always mindful that 936 \npersons – 49.5% - of Hawai`i’s male prison population (1,890) are serving their sentences \nabroad -- thousands of miles away from their loved ones, their homes and, for the \ndisproportionate number of incarcerated Kanaka Maoli, far, far from their ancestral \nlands. \n \nIn Hawai`i nei, women comprise  11% of the entire jail  and prison \npopulation with 99 women in our 4 jails and 303 women at WCCC.  \n \nMahalo for the opportunity to show our strong support for HB 727 HD1, SD1 that \nmakes permanent, the Mohala Wahine Women’s Court Project in the First Circuit and \nestablishes a three—year Women's Court Pilot Program in the circuit court of the Kona \ndivision of the Third Circuit under the supervision of the Big Island Drug Court and \nrequiring a report to the legislature. \n \nThe Women’s Court in the First Circuit acknowledges that women’s pathways to \nincarceration are different and need gender responsive programs to address the many \nissues they have experienced in their journeys thus far. We are, therefore, happy to see \ntrauma-informed care and gender-responsivity being the focus for this court. \n \n \n1 DCR Weekly Population Report, March 24, 2025 \nhttps://dcr.hawaii.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Pop-Reports-Weekly-2025-03-24.pdf \n \n\nJudge Kim from Hawai`i Island has been at hearings helping O`ahu legislators \nunderstand the resource challenges of our neighbor islands. We know we don’t have \nenough programs and services on O`ahu; this is magnified on our outer islands.  \n \nCommunity Alliance on Prisons commends Judge Kim for his belief that we can \ndo more and his willingness to find ways to better serve the people on our outer islands!  \nImua, Judge Kim! \n \nWe hope that WAM funds this important effort and that Hawai`i will substantially \nreduce our current population of incarcerated women. This will help our communities \nand families. WE CAN DO THIS! \n \n \nMahalo nui! \n \n\nHB-727-SD-1 \nSubmitted on: 3/31/2025 7:37:09 AM \nTestimony for WAM on 3/31/2025 10:02:00 AM \nSubmitted By \nOrganization \nTestifier Position \nTestify \nLydia Leanos \nIndividual \nSupport \nWritten Testimony \nOnly \n \n \nComments:  \nI am strongly in support of HB 727, Women's Court Pilot Program. I feel that this type of court \nprogram is a strong step towards a trauma informed system that support members of our \ncommunity that need supports towards reintegration into society and a court system that views \npeople as people, not just criminals. The women's court program has the potential to see people \nas what has happened to them, not what is wrong with them, which is a framework that moves \nour entire judicial system towards restorative justice and not just further incarceration. Like the \nJuvenile Girls Court program, which is a successful model of treatment and intervention, I am in \nfavor of HB 727 and a Women's court Program for the women of Hawaii.  \n \n \u0010\u0005\u0018\t\n"
