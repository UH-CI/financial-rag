  "overview": "HB727 proposes to make the existing Women's Court pilot program in the First Circuit permanent, establish a new three-year pilot program in the Kona Division of the Third Circuit Court, and mandates a legislative report assessing the feasibility and costs of expanding Women's Courts to the Second, Fifth, and Hilo (Third Circuit) Circuits.  The Department of Health supports the measure, requesting funding for expanded services and staff support contingent on it not supplanting existing budget requests.  No specific funding amounts or sunset clauses are detailed in the provided testimony.",
  "policy_impact": "This measure proposes a three-year pilot program for a Women's Court in the Second and Fifth Circuit Courts,  mandating a concurrent study by the Third Circuit and Big Island Drug Court to develop a blueprint for a similar program in the Third Circuit.  The policy modifies existing court structures by introducing a specialized court focused on trauma-informed and evidence-based practices for women, potentially aligning with broader state legislative strategies aimed at improving the justice system's response to gender-specific needs.  The success of this pilot program could influence future statewide expansion of Women's Courts, impacting state governance through changes in judicial processes and resource allocation.",
  "appropriations": "Based on the provided documents,  HB 1045, HD1 makes emergency appropriations for fiscal year 2024-2025 to the Department of Accounting and General Services and the Judiciary.  The specific amount appropriated is not detailed in the provided text. The intended use is for payroll and fringe benefits of affected Department of Law Enforcement personnel.  Further details regarding the exact allocation between the two departments and the total sum are unavailable in the provided documents.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The cost projections for HB727, HD1, totaling $1,071,900, are based on estimated personnel costs (e.g., $160,000 for a Peer Specialist FTE, $50,000 for Moral Reconation Therapy),  programmatic expenses (e.g., $20,000 for increased drug testing), and technology upgrades ($4,900).  These figures appear to represent a combination of one-time and recurring costs, but the specific breakdown between these categories is not explicitly provided in the available documentation.  No comparable programs or historical budget data are referenced to support these cost estimates.",
  "agency_impact": "The Department of Health (DOH) supports this measure, requesting funding to expand services and staff support contingent on it not replacing funding already requested in the Governor's executive budget.  The measure's implementation will require additional resource allocation for the Adult Mental Health Division,  specifically for staffing and operational costs associated with expanding services.  The exact budgetary impact remains unspecified pending further details and the finalization of the Governor's budget.",
  "economic_impact": "The provided documents state that the Department of Health supports the measure to establish a three-year Women\u2019s Court pilot program in the second and fifth circuits, and an interim study for a third circuit program.  The economic impact is expected to involve expanded services and staff support, contingent upon not supplanting the Governor's executive budget request.  Specific cost savings, reductions in related expenditures, or community benefits (e.g., reduced recidivism, improved health outcomes) are not quantified in the provided testimony.  Further information is needed to provide a complete economic impact analysis.",
  "revenue_sources": "The provided documents state that the Department of Health requests funding for the proposed measure.  However, the specific funding source is not identified.  The request stipulates that the funding should be considered as a means to expand services and should not supplant existing requests within the Governor's executive budget.  Therefore, the revenue source is currently undetermined and requires further clarification from the Governor's executive budget proposal.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "Six-Year Fiscal Implications: HB727 (Women's Court Pilot Program)\n\nThe provided documents offer insufficient data to generate a complete six-year fiscal projection for HB727.  The testimonies consistently state that the Department of Health requests funding to be considered for service expansion, including staff support, contingent on not supplanting the Governor's executive budget request.  However, no specific dollar amounts, staffing numbers, or projected costs are provided for the three-year Women's Court pilot program in the second and fifth circuits, nor for the subsequent study to establish a blueprint for a third-circuit program.  \n\nTherefore, a detailed six-year projection is impossible without additional information.  To create a comprehensive fiscal note, the following data are critically needed:\n\n* **Initial Costs (Years 1-3):**  Specific budget requirements for establishing and operating the pilot programs in the second and fifth circuits (personnel costs, operational expenses, facility needs, etc.).  This should include a breakdown of costs for each circuit.\n* **Interim Study Costs (Year 3):**  Detailed budget for the Judiciary's study to create a blueprint for a third-circuit program.\n* **Potential Expansion Costs (Years 4-6):**  Projected costs for expanding the program beyond the initial three-year pilot phase, contingent on the study's findings and legislative decisions. This should include assumptions about program permanence and potential expansion to other circuits.\n* **Recurring Annual Costs (Years 4-6):**  Estimated annual operating costs once the program is fully implemented, including staffing levels and associated salaries, benefits, and operational expenses.\n* **Assumptions:**  Clearly stated assumptions regarding program expansion, legislative appropriations, and potential changes in workload or service delivery models.\n\nWithout this information, any six-year fiscal projection would be purely speculative and unreliable for informed decision-making.  The current documentation only indicates a request for funding to support expansion without quantifiable details.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "The provided documents offer insufficient information to project ongoing fiscal obligations for the women's court pilot program beyond the initial two-year (FY2025-2026 and FY2026-2027) appropriation.  The documents detail the creation of several temporary FTE positions (social workers, clerks, and a clinical psychologist) within the Judiciary, but do not specify whether these positions are intended to be permanent after the pilot program concludes, nor do they provide salary information or projected annual operating costs beyond the initial two years.  Therefore, any estimation of the program's long-term sustainability and annual costs after six years is impossible without additional budgetary information and a clear statement of the program's intended lifespan and funding mechanism.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The provided documents do not contain information on anticipated impacts on operating revenues resulting from the proposed program (establishment of a three-year Women\u2019s Court pilot program).  The testimonies focus on the Department of Health's request for funding to expand services and explicitly state that the funding should not supplant existing budget requests.  Therefore, no changes to existing revenue streams are projected based on the available information.  Further analysis would require access to the Governor's executive budget request and a detailed cost-benefit analysis of the proposed Women's Court program to determine any potential indirect impacts on state operating revenues.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The provided documents, specifically focusing on HB727, HD1,  do not contain information regarding capital expenditures for facilities, equipment, or technology infrastructure related to the women's court pilot program.  The fiscal note's  `capital_expenditure_impact` section would therefore state that no capital expenditures are anticipated based on the available information in HB727, HD1.  Further information from capital budgets or agency plans is required to assess potential capital expenditure needs.",
