  "overview": "HB727, as amended, makes the Women's Court Pilot Program in the First Circuit permanent, establishes a three-year Women's Court pilot program in the Kona division of the Third Circuit, and mandates a Judiciary report to the legislature on the feasibility and costs of expanding Women's Court to the Second, Fifth, and Hilo divisions of the Third Circuit.  The measure includes funding requests for staff support and services for the pilot programs, contingent on not supplanting the Governor's executive budget request.  The Kona pilot program will sunset on June 30, 2027, requiring a report to the legislature on its findings and recommendations by forty days prior to the convening of the regular sessions of 2026, 2027, and 2028.",
  "policy_impact": "HB727, HD1, SD2 modifies existing laws by establishing a permanent Women's Court Program in the First Circuit and a two-year pilot program in the Kona division of the Third Circuit.  This measure aligns with broader legislative strategies aimed at improving the justice system's response to women involved in the legal system by implementing trauma-informed and evidence-based practices.  The potential effects on state governance include increased demands on the Judiciary's budget ($514,900 for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027 are appropriated, specifically for mental health, substance abuse treatment, other services, and one new FTE position),  requiring the Judiciary to submit reports on the program's effectiveness to the legislature in 2026, 2027, and 2028, and potentially influencing future legislation based on these findings.",
  "appropriations": "HB727, relating to the Women's Court, includes appropriations for the expansion of the Women's Court pilot program.  Specifically, $514,900 is appropriated for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027 for the Kona division of the Third Circuit.  These funds are intended for mental health and substance abuse treatment services, other services, equipment, and the establishment of one full-time equivalent temporary Kona drug court probation supervisor position.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The financial projections for the Women's Court Pilot Program in the Kona division of the Third Circuit are based on estimated personnel costs for 1.0 FTE Clinical Psychologist ($145,000), 1.0 FTE Social Worker/Human Services Professional IV ($76,788), and 1.0 FTE Social Services Assistant V ($45,216),  as detailed in Document 3.  Additional costs include $514,900 for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027 for mental health, substance abuse treatment, other services, and equipment (Document 21). These figures are derived from departmental budget requests and reflect staffing requirements for a similar existing program in the First Circuit (Document 3).",
  "agency_impact": "The proposed measure anticipates operational impacts on the Judiciary and Department of Health.  The Judiciary will experience increased workload and staffing needs, specifically requiring the establishment of temporary positions to support the Women's Court pilot program in the Kona division of the Third Circuit (one full-time equivalent temporary Kona drug court probation supervisor position) and potentially additional positions in other circuits pending further study and legislative action.  The Department of Health will require funding for mental health, substance abuse treatment, and other services, totaling $514,900 for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027,  as well as potential additional funding for staff support contingent upon the final number of positions approved.",
  "economic_impact": "The proposed Women's Court pilot program aims to reduce recidivism and improve community outcomes by diverting women from incarceration and providing them with trauma-informed and evidence-based services.  While specific cost savings or reductions in related expenditures are not detailed in the provided documents, the program anticipates positive community benefits through improved mental health, family support, life skills training, and reduced reliance on incarceration.  The program's success will be measured by tracking participation statistics, including the number of women accepted, completing the program, and recidivism rates, as detailed in the required Judiciary reports to the legislature.",
  "revenue_sources": "The primary funding source for the Women's Court pilot program, as detailed in HB727, CD1, is the general revenues of the State of Hawaii.  Specifically, $514,900 is appropriated for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027.  These funds are designated for mental health services, substance abuse treatment, other services and equipment, and the establishment of a temporary Kona drug court probation supervisor position.  No other revenue streams are identified in the provided documents.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The provided documents offer insufficient information to create a complete six-year fiscal outlook for the Women's Court pilot program.  While several documents detail appropriations for fiscal years 2025-2026 and 2026-2027,  no projections extend beyond 2027.  Specifically, Document 10 shows an appropriation of $514,900 for FY2025-2026 and $557,000 for FY2026-2027 for the Kona division pilot program, including one full-time equivalent (FTE) temporary Kona drug court probation supervisor position.  Other documents mention additional FTE positions (social workers, clerks, psychologists) but lack associated cost figures.  The program's future beyond the initial two-year pilot phase (Document 11) is uncertain, with options including continuation, expansion, or discontinuation (Document 28).  Therefore,  recurring expenses beyond FY2026-2027,  staffing changes after the initial temporary positions expire, and assumptions about program expansion or permanence cannot be reliably projected without further budgetary and workload data.  The absence of detailed cost breakdowns for each FTE position and the lack of long-term planning documents prevent a comprehensive six-year fiscal projection.  A more complete fiscal note would require additional information on projected caseloads, service utilization rates, and potential funding sources beyond the initial appropriations.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "After June 30, 2027, the ongoing fiscal obligations for the Women's Court Pilot Program in Kona are unclear.  The provided documents detail funding only through fiscal year 2026-2027, with the program's Part III explicitly repealed on that date.  No information is available regarding annual operating costs, the number of program sites or units beyond the initial two-year pilot, or the source of funding for any potential continuation of the program after the sunset provision.",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The provided documents do not contain information regarding any anticipated impacts on operating revenues for the Hawaii state government resulting from the proposed Women's Court program (HB727).  The documents focus on appropriations and funding requests for the program's establishment and operation, specifically mentioning  $514,900 for fiscal year 2025-2026 and $557,000 for fiscal year 2026-2027 for related services and personnel.  No changes to existing revenue streams are discussed.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "The provided documents focus on personnel costs (salaries for psychologists, social workers, and assistants) and program funding for the Women's Court pilot program.  There is no mention of capital expenditures such as investments in facilities, equipment, or technology infrastructure.  Therefore, the expected capital expenditure related to this program is zero, based on the available information.  Further information regarding potential facility upgrades, technology needs, or equipment purchases for the Women's Court is needed to accurately assess capital expenditure impacts.",
