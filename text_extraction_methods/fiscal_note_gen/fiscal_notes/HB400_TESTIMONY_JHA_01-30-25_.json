  "overview": "House Bill 400 appropriates funds for the Judiciary's 2025-2027 biennium, focusing on making three specialty courts permanent, fully staffing the new Wahiawā District Court, adding a judge and staff in Kona, addressing cybersecurity, funding the Criminal Justice Research Institute (CJRI), and restoring pandemic-related budget cuts.  The bill includes both operating and capital improvement requests, reflecting the Judiciary's resource needs. Key components include funding for specific programs (Women's Court, Truancy Court, DWI Court) and infrastructure improvements.",
  "appropriations": "The Judiciary requests $6.17 million in FY 2026 and $6.25 million in FY 2027 in additional operating funds, along with $11.9 million in bond funds for capital improvement projects in FY 2026.  Operating requests detail funding for staffing increases (17.0 permanent and 1.0 temporary FTEs), technology upgrades, and program expansions. The capital requests include funds for a new South Kohala District Courthouse, A/C replacement, and addressing building issues statewide.",
  "assumptions_and_methodology": "The cost estimations are based on current circumstances, projected resource needs, and assessments of federally-funded grant projects.  The Judiciary's requests reflect a 3% increase to their operating budget and include detailed breakdowns of funding needs for personnel, technology, and facility improvements.  Comparable programs and historical budgets, along with current caseloads and staffing levels were also taken into consideration.",
  "agency_impact": "The bill's passage will significantly impact the Judiciary's operations, requiring increased staffing across various courts and departments.  Administrative burdens will increase due to new programs and technology implementations.  Budgetary impacts include increased operating costs and reliance on bond funds for capital improvements, potentially straining resources in subsequent biennia.",
  "economic_impact": "The proposed measure is expected to generate positive economic effects through job creation and improved court efficiency.  Investments in infrastructure and technology could create new opportunities and improve public safety.  Reduced recidivism, as a result of improved services for at-risk populations, may yield cost savings in the long term.",
  "policy_impact": "HB 400 modifies existing laws and programs by making several specialty courts permanent and expanding court services in specific areas.  It aligns with broader legislative strategies aimed at improving public safety and access to justice.  The bill's potential effects on state governance include increased efficiency and improved service delivery within the judicial system.",
  "revenue_sources": "The primary funding source for the operating budget requests in HB 400 is state general funds.  Capital improvement projects will be funded through bond issuance.  The Judiciary is also exploring and communicating about the potential impacts of uncertain federal funding on their budget and operations.",
  "six_year_fiscal_implications": "The six-year fiscal implications involve significant recurring costs. FY2026 and FY2027 see immediate increases in operating budget and FTE positions.  The ongoing costs associated with these new positions and programs will continue into the following biennium and beyond, impacting the long-term sustainability of the Judiciary’s budget.   Bond funds for capital projects will have a one-time impact in FY2026, but future maintenance of new facilities must be considered.  The ongoing need for cybersecurity updates and technology replacements is a continuous recurring expense.  Program expansion is projected based on current caseloads and staff needs. The long-term implications include continuous staffing needs and the need for ongoing funding to ensure program sustainability.  The establishment of permanent programs, such as the Women's Court, will need continued budgetary support. The new South Kohala District Courthouse will require long-term maintenance. Funding for technology upgrades will need consistent appropriation to maintain a secure and efficient system. ",
  "operating_revenue_impact": "The bill is not expected to directly impact operating revenues.  Improved court efficiency and potentially reduced recidivism could indirectly contribute to cost savings over the long run, but this is not a direct impact on operating revenue streams.  There are no anticipated increases or decreases in court fees or other revenue sources as a direct result of this bill.",
  "capital_expenditure_impact": "HB 400 includes significant capital expenditure requests, particularly for the new South Kohala District Courthouse and statewide building improvements.  The $11.9 million in bond funds will necessitate the Judiciary’s project management to execute construction and renovation plans effectively.   Ongoing maintenance costs for new facilities should be considered within future budgets.",
  "fiscal_implications_after_6_years": "After six years, the Judiciary will face ongoing fiscal obligations related to salaries for newly added positions and the maintenance of new facilities and equipment.  The number of program sites will remain consistent, assuming the bill's programs become permanent.   Continued funding will be necessary to ensure the long-term sustainability of both the expanded operating budget and new capital improvements."
