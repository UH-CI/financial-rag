S.D. 1
Honorable Ronald D. Kouchi
President of the Senate
Thirty-Third State Legislature
Regular Session of 2025
State of Hawaii
Sir:
Your Committee on
Judiciary, to which was referred H.B. No. 400, H.D. 1, entitled:
"A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO THE JUDICIARY,"
begs leave to report as follows:
The
purpose and intent of this measure is to provide for the expenses of the
judicial branch of the State of Hawaii.
Specifically, this
measure appropriates moneys for the Judiciary for the fiscal biennium that
begins on July 1, 2025, and ends on June 30, 2027.
Your Committee
received testimony in support of this measure from the Judiciary, Department of
Education, Volunteer Legal Services Hawaii, The Legal Clinic, Hawaii State Bar
Association, SanHi Government Strategies, Legal Aid Society of Hawaii, and one
individual.
Your Committee finds
that the appropriations made by this measure are intended to assist the
Judiciary in its efforts to fulfill its constitutional and statutory duties
during the 2025‑2027 fiscal biennium.
Your Committee
recognizes the current efforts of the federal government to downsize or
eliminate certain federal programs and to increase the number and rate of
deportations.
Your Committee further
recognizes the potential impacts of these actions on people in Hawaii,
including increased costs and adverse consequences for families and businesses.
Accordingly, your Committee recommends that
the Judiciary budget be amended by providing an additional $1,000,000 for civil
legal services and $750,000 for legal services to individuals in
immigration-related court proceedings.
Your Committee has
amended this measure by:
(1)
Increasing the appropriation for Administration
(JUD601) by $1,750,000;
(2)
Providing for an unspecified sum to be
expended by Administration (JUD601) for civil legal services;
(3)
Providing for an unspecified sum to be
expended by Administration (JUD601) for legal services for individuals in
immigration-related proceedings in immigration court; and
(4)
Changing the effective date to April 23, 2057,
to facilitate further discussion on the measure.
As affirmed by the
record of votes of the members of your Committee on Judiciary that is attached
to this report, your Committee is in accord with the intent and purpose of H.B.
No. 400, H.D. 1, as amended herein, and recommends that it pass Second
Reading in the form attached hereto as H.B. No. 400, H.D. 1,
S.D. 1, and be referred to your Committee on Ways and Means.
Respectfully submitted on behalf
of the members of the Committee on Judiciary,
