# =============================================================================
# UVICORN WORKER CONFIGURATION
# =============================================================================

# Development: Single worker for easier debugging
# WORKERS=1
# LOG_LEVEL=debug

# Development with multiple workers (for testing production-like setup)
# WORKERS=4
# LOG_LEVEL=info

# Production: Multiple workers for performance
# WORKERS=8
# LOG_LEVEL=info

# Heavy load production: Maximum workers (adjust based on your server specs)
# WORKERS=12
# LOG_LEVEL=warning

# =============================================================================
# USAGE EXAMPLES
# =============================================================================

# 1. Default development (1 worker, debug logging):
#    docker-compose up -d

# 2. Development with multiple workers:
#    WORKERS=4 docker-compose up -d

# 3. Production deployment:
#    docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d

# 4. Production with custom workers:
#    WORKERS=8 docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d

# =============================================================================
# WORKER COUNT GUIDELINES
# =============================================================================

# Development:
# - 1 worker: Easier debugging, simpler logs
# - 2-4 workers: Test multi-worker behavior

# Production:
# - 4 workers: Good default for most servers
# - 8 workers: High-performance servers (8+ CPU cores)
# - 12+ workers: Very high-load scenarios (16+ CPU cores, 32GB+ RAM)

# Note: Too many workers can actually hurt performance due to context switching
# Recommended: (CPU cores * 2) + 1, but test what works best for your workload
